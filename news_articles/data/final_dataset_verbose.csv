But as more countries hunt for a greater share of revenue from multinationals, concerns remain that disagreements between global agencies about which nation is entitled to tax profits could spark revenue wars.

Nevertheless, in a local context the Diverted Profits Tax (DPT), informally dubbed Australia's ""Google tax"", has already had a big impact on the behaviour of multinationals.

A number of companies including tech giant Google restructured their tax affairs in anticipation of the laws passing and others have been negotiating with Tax Commissioner Chris Jordan.

The federal government said the DPT, to commence on July 1 2017, would raise about $100 million in revenue a year from 2018-19.

Australia has a range of other laws aimed at multinationals and the ATO already has audits of big companies under way, which could see up to $2 billion in revenue flowing in, depending on whether or not those companies fight their tax bills.

Big profits targeted

The DPT laws are aimed at multinationals with global revenue of more than $1 billion and Australian revenue of greater than $25 million. They will be hit with a 40 per cent tax on all profits - that is 10 per cent higher than the 30 per cent company tax rate.

It aims to ensure that the tax paid by global entities properly reflects the economic substance of their activities in Australia and prevents the diversion of profits offshore through contrived arrangements.

The tax does not apply to managed investment trusts or similar foreign entities, sovereign wealth funds and foreign pension funds.

It will, however, encourage significant global entities to provide greater information to the ATO to allow for the timely resolution of tax disputes.

Treasurer Scott Morrison announced the legislation in the 2016-17 budget in response to public outcry over companies shifting billions of dollars in profits each year to lower-tax nations.

Mr Morrison told Parliament the laws will ""encourage greater cooperation between unco-operative multinationals and the ATO"".

Timelier resolution?

""As a result this will greatly reduce the length of disputes between the ATO and multinationals, and lead to timelier dispute resolution,"" he said.

Australia followed the lead of Britain, which has a similar laws aimed at multinationals which resulted in Google agreeing to a deal with that country's tax authorities to pay £130 million ($214 million) in back taxes.

""It provides a powerful new tool for the Australian Taxation Office to tackle contrived arrangements and unco-operative taxpayers, and will reinforce Australia's position as having some of the toughest laws in the world to combat multinational tax avoidance,"" Mr Morrison said.

But shadow assistant treasurer Andrew Leigh said the government was ""waging a phoney war on multinationals"".

""The fact is that the government estimates their Diverted Profits Tax will raise just one-eighth of the revenue that Labor would raise through closing debt-deduction loopholes,"" he said.

""Since coming to office, the Turnbull government has cut over 3000 staff from the tax office. With fewer staff, it's harder for the tax office to enforce their laws.""

The staff cuts have happened in the midst of several laws being passed. The Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law (MAAL), introduced in January this year, which also targets multinational profit shifting by boosting the ATO's anti-avoidance powers.

The ATO also has at its disposal tough transfer pricing rules.

The government in last year's budget also announced a 1300-member ATO tax avoidance taskforce that would be dedicated to stopping rorting by multinationals, private companies and wealthy individuals. That measure is expected to raise $3.7 billion up to 2020.

Audits underway

In a speech at The Tax Institute's conference in Adelaide earlier this month, Mr Jordan said the federal government's tax avoidance taskforce was aimed at catching companies ""who are not doing the right thing"".

There were already 71 audits under way in the large business area covering 59 multinational corporations, Mr Jordan said.

At least seven major multinational audits were expected to come to a head before June 30, Mr Jordan said, four in e-commerce and three in the energy and resource industries. The ATO expects liabilities to total more than $2 billion from these seven companies.

Oxfam Australia spokeswoman Joy Kyriacou welcomed the passing of the DPT laws, but said more needed to be done to stop about $6 billion of offshoring of profits by Australian-based multinationals.

She said the government needs to ensure country-by-country reporting of tax affairs for all big businesses happens and is made public.

""Australian Tax Office data shows more than one in three big companies are paying no tax,"" she said.

""Big companies operating from Australia should be required to be transparent and publicly report on their profits, taxes and assets for every country in which they operate, so it's harder for them to shift profits and dodge paying their fair share.""

""I was the odd man out,"" Ramji tells Business Insider.

Nowadays, Ramji is about four months into a new gig serving as VP of Product Management for Google Cloud, a service where developers rent functionally unlimited supercomputing power straight from the search engine's own global server infrastructure.

And while Google has never been shy about its love for open source, Ramji still says his new role is ""not too different"" than his time at Microsoft. Ramji's job is ""building bridges"" with programmers, working to convince them that Google, not Microsoft or Amazon, is the right digital home for their most critical software.

The opportunity is huge, says Ramji, but so is the challenge. From his perspective, Google can win developers over, just as long as it doesn't abandon Larry Page and Sergey Brin's famous 2004 declaration that ""Google is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one.""

In other words, Ramji says, he thinks Google can win against the leading Amazon Web Services and the second-place Microsoft Azure clouds by ""being enterprise-y, but staying Google-y.""

The push for enterprise

Under the leadership of VMware cofounder Diane Greene, Google Cloud has been making a major push to close its competitive gap by selling the service to large businesses.

To Ramji, the gameplan is pretty straightforward: Build a service that developers, all kinds of developers, actually like using. Very often, the programmers in even the biggest, stodgiest, most bureaucratic companies still do their own personal projects on nights and weekends.

""Enterprise developers are developers on the weekend, too,"" Ramji says. ""An enterprise developer is just a developer who works at an enterprise.""

That's key to the Google gameplan, says Ramji. Even if the IT department is wary of giving Google Cloud a look after many years of being happy Microsoft or Amazon customers, Ramji's plan is to reach out to communities of developers and convince them to give it a shot.

From there, Ramji highlights the progress that Google has made in getting its cloud prepped for the largest companies. A major push for Google is in making sure that its cloud computing platform integrates both with their customers data centers (called ""hybrid cloud"") as well as with other providers, including Amazon and Microsoft.

""Enterprises need a cloud provider that respects their architecture, which is multi-cloud and hybrid,"" Ramji says.

The challenge

So, that's the strategy. Now, Ramji has to think tactically about the best way of rolling out the red carpet for developers.

""There's still an awareness gap,"" says Ramji, so ""our front door has to be awesome.""

A big part of the reason Ramji made the switch from his previous gig as CEO of the Cloud Foundry Foundation, a nonprofit software organization, was because he kept hearing and seeing that Google Cloud was faster and cheaper than the competition.

That performance is great, Ramji says, and something Google is going to keep investing in. But with so much marketing buzz around each cloud, and a general perception that the major cloud platforms are pretty much equivalent feature-wise, it takes more to win over developers.

He says that stuff like offering developers free Google Cloud services, giving them plenty of documentation for how to use it, and generally working with the community is a huge help — Ramji says that Google Cloud engineers often hop into Reddit or Hacker News threads to offer help and advice.

Plus, Ramji says, Google runs a few different programs to embed its engineers and systems architects in with customers, helping them build and manage their software in the same way that Google itself does.

""We're here before and after the sale,"" Ramji says.

The Google advantage

There's a more ineffable advantage held by Google, says Ramji. In his time as an industry exec, Ramji has been around the block a few times, working at tech companies large and small. But he says he's continually impressed with the sheer quantity of smart people at the company working on big-impact passion projects.

He describes the general feeling at Google as ""like a Montessori school where the kids are in charge.""

In his experience, however limited, that means that there's also an astonishing number of Googlers who come into Google Cloud, stay for a while, and then go off to work on Google Docs or search advertising or even take posts at the self-driving car spinoff Google, and vice versa. It means a constant flow of fresh talent with different skillsets.

""We don't hire for the job, we hire for Google,"" says Ramji.

In its own way, though, that could be a potential roadblock, says Ramji. When you're inside Google, you get used to doing things at Google's pace. That has the potential to alienate Google Cloud customers, Ramji says, if they mishandle things, given that most large companies don't build software at Google's speed.

""Sometimes you'll accelerate too fast and the wheels falls off,"" Ramji says.

Avere, founded in 2008, accelerates access to files in NAS arrays by using a multi-tiered media approach and treating different IO types, such as read and write, sequential and random, differently so as to optimise the system for faster accesses.

There was participation from existing investors - Menlo Ventures, Norwest Venture Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Tenaya Capital and Western Digital Technologies - as well as its new investor, Google Inc, which notably did not invest through its funding arm, GV (Google Ventures).

Initially the amount was reported as $14m but, after the initial funding announcement was made, there was an additional amount added to the round by the investors, bringing it up to $27m.

The company says it wants to use the new funds to drive product innovation and help expand its hybrid cloud product offerings.

CEO, president and co-founder Ron Bianchini said: “In 2016 alone, Avere has grown its cloud business by 97 per cent, nearly doubling growth from the previous year, and closed the year with cloud offerings driving close to half of our annual bookings.”

The nine-year-old firm developed its technology to run in remote and branch offices, also to front-end public cloud storage, and then extended its software to run in the public cloud.

The company sees its customers using a mix of on-premises (private) and public cloud storage and compute facilities; it’s a hybrid world as far as it is concerned.

It received a $15m A-round in 2009, a $17m B-round in 2010, a $20m C-round in 2012, and another $20m in a 2014 D-round. With the latest E-round, total funding is now $97m.

We asked Bianchini some questions around the new funding.

El Reg: How far away is profitability?

Ron Bianchini: Our current forecast show us reaching profitability in 2018.

El Reg: What are the features of the hybrid cloud (in more detail than the release) that you will be using the E-round funding for?

Ron Bianchini: We're not ready to discuss new cloud products at this time; however, big areas of continued focus for us are ease of deployment within the public cloud and further in-cloud performance and scalability enhancements.

El Reg: Will you aim to take advantage of 3D Xpoint and possibly other storage-class memory media in your products? Where would such media fit in your existing media tiers in your hardware?

Ron Bianchini: It is not on the roadmap at this time, but we like to think of our architecture as storage media agnostic. When one type of media has outlived its usefulness, there is no technical reason why it can't or shouldn't be replaced with something better.

El Reg: What public clouds do you support, which are on the roadmap? What protocols will be used to access them?

Ron Bianchini: We support Google, AWS and Azure (bursting only). No others are currently on the roadmap - these three representing more than 90 per cent market share of public cloud spend. We use S3 to access the storage portion of the cloud and NAS protocols for cloudbursting.

El Reg: Do you have a multi-cloud strategy, with your customers able to use two or more public clouds simultaneously?

Ron Bianchini: Yes, this is one of the strengths of an Avere solution, to provide customers the ability to mirror storage between clouds with our FlashMirror product. This is a popular feature for customers who want to avoid lock-in to a single cloud provider.

El Reg: Any Internet of Things edge device interest from Avere?

Ron Bianchini: We are interested in supporting any devices that speak the same protocol language as we do.

+Comment

Fishing for new product info in Avere’s pool is a pretty unrewarding pastime. Our thinking is that $27m is a healthy dose of cash and that some of it will fund software development to enhance the in-cloud product’s performance and scalability.

We also think that on-premises FXT kit will get easier interaction with the public cloud, but it doesn't take a genius to work that out. ®",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But after a new update, in Incognito mode this smiley face instead becomes a winking face.

Chrome's new winking message only appears on the Android version of the app.

In iOS versions of the browser, opening 100 Incognito tabs simply brings up a normal smiley face.

For heavy users of Google's Incognito tab a winking face (pictured) pops up after opening 100 tabs, a cheeky nod to the private browser's notoriety as a platform for watching pornography in secret. The 'Easter egg' only pops up for Android users of the browser

It is not known if the company intends to include the tongue-in-cheek message in its iOS browser in future.

'We're not sure why this happens, but we think it may be that the app wasn't designed to have more than two characters in the number of tabs field,' Mashable journalist Freia Lobo said.

It's clear from the numbers. Google has a diversity problem.

For the past few years, the company has publicly shared its workplace makeup in a report detailing the race, gender and ethnicity of each employee hired the previous year. Last year, while the number of black employees went up, they still represented only 2 percent of the company's workforce and Google admitted it fell short of its diversity goal.

In one small step to grow those numbers, this summer 25 students from Howard University, the historically black university based in Washington, D.C., will train at the tech giant's headquarters in Mountain View, Caif.

With Howard West, as it's being called, Google believes it can meet that goal faster, says Bonita Stewart, the company's vice president of global partnerships.

""We have the opportunity to be able to build a qualified pipeline of talent across the black community,"" she says.

The pipeline, or the pipeline problem, is an idea commonly held in Silicon Valley that there just aren't enough blacks, Latinos and women with computer programming skills to fill jobs.

The 25 students at Howard West will be mentored by Google engineers and get regular classroom instruction from Howard professors.

Howard and Google plan to train 750 students over five years and will open the program to students from all historically black colleges and universities, or HBCUs. Wayne A.I. Frederick, Howard's president, says this is an important step, ""but I think just as important, will be exposure to the culture here.""

Frederick heard from alums working in the industry, who said they felt Howard prepared them technically, but not culturally, to work in Silicon Valley. There's the management style, which values collaboration over hierarchy, the importance of networking and, of course, how to dress.

""So, for instance, I'm dressed in a suit and tie, and I haven't seen anybody else in a suit and a tie,"" he says, jokingly. ""So that's one example to just being exposed to that culture.""

Christian Simamora, of Code2040, a nonprofit dedicated to increasing the number of blacks and Latinos in the tech sector, applauds the opening of Howard West. He's concerned, though, that the narrative will become, ""there's a pipeline problem,"" he says.

""We would hire more black engineers if we could find them,"" Simamora says, mimicking a common refrain from tech companies. ""The fact of the matter is the talent is there.""

Simamora points out that about 18 percent of computer science majors in the U.S. identify as black or Latino, but they represent only 5 percent of the technology workforce. He says the problem is with recruitment.

""Many of the top tech companies aren't even recruiting at the HBCUs — Howard, Spelman. All these schools have CS programs.""

So why aren't big tech companies recruiting at HBCUs?

""I can't speak for those companies,"" he says. ""But what I find interesting is that tech disrupts; tech hiring does not disrupt. It does not question what came before it.""

Simamora says many tech companies continue to focus their recruitment efforts at a few schools, like Stanford, Harvard and MIT - the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Considering that, Simamora says the opening of Howard West at Google is disruptive and might force the tech industry to start acting differently.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When is the Google Home UK release date?

Google Home is already available in the US, where you can buy a Google Home for $129. In the UK Google Home will go on sale on 6 April 2017.

Don't be tempted to import a Google Home as some of the services won't work in the UK and the warranty will be void, too. (Google has made the latter part very clear.)

Plus, you'd need a UK adaptor in order to be able to power it, and while you'll be able to control music playback and it will work with your Chromecast.

You can also ask the assistant the usual questions, you won't find an UK-specific services, nor an UK news briefings (outside of BBC World Service).

For the sake of a few weeks, it's worth waiting for the official UK version.

How much will Google Home cost in the UK?

Google Home will cost £129 in the UK, which is the same price as Google Wifi. Coloured bases will cost £18 for fabric and £36 for metal.

It will be available direct from the Google Store, as well as Argos, Currys, John Lewis and Maplin, and will be coming soon to EE.

What is the Google Assistant?

Google Assistant is the new conversational 'bot' that was announced at Google I/O 2016. It's an extension of Google Now but, a bit like Siri, allows better two-way conversations.

Google says this is due to advances in AI and machine learning, giving the all-important context to conversations.

One example given was booking cinema tickets. You could say to the assistant, ""What's playing tonight?"" and it would understand you want to know which films are showing at your local cinema.

After displaying a few titles, you could say ""We're planning on bringing the kids"" at which point the assistant shows family-friendly films.

You could then say ""Ok, let's see Jungle Book"", and the assistant could purchase four tickets and display a QR code you can show at the door. But the conversation could have ""gone many different ways"", said Pichai.

We discussed the Google event right after it happened on our podcast. Listen here:

Instead of choosing a film from the selection, you could say ""Is Jungle Book any good"" and the assistant would check reviews, display ratings from IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes, and offer up the trailer to watch.

The Google Assistant isn't limited to Google Home of course. It first appeared on Google's Pixel phones, but is now beginning to roll out on other Android phones.

Google's Rick Osterloh reckons that Home will best Amazon's Alexa assistant because Google has a richer history of people making voice queries through its browser and Android phones.

This means that the Google Assistant is better placed to ""really understand what people are asking for"" than Alexa, which relies on Microsoft's Bing search engine and Wikipedia to answer a lot of questions.

Also, a report by Android Police says that Google is probably working on making Home able to recognise users' voices. This will overcome the current limitation of being signed into only one Google account, which is fine if you live alone, but not so useful in a family home or shared household where the assistant's answers are based on someone else's Google profile.

If Home can indeed recognise a voice and switch to that person's account on the fly, they will be able to find out what meetings they have that day and whether there are delays on their commute.

Currently, both Home and Amazon's Alexa can do those things, but only for one account. (You can manually change accounts using the apps, but this is a hassle no-one wants.)

Amazon may have a much bigger library of 'skills', which will help the Echo and other Alexa-enabled devices to remain popular, but unless it can improve Alexa's ability to answer questions rather than simply respond to commands, sales may suffer against Google Home.

Google Home features

The small device has interchangeable bases, in various colours, metal and fabric finishes, allowing you to tailor it to your décor, making it ideal for different environments around the house.

Under the interchangeable grill there is a speaker. There are three speakers to be precise, one low-end driver and two 'dual-passive' drivers aimed to deliver a complete frequency range.

We have yet to hear it in a home (having only seen it at demos) so can't comment on these claims, but the speakers will play your favourite songs and allow the assistant to talk to you. Also see: Best Bluetooth speakers.

The device itself is smaller than you might think: you can see the scale in the photo below. This means Google Home should be discrete in pretty much any room.

At the top of the device, there's a 'display' which has four small LEDs which allow you to interact with the device. It doesn't have any buttons on top but uses dual microphones to listen for your voice.

The device has a single button located on its shell, allowing you to mute the microphone - useful for times when you don't want it responding. Unfortunately, it doesn't have an SD card/microSD card slot or a USB port - so you won't be able to plug and play your own music through a physical device.

You can set alarms, set timers, alarms, create shopping lists, and Home will also support other smart home devices such as the Nest thermostat (owned by Google), lights and other connected devices.

We're excited to see the possibilities in the future, with Google wanting to open the device to other manufacturers and allow you to even order flowers or hire a car straight from your Google Home.

Mutliple Google Homes can be placed around the house so you can use it wherever you are. As well as working when you're close to the device and there's little ambient noise, Google has also worked hard to ensure excellent far-field voice recognition, which means it will work just as well if you say ""Ok Google, reserve a table at Pizza Express for four at 8pm tonight"" from across the room while the TV's on.

You don't always have to start the conversation. Home can playing an alert tone, and you can respond with ""Ok Google, I'm listening"". Home will then read out the alert such as, ""Your flight is delayed by 30 minutes"" and also give a short traffic report. On the back of that, you could ask the assistant to change your dinner reservation.

In February, Google Home owners in the US got the ability to order products in much the same way you can on an Amazon Echo. It uses the Google Express service and allows you to get products delivered to your home the same day - as long as you live in one of the 12 supported states.

There's a minimum order value, and delivery fees apply in addition to the annual membership fee for Google Express, but if you're willing to stump up you can now say to the Google Assistant, ""OK Google, order Duracell AA batteries"".

As it's a new service, there's a free three-month trial with free delivery in order to entice people to try it out.

The U.S. tech giant left China more than seven years ago when it redirected its local search engine to Hong Kong and many of its services are censored in the country. Today’s low-key relaunch marks the first time it has revived a service specifically for users in China.

Google has maintained a web-based version of Translate that has been accessible since its China exit, but with half of China’s 1.4 billion population using the internet on mobile, according to the latest government figures, these apps will give the service wider reach. The iOS version of Translate is available in the Chinese App Store, while Google is directing Android users to a direct download from its servers here. Previously, those in China could only use the app when connected to a VPN to evade the government’s internet censorship system.

“Google Translate has been available in China for more than eight years. Today, we’re making our Translate app work better for Chinese users,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch.

The apps will be maintained by Google’s joint-venture in China, which runs the services it has remaining there, and will be subject to any government-issued requests or censorship, Google confirmed.

Google added that users of the Chinese version have full access to the service, which includes Word Lens, the feature that translates text from photos snapped inside the app. Word Lens gained support Chinese last year and Chinese was the first language Google picked for its new machine learning translation technology, which went live last September and hugely advanced the way the service works.

“With today’s update, we’re hoping to make the Translate experience better for Chinese users, helping break down language barriers by connecting people around the world,” Google wrote in a blog post.

The launch was applauded by GreatFire, a nonprofit group that tracks internet censorship in China and has helped the BBC, The New York Times and other media beat Chinese censors.

“I am encouraged that Google is making the app available for direct download, in essence thwarting censorship of the Google Play store in China,” said Charlie Smith, the organization’s pseudonymous head.

“I hope that Google will provide support and guidance to app developers who want to adopt similar tactics and I applaud Google for finally deploying an effective anti-censorship initiative in China,” Smith added.

Publicly, at least, Google is saying that the launch of the Chinese version of the app is about giving more options to Chinese internet users, who also have services from Baidu and other Chinese companies available, but today’s news marks a notable advance on its China strategy.

Translate won’t generate revenue for Google, but it may boost its visibility among Chinese internet users. Potentially, it sets a precedent for introducing China-specific versions of other Google apps and services in the future, although the company declined to comment when we asked it about that directly.

Then there’s also the possibility that this launch is a litmus test or precursor to the re-introduction of Google Play in China.

Reuters, The Information and other media have consistently reported over the past year that Google harbors ambitions to bring the Google Play Store to Chinese soil. Despite the rumblings, there’s been no concrete advance on this apparent objective. Even then, there’s no guarantee that any such move would be successful. China’s Android ecosystem is dominated by a number of third-party app stores, including 91 Wireless (acquired by Baidu for $1.9 billion in 2013), Alibaba-owned Wandoujia and offerings from Tencent and Xiaomi.

China’s colossal base of more than 730 million internet users has turned it into an important market for mobile. The country recently overtook the U.S. to become the world’s most lucrative market for iOS app developers, and it’s a market where Google has little footprint. The company connected China-based developers with its global app store footprint two years ago, but it’s no surprise that Google is reported to be exploring the possibilities inside China.

Although the company is still not completely out of the unpleasant situation, judging by yesterday's tiny bounce in the stock, the worst could be in the rear-view mirror.

Google has stated that they are working to solve the problem but as of late last week, there were some ads still popping up alongside questionable content on YouTube.

Google shares lost about 4.5% last week as investors were quick to pull the trigger, which they are inclined to do and then worry about the questions later. That shaved about $22 billion off Google's market capitalization last week.

As one can surmise, the analysts that follow Google on Wall Street had a lot to say on the topic.

UBS came out with an update that said that it was not hearing anything that would cause the analyst to change its long term estimates on the company and that it was keeping its Buy rating and maintaining its $980 price target on Google. In addition, based on its contacts in the industry, many clients quickly took advantage of the situation to try and negotiate better ad rates from Google. That indicates to me that a majority of the clients have already moved past the issue and are trying to turn the situation to their advantage. Not a bad thing, no?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While nobody could deny that Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) has been a smashing success, those FB stock holders who keep close tabs on the company's operations know all too well there will come a time when the company can't add new users at a breakneck clip, and can't cram any more advertisements onto each member's page .

Source: SilverIsdead Via Flickr

What if, however, Facebook could come up with a way of selling ads outside of its flagship social networking site?

Actually, it has been doing that for a while, though has struggled to make a dent in the North American display ad market, which is mostly owned by Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ), via Google. With a little help from Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and others though, Facebook is now positioned to take a bigger bite out of that pie.

Facebook Rolls Out Header Bidding

It's not a description that does the idea justice, but it does set the stage - header bidding is a way a website operator, or ""publisher,"" can pick the display ad that pays the most for appearing on a particular web page.

In the web's early days, it wasn't always clear to an advertiser if the ad space they were buying was worth it.

Likewise, it wasn't clear to a publisher if the ad space they were selling was the best price they could achieve. But, in that the communication of such information was poor, both parties relied on the middleman (usually Google) to do the best it could do, and keep a few pennies per impression for itself.

A lot has changed since the dawn of display ads, though. Namely, not unlike a stock exchange, a buyer and seller of web ads can now see the market's best bid and offer.

It's not exactly a new idea. Facebook announced it was developing this so-called Facebook Audience in August of last year. That was a soft launch though, and didn't include all of its possible partners that will provide the underlying technology. It wasn't until this week the product officially launched, with Amazon.com's header-bidding platform being one of six ad networks participating , all competing for business.

Google Beware

While FB stock owners have good reason to be excited, Google is still Google, and is a force to be reckoned with. It won't go down easy.

And yet, thus far it has not developed a weapon that it can effectively fend off the growing tide of header bidding. Its best response has been what it calls Dynamic Allocation … a sort of hybrid of header bidding and its traditional ad-sales approach. Advertisers aren't impressed, however, saying it only benefits Alphabet.

Sortable's Chris Reid opined last year that the advent of header bidding could drive Google's display ad market share from 90% to something between 40% and 50%. Conversely, publishers participating in the early dry runs of its Audience Network program saw revenue grow between 10% and 30% .

With those metrics on the table, something explained last year in the wake of the soft launch of Facebook's header bidding plans was very much on target:

""Google is frankly very defensive because their position is being threatened. If you now amplify that by Facebook saying, 'Hey, wait a second, look, there's a chink in the armor. All these independent companies have found it, why don't we do the same thing and bring our wallet to bear?' We're actually going to start to see an event that could at a very, very substantial level check the Google monopoly.""

Further threatening Google is the fact that Amazon and Facebook may be better equipped to build a profile of a particular user than Google is, delivering more targeted ads from one device to the next. In other words, based on a user's PC history, the network can deliver a specific ad to that user on his or her mobile device.

Google's user profiles allow for highly targeted ads as well, though that aging approach may not be as refined and updated as the one offered by Audience Network.

Bottom Line for FB Stock

The ultimate impact the new version of Audience Network may have on the profitability of FB stock isn't perfectly clear. There is clearly an upside though, with little to no downside.

To the extent guesses are being made though, observers are apt to be underestimating the benefit the new scheme will have. Google's size and disinterest in being competitive have given rise to the new competition Facebook is now supporting. Advertisers are already trying that ""something else"" besides Google, and liking the switch.

Stocks look to start their climb higher this morning, though just slightly. All three of the major indices touched-up on their respective 50-day moving averages during trading yesterday to find some support. This is the first time that technicals have had to step in as support since December.

The next two days will determine success or failure, so traders will spend their days trading both sides of the market for the rest of the week to see how this first test of 2017 plays out.

Today's three big stock charts looks at the price musings of United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE: UPS ), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Amgen, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMGN ) as three stocks that are facing similarly critical tests of their technical standings.

United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS)

The logistics/delivery company has been locked in a trading range since its disappointing earnings report dropped the shares by more than 10%. Now, after several tests of what has turned into critical chart support, UPS shares are testing $104 for support again.

The level ($104) can be tracked back to April and May of 2016 as a significant support level, which is why the traders are keying some buying off it now.

The touch of $104 comes while UPS shares are touching down on oversold readings from the stock's RSI. This indicates that the flow of selling pressure is likely to ebb and fewer buyers will be needed to change the momentum for the short-term.

A break below $104 will target another 4% to 5% decline in the shares as $100 is the next clear line of support. According to our model, the stock remains in the short- and intermediate-term bearish category given the technical breakdowns and the declining 50-day moving average.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL)

Alphabet shares have snapped lower over the last week and now reside in a technical ""rock and hard place"" situation.

GOOGL stock sold out of an overbought situation as it hit $875 right through its first level of support drawn by its 50-day moving average at $843. Friday and Monday's additional selling pressure dropped Alphabet stock to test its 100-day moving average at $825. This is the second time that GOOGL shares have fallen against this trendline for support in as many months.

Traders need to keep an eye on the trend of the 50-day moving average on Alphabet stock as it appears to be transitioning from a bullish ascending pattern to a neutral and potentially bearish declining trend. This will have a negative implication on the price target for GOOGL shares over the short-term outlook.

For now, maintain an eye on $820, which represents the stock's 100-day moving average. A break below this will see Alphabet move into that short-term bearish pattern with an initial price target of $800.

Amgen, Inc. (AMGN)

Amgen shares continue to recover from the news that their newest cholesterol drug, Repatha, didn't trial as well as expected. AMGN stock has shed about 12% since that news took shares downs.

It appears that much of the selling has been squeezed out of the market as the stock is landing close to technical support levels that should help to build a case for short-term bulls.

First, Amgen shares entered an oversold position last week on the decline below $170. This called for a likely short-term bounce, which has yet to be seen.

Second, while AMGN shares could slice through their 50-day moving averages, the stock still has two important technical lifelines.

The 200-day moving average for Amgen shares is trading at $161 indicating potential support. This same price level has seen significant price support and resistance over the last six months, strengthening the argument that we will see buyers enter the market at this price.

Finally, AMGN's 100-day moving average, which just transitioned into a bullish pattern itself, is bringing support at $157 in case Amgen can crack through $161.

Bottom line for technical traders is that the headline effect of Repatha is likely wearing off and the technicals, which remains bullish, should bring AMGN stock back into its intermediate-term bullish climb.

As of this writing, Johnson Research Group did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Apple ( AAPL ) changed the way we communicate, Amazon ( AMZN ) changed the way consumers shop and Alphabet 's ( GOOG ) ( GOOGL ) Google changed the way people use the internet to find an infinite wealth of information within a second of pressing a button on a keyboard. But, there is always room for more disruptions.

Here's the new kid on the block, Aqua Metals Inc. ( AQMS ), a company that may be on the verge of joining this list of disruptive elite to become the first and only company that has the technological capacity to reinvent the lead-acid recycling industry. As far as Aqua Metals is concerned, smelting, the environmentally poisonous method of recycling lead from used and discarded batteries, should be a thing of the past. With the patent-pending AquaRefining method, not only is the company's method a technological breakthrough, it is one that can be quickly endorsed and sponsored by both lawmakers and environmentalists alike. Even legislators supported by the fat wallet lobbyists will have a hard time explaining why they do not support this method of extracting lead-acids over existing and now antiquated ones.

AquaRefining uses water

The technology is very advanced and, without a doubt, may be hard to comprehend at first glance. How is this for innovation - the technology uses room-temperature water to extract and recycle lead-acid from batteries. Vastly different from smelting, the patent-pending AquaRefining technology is a room-temperature, water-based process that is fundamentally non-polluting. Because of this non-firing method, the modular systems not only allow the extraction of lead-acid compounds, but simultaneously improve environmental impact and provide the ability to scale production to meet rapidly growing demand for lead-acid based products.

Building the first AquaRefining facility in Nevada's Tahoe Reno Industrial Complex, the company's focus is to reduce the refining inefficiency, costs and toxic waste associated with conventional smelter-based recycling of lead-acid batteries. The technology not only delivers a breakthrough process, but it also produces a better product at a higher yield and eliminates toxic waste. Of additional value is the process significantly reduces the permitting process. Building a new AquaRefining facility requires a substantially smaller capital expenditure over the construction of smelting facilities.

Industry endorsements

The stock is now trading at $18.15 a share, up from approximately $13 at the start of the year. While the stock has been reacting extremely well over the past several months, Aqua Metals is still somewhat under the radar as far as retail investors are concerned. That is not to say the recycling industry is not recognizing the potential for this company to grow exponentially over the next decade, as well as being able to provide significant and beneficial environmental impact from its processes.

Aqua Metals received prestigious recognition from the ICIC Innovation Awards in 2016, was the winner of the Sustainable Technology Award at the IChem Global Awards in 2016 and is a 2016 Platts Global Award Winner in 2016. Apparently, the company is not some alchemist's dream of turning sand into gold. To the contrary, it has already proven its technology, is advancing its strategy and has already become a revenue-producing company.

Bolstering confidence, in February of this year the company signed a breakthrough agreement with Johnson Controls (JCI), which provided a tremendous first step forward in working with global leaders in the responsible recycling of automotive batteries. Under the terms of the agreement, Johnson Controls will become the first licensee for AquaRefining technology. In doing so, Johnson Controls will supply the company with batteries to recycle as a service, and Aqua Metals will be part of a closed-loop cycle with Johnson Controls. Additionally, Johnson Controls will purchase AquaRefined metals produced by the company and has also agreed to buy just under 5% of its outstanding shares of common stock.

Furthermore, Interstate Batteries, an industry giant, has also taken a substantial interest in the company, purchasing a stake in Aqua Metals as well. Under the terms of the agreements made in 2016, Interstate Batteries has agreed to supply more than a million automotive and other lead-acid batteries as feedstock for Aqua Metals' AquaRefineries. Interstate Batteries will also make a strategic investment of approximately $10 million into Aqua Metals. This strategic investment will be in the form of common stock, a fixed-price note that converts into common stock and two cash warrants to purchase common stock over the next three years. It should be pointed out that, as part of a diversification strategy, Interstate Batteries recently adopted a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan to reduce its ownership stake in Aqua Metals by 430,000 shares, with proposed sales offered at its discretion.

Getting the lead out

Industry disruption is good. For investors seeking a ground floor breakthrough opportunity, Aqua Metals may offer the closest thing to newly discovered alien technology on the planet. While I am an Area 51 enthusiast, making the comparison to otherworldly technology is not so off the wall. Aqua Metals is on the verge of replacing decades worth of old technology, substantially reducing toxic waste and environmental damage and replacing a process that is significantly more costly than what the company can deliver in a simpler fashion. And, it is doing this by using room-temperature water, a process that should soon make it into Ripley's Believe It or Not! Hall of Fame.

Investors should also appreciate the stakes taken by both Johnson Controls and Interstate, which may ultimately lead to additional support for the stock moving forward. Although Interstate is divesting some of its stake for diversification purposes, Johnson has not demonstrated the same willingness to let go of its stake.

In simplest terms, being disruptive prevents a company from being disrupted. If Aqua Metals was nothing more than a stock in the brainstorming and proof-of-concept phase, investor caution might be more warranted. That is not the case however.

Aqua Metals has the processes and facility in place, is producing revenue and its technology is being embraced globally. In that sense, if investors decide to get the lead out and invest at current share price levels, that decision appears to be well supported by industry experts and environmental watchdogs - two factions that have the ability to promote a peaceful transfer of power in the industry. In that respect, Aqua Metals' method of extraction may be both well received and endorsed, providing continued momentum for the company going forward.

One of the key reasons Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) - while it was still called Google - grew from nothing to an advertising behemoth in just a few years lies in the fact that much of what it offered was automated. Without the need for human intervention, it could cost-effectively offer ad space to advertisers with the click of a button (and payment, of course). This did wonders for GOOGL stock.

Source: Brionv via Wikimedia (Modified)

There does come a time, however, when a ""hands off"" approach to … well, pretty much everything can cause problems.

Alphabet stock holders were made well aware of that reality just last week when a couple of advertisers suspended their ad spending at YouTube when it was realized their advertisements prefaced some distasteful hate speech that surfaced at the popular online video venue.

In its defense, the company didn't know. As was noted, ad placements are essentially automated. On the other hand, it's arguable to say GOOGL should have known something like that could happen, and prevention measures should have been put in place. The debacle may force Alphabet to operate its advertising service with at least a little more human involvement.

A Big Mistake for GOOGL Stock?

Although several companies pulled the plug on their YouTube ads, AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T ) and Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ ) were a couple of the bigger names that called it quits … at least for the time being.

There was no specific event that prompted the boycotts, nor is it a brand new realization. But, the matter had been boiling over for a couple of weeks now, with an anti-Semitic clip video called ""Jewish World Order"" serving as the poster child of how vile the digital video venue can be, and how damning the power of association can be to a brand.

It's theoretically not supposed to happen. Aside from the fact that ads are intended to be targeted to a plausible potential customer, but knowing that automated filters aren't perfect, human judgment can also play a role in determining the appropriateness of an ad placement. Still, that's clearly not working either.

Alphabet responded:

""We don't comment on individual customers but as announced, we've begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear. We're also raising the bar for our ads policies to further safeguard our advertisers' brands.""

It's the right thing to do, but a little too late.

Impact on Alphabet Stock

And it's not just an embarrassing gaffe that will blow over, as most do. Nomura Instinet believes the advertiser boycott will shave $750 million off of the company's top line over the course of the remainder of 2017 .

That, however, isn't much in the grand scheme of things.

YouTube was projected to drive $7.7 billion in revenue for that three-quarter stretch. Alphabet has done $90.3 billion in revenue for the last four quarters. Of course, inasmuch as YouTube isn't profitable, the impact on the per-share profits of GOOGL stock may be nil.

Not all analysts are convinced the high-profile flub is going to do any lasting damage, however. Morgan Stanley calculates that the affected part of the company's ad business only makes up 10% of the organization's revenue machine , and boasts millions of advertisers. RBC Capital's math follows up on Nomura's calculation, pointing out that even in the event of a 10% lull in that arm's revenue, it would still only translate into a 1.7% lull in total revenue.

Bottom Line for GOOGL Stock

It's still not clear what, if anything, Alphabet specifically intends to do about the miscue and the subsequent fallout. And the plausible fiscal impact of the damage done is little more than guesswork at this point. Those matters, however, may be secondary.

While Google may still be the king of search and display ads and GOOGL stock is still one of the top picks in the industry, this is another dent in the company's reputation - and its operation. The automated approach of pairing up ads and publishers was clever when it was the only option, but the whole business of internet advertising has changed. Alphabet stock didn't change enough with it.

Case in point: Last year, an internet advertising arrangement called Header Bidding became all the rage. Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) took that ball and ran with it … and customers love it . Rather than adapt on the future of digital display ads, GOOGL doubled down on its version of the ad-selling approach that distinctly lacks the transparency so many Header Bidding users love. Most observers expect Alphabet stock to lose market share as long as it refuses to face Facebook head-on.

None of this means GOOGL stock is doomed, but between being lapped by Facebook and now clearly being unable to guarantee appropriate ad placements to its biggest customers, investors should start to ask some tough questions about Alphabet's sales and delivery model.

As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) are on a recovery track as they have regained 23.55% since bottoming out at $663.28 on Jun. 27, 2016. Meanwhile, due to an ongoing pressure which caused a decline of almost -3.41% in the past five days, the stock price is now up 6.18% so far on the year — still in strong territory. In this case, shares are down -3.98% from $853.5 , the 52-week high touched on Mar. 21, 2017, and are keeping their losses at 11.72% for the past 12 months.

Brokerage houses, on average, are recommending investors to buy Alphabet Inc. (GOOG)’s shares projecting a $970.75 target price. What do this target means? Price targets reflect what the analyst believes a stock will be worth four quarters into the future. Are investors supposed to sell when the stock hits the target? Price targets frequently change, depending on the outlook for a company’s earnings. Sometimes it may seem like it, but analysts don’t just pull their price targets out of thin air. Typically, they estimate what the company’s earnings and cash flow will be for the next couple of years, and then apply a ratio – such as a price-to-earnings ratio – to those estimates to determine what the future stock price should theoretically be.

GOOG’s revenue has declined at an average annualized rate of about 0% during the past five years. However, the company’s most recent quarter increase of 22.2% looks attractive.

While there are a number of profitability ratios that measure a company’s ability to generate profit from the sales or services it provides, one of the most important is the net profit margin. It tells us what percentage of revenue a company keeps after all its bills are paid. While the higher this number is, the better, there is no gold standard. That’s why this number shouldn’t be looked at in isolation, but should be compared to a company’s peer group as well as its sector. Currently, Alphabet Inc. net profit margin for the 12 months is at 21.58%. Comparatively, the peers have a net margin 16.64%, and the sector’s average is 4.7%. In that light, it seems in weak position compared to its peers and sector.

Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) is another stock that is grabbing investors attention these days. Its shares have trimmed -19.14% since hitting a peak level of $77.05 on Sep. 06, 2016. Meanwhile, due to a recent pullback which led to a fall of almost -0.98% in the past one month, the stock price is now outperforming with 0.62% so far on the year — still in weak zone. In this case, shares are 11.81% higher from $55.72, the worst price in 52 weeks suffered on Nov. 21, 2016, but are collecting gains at -18.3% for the past six months.

The good news is there’s still room for the share price to grow. At recent closing price of $61.84, TSN has a chance to add $7.16 or 11.58% in 52 weeks, based on mean target price ($69) placed by analysts.The analyst consensus opinion of 2.4 looks like a hold. It has a 36-month beta of 0.16 , so you might not be in for a bumpy ride.

For the past 5 years, Tyson Foods, Inc.’s EPS growth has been nearly 17.9%. Sure, the percentage is encouraging but better times are ahead as looking out over a next 5-year period, analysts expect the company to see its earnings go up by 2.27%, annually.

Two other important profitability ratios for investors to know are both returns-based ratios that measure a company’s ability to create wealth for shareholders. They are return on equity and return on assets. Return on equity measures is a company’s ability to turn an investor’s equity into profit. The higher the return on equity, the better job a company is at optimizing the investment made on shareholders’ behalf. Tyson Foods, Inc.’s ROE is 19.68%, while industry’s is 16.77%. The average ROE for the sector stands at 73.24%.

Return on assets, on the other hand, measures a company’s ability to turn assets such as cash, buildings, equipment, or inventory into more assets. TSN’s ROA is 8.36%, while industry’s average is 8.39%. As with any return, the higher this number the better. However, it, too, needs to be taken into the context of a company’s peer group as well as its sector. The average return on assets for companies in the same sector is 28.47.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whereas one analyst likes Snap’s potential to gear up as an advertising force among a strategic, young demographic, another analyst underscores slight cause for concern with Alphabet’s suddenly shaky tight rope walk amid global brand ad backlash. Let’s take a closer look:

Snap: The Platform Brands Need to Be Advertising On

Snap has divided many analysts on Wall Street since its IPO. Yet, William Blair analyst Ralph Schackart approaches the popular Snapchat app parent company with a bullish first impression, impressed with its “cool” factor among millennials, a bull’s eye from an advertising standpoint, as well as its robust social, video, and mobile ad budget growth prospects. As such, the analyst initiates coverage on SNAP with an Outperform rating without listing a price target.

As far as Schackart sizes up the new public company, “Snapchat Has What Brand Advertisers Want: Young Users,” elaborating, “By now, most advertisers we speak with know that Snapchat has a strong following among teenagers and millennials, who are becoming increasingly difficult to reach with TV advertisements. […] Given the importance of reaching this younger demographic, many brands see Snapchat as a platform they need to be advertising on.”

Considering that “Revenue [is] Just Beginning to Ramp Up, [with] Many Growth Drivers Ahead,” the analyst projects that by 2018, Snap could be circling $2 billion in revenue, indicating “a long runway for revenue growth” gleams ahead. “In the near term, we believe the largest contributors to revenue growth will be simply increasing the number of advertising clients and ads served,” continues the analyst.

Lastly, checking in with industry participants, Schackart highlights Snap’s competitive potential to steal digital ad dollars from rivals Facebook and Google for those seeking to attain a “viable third option.” With the company in solid standing to capture some of the worldwide TV ad market’s massive $186 billion share, the analyst concludes confidently cheering in Snap’s corner.

According to TipRanks, which measures analysts’ and bloggers’ success rate based on how their calls perform, four-star analyst Ralph Schackart is ranked #522 out of 4,555 analysts. Schackart has a 67% success rate and generates an average return of 12.3%. When recommending SNAP, Schackart earns 0.0% in average profits on the stock.

TipRanks analytics demonstrate SNAP as a Hold. Based on 31 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 12 rate a Buy on Snap, 12 maintain a Hold, while 7 issue a Sell on the stock. The 12-month average price target stands at $23.46, marking a nearly 2% downside from where the stock is currently trading.

Alphabet’s Glaring Global Ad Spend Pickle

Alphabet might have some brand image rehab on its hands from the eyes of Nomura analyst Anthony Diclemente, who after touching base with ad buyers has found some of the biggest spenders across the globe are tightening the reigns on YouTube ad spend. There is a rising apprehension from a brand advertising standpoint that brand reputation could be in jeopardy in the mix of appearing side-by-side “highly controversial content which is unsafe for brands.”

On the heels of YouTube ad campaign pullback, the analyst reiterates a Buy rating on shares of GOOGL while cutting the price target from $950 to $925, which represents a 10% increase from current levels. Furthermore, the analyst chops Google revenue and OI growth projections for the year.

Diclemente opines, “While we believe YouTube is indeed capable of introducing solutions that remedy brand safety concerns, we anticipate the direct cumulative negative impact to revenue could ultimately approximate $750mn, weighted heavily to 2Q17 and 3Q17. We also believe the cost of developing a solution may weigh on margins. Of course, investor confidence in YouTube’s ability to take incremental share of TV ad budgets has been reduced to some degree.”

Ultimately, “Checks with ad buyers highlight that when concerns over brand safety arise, approach is to ‘pull spend, ask questions later.’ Unfortunately, brand safety risk aversion from company CEO’s and CMO’s can go to extremes in well-publicized cases such as the current YouTube situation. […] ad buyers are likely to demand greater direct control over ad placement, which could take time and resources to implement, in our view,” Diclemente surmises.

As usual, we like to include the analyst’s track record when reporting on new analyst notes to give a perspective on the effect it has on stock performance. According to TipRanks, five-star analyst Anthony Diclemente is ranked #193 out of 4,555 analysts. Diclemente has a 71% success rate and realizes 11.6% in his annual returns.

Without the need for human intervention, it could cost-effectively offer ad space to advertisers with the click of a button (and payment, of course). This did wonders for GOOGL stock.

There does come a time, however, when a “hands off” approach to … well, pretty much everything can cause problems.

Alphabet stock holders were made well aware of that reality just last week when a couple of advertisers suspended their ad spending at YouTube when it was realized their advertisements prefaced some distasteful hate speech that surfaced at the popular online video venue.

In its defense, the company didn’t know. As was noted, ad placements are essentially automated. On the other hand, it’s arguable to say GOOGL should have known something like that could happen, and prevention measures should have been put in place. The debacle may force Alphabet to operate its advertising service with at least a little more human involvement.

A Big Mistake for GOOGL Stock?

Although several companies pulled the plug on their YouTube ads, AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T ) and Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ ) were a couple of the bigger names that called it quits … at least for the time being.

There was no specific event that prompted the boycotts, nor is it a brand new realization. But, the matter had been boiling over for a couple of weeks now, with an anti-Semitic clip video called “Jewish World Order” serving as the poster child of how vile the digital video venue can be, and how damning the power of association can be to a brand.

It’s theoretically not supposed to happen. Aside from the fact that ads are intended to be targeted to a plausible potential customer, but knowing that automated filters aren’t perfect, human judgment can also play a role in determining the appropriateness of an ad placement. Still, that’s clearly not working either.

Alphabet responded:

“We don’t comment on individual customers but as announced, we’ve begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear. We’re also raising the bar for our ads policies to further safeguard our advertisers’ brands.”

It’s the right thing to do, but a little too late.

Impact on Alphabet Stock

And it’s not just an embarrassing gaffe that will blow over, as most do. Nomura Instinet believes the advertiser boycott will shave $750 million off of the company’s top line over the course of the remainder of 2017.

That, however, isn’t much in the grand scheme of things.

YouTube was projected to drive $7.7 billion in revenue for that three-quarter stretch. Alphabet has done $90.3 billion in revenue for the last four quarters. Of course, inasmuch as YouTube isn’t profitable, the impact on the per-share profits of GOOGL stock may be nil.

The Other Greenhouse Gas

Most people are familiar with carbon dioxide (CO2) as a leading cause of global warming, but it isn’t the only one. Methane, while it doesn’t linger in the atmosphere as long as CO2 does, contributes its own fair share as a greenhouse gas. Methane is also more potent than CO2, and can remain in the atmosphere for roughly five years. Recent estimates put the amount of methane in the atmosphere at 1,834 parts per billion (ppb) while CO2 is at just 399.5 ppb.

One of the more common sources of methane is natural gas leaks. These leaks are now occurring at an increased rate, thanks to aging urban natural gas pipelines. In 2016, Los Angeles suffered the most disastrous natural gas leak in U.S. history when 100,000 tons of methane was released. Not only are these leaks hazardous for the environment, they also damage the natural gas industry. In Boston, for instance, about $90 million worth of natural gas is lost each year — roughly 3 percent of its supply.

More Than Just Maps

A team led by researchers from the Colorado State University (CSU), the Environmental Defense Fund, and Google Earth Outreach came up with a creative way of monitoring these leaks. They detail their project in a study published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology.

The team added pollution trackers to Google Earth’s Street View cars. The tracker uses an infrared laser that act as a methane analyzer, capable of identifying methane fumes in real time. Previously, this could only be done in labs using a gas chromatography analysis.

“The air contains gases that make it look foggy in the infrared spectrum,” explained Joe von Fischer from CSU. “The laser can scan through colors of infrared light and ‘see’ how much methane is present.” The researchers have tested the the device in Indianapolis, Boston, Staten Island, Syracuse, and Burlington, Vermont and Indianapolis.

“This is a huge challenge that almost nobody had been thinking about. Now we’re finding out just how widespread these leaks are,” said von Fischer. “The faster you fix them, the bigger the environmental benefits are. But utilities and regulators didn’t have the data to focus their efforts. […] Our goal is to make it faster, cheaper and easier to find and measure methane leaks from natural gas lines to help accelerate crucial repairs.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It seems a fair few people don't understand the rules of responsible disclosure. Researchers are perfectly free to go public by saying there is a flaw in a particular piece of code, so long as they don't say exactly what it is or how to exploit it before a patch is available.

There are some who suggest researchers shouldn't even highlight that a flaw exists. That ends up being counterproductive, since it reduces the incentive for manufacturers to fix their code. Companies might be fine with that, but it can put users at risk.

Google and others have 90-day disclosure rules for just this reason – the thinking is that if a company can't be bothered to sort out an issue in that time then they aren't really trying – although almost every researcher will give a manufacturer more time if needed.

Fresh on the heels of Facebook's header bidding endorsement, Google is moving to add dozens of technology partners and hundreds of publishers to the open beta of its header bidding alternative, called exchange bidding dynamic allocation, or EBDA.

Google is expected to start the open beta by early May, according to insiders with direct knowledge of the program. The company declined to say more about the timing other than that the open beta will begin ""in the coming months.""

Many in the ad tech industry feverishly support header bidding because it levels a playing field that's long been dominated by Google. Header bidding lets pools of buyers place simultaneous bids on ad inventory before Google's DoubleClick gets a shot.

Although header bidding has seen significant adoption by publishers, however, it still carries the reputation of a hacky workaround to DoubleClick. That changed last week after Facebook backed the tech, saying it would work with Index Exchange, Sonobi, Amazon, AppNexus, Sortable and Media.net to bring demand from its Audience Network to publishers using header bidding.

To put that in perspective, Facebook's endorsement was about as disruptive as an NFL team nabbing Tom Brady in free agency. It gave header bidding more legitimacy and customers while also applying significant pressure to Google and its DoubleClick empire.

How Google responds with its EBDA solution, and which tech compaines it adds to its roster (Google was notably missing from Facebook's list of partners), will have a significant impact on how marketers, publishers buy and sell digital ads and video.

Will Facebook and Amazon, another major power moving into header bidding, work with Google? Probably not. Is Google going to become more transparent to maintain its dominance? More than likely. And will there be any fees for ad tech companies or publishers? Nobody knows.

Jonathan Bellack, director of product management at Google, said the company has been very encouraged with results of its closed beta so far.

""Exchanges are building their businesses with improved inventory access, and new players are ramping up their buying or opening negotiations with us weekly,"" he said. ""We are profoundly excited about the potential of exchange bidding to help our publishers improve their yields and exchanges to grow their businesses, without compromising user experience.""

For nearly two decades Google has enjoyed a programmatic monopoly of sorts, working with nearly every publisher on the planet through its DoubleClick platform, which connects a firehose of ad budgets with publishers' available inventory.

It also benefits greatly from its Adx ad exchange, which lets Google cherry-pick the best inventory from the best publishers, often leaving rival ad-tech players at a severe disadvantage.

But header bidding has disrupted Google's hold on publishers by introducing a more transparent bidding process that can yield higher ad prices as well. Now Facebook will soon push a torrent of advertiser demand toward publishers that use header bidding, further sapping the inventory that Google gets to sell.

""Facebook has adopted a mantra, or code of conduct that they're willing to work with anyone that is transparent and open,"" said one high-level ad tech executive who asked to remain anonymous to protect industry relationships. ""I think that's basically a nice way of Facebook saying, 'We'll work with anyone that is not Google because Google is not transparent.""

Whether that changes under pressure remains to be seen.

""Google has had a kingdom that has been unchallenged for about 20 years, but now they're being aggressively challenged by giants like Amazon and Facebook,"" another ad-tech exec told Ad Age. ""Do they hold on to the end, or are they going to continue to open [EBDA] up and reduce potential gripes so their kingdom remains?""

""The answer to that question is a very likely yes, but they haven't publicly come out and explain why,"" the executive added.

There are a few things in this incident worth noting. The first is that Google’s not apologizing for it. Google says the job of its search engine is to present a wide variety of news and views (opinions).

Not necessarily the news

But even if you agree with that position, there's another problem that Google isn't addressing. And it's going to come up again and again.

On its face, “Top stories” certainly looks like a straightforward section where Google picks the top news articles on a given topic and presents them to you. (Until just a few months ago this separate carousel of links and images, which appears at the top of Google's desktop search results, was literally even called “In the news”).

But Google considers “Top stories” to be part of Google Search, which uses different criteria than Google News when choosing which articles to show readers. Web search results use broader standards to include news “and views,” and in this case, a Breitbart column that is definitely not a news report.

Now whether Google’s search engine should be ranking Breitbart's “views” about the Great Barrier Reef so high in any kind of web results is a separate debate. It's worth noting that Google has also repeatedly struggled with its web search engine promoting tons of conspiracy theories.

But leaving that issue aside, it’s clear that Google's “Top stories” section continues to be very confusing for users at a time when many are struggling to discern what's objective information from reputable sources. Google's confusing nomenclature is especially problematic because Google has an editorially-vetted news product called Google News, which is wildly popular and totally separate.

Secret ways

So then the next question is, would Breitbart show up as one of the top stories in Google News?

To be in Google News, publications first need to go through a human approval process to be labeled a legitimate news site. The first thing to note is, yes, Breitbart has been let onto the Google News platform. If you search for Breitbart in Google News, it’s there.

But even though Breitbart is on Google News, I personally haven’t noticed it showing up near the top of any of my Google News queries, nor have I seen any hand-wringing over that online. That doesn’t mean it hasn’t, however, or won’t in the future.

The inner workings of Google News, and how it ranks news sites, are kept secret by Google. But last month, Business Insider published a set of recollections of people who used to vet websites for Google News. Three separate people with direct knowledge of the process confirmed that, at least a few years back, there was a method to let publications onto Google News and then manually de-rank them so they wouldn’t show up prominently. This would happen if a site was considered, by the human reviewers, to be biased or untrustworthy, but technically fit the criteria of “news.” The site wouldn’t be informed that it had been internally flagged and lowered in Google's rankings.

Google has denied that such a process exists.

But it will be interesting to see, as time goes on, how prominently sites like Breitbart show up in Google News results, especially versus how they show up in Google Search, including the “Top Stories” section.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Last week, Google updated its ad policies and expanded safeguards for advertisers after some pulled advertising from YouTube because the video streaming site was displaying ads next to inappropriate content that espoused hate or even terrorism. Google said in a blog post that it has put in place more controls for advertisers, and it is also taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content.

Also: YouTube on defensive after new restrictions on some LGBTQ content

The potential impact of the increased scrutiny of ads and the backlash on YouTube, which is estimated to be about 15% to 20% of Alphabet’s GOOGL, +1.10% GOOG, +1.28% total revenue, is small when compared with the search giant’s total revenue, but not insubstantial. Analysts’ estimates on the drop in advertising spend range from about $750 million to about $1 billion in 2017.

“We estimate a [negative 1%] impact this year and next, assuming the problem is settled soon,” Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser said in a note to clients on Monday.

Google does not break out YouTube from Google’s other businesses, even though YouTube’s revenue is believed to rival that of Netflix Inc. NFLX, +0.90% and bring in as much as four times the revenue of Twitter Inc. TWTR, +0.67% . In 2017, according to J.P. Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth’s estimate, YouTube will represent roughly $10.5 billion in total revenue, or about 12% of Google’s gross ad revenue; Nomura Instinet analyst Anthony DiClemente lowered his 2017 revenue estimate for YouTube to $9.49 billion from $10.24 billion because of the ad-placement controversy.

Many analysts were quick to point out, though, that YouTube’s profit performance is a drop in the bucket as compared with that of the company, “perhaps no more than a few percent of total earnings,” Anmuth wrote Monday.

The very large, name-brand advertisers that have promised to drop YouTube ads could also be trying to negotiate better rates “during a time when advertisers and agencies are looking for negotiating leverage against an increasingly duopolistic digital ad community” dominated by Google and Facebook Inc. FB, +0.63% , UBS analyst Eric Sheridan wrote.

The names of advertisers that have pulled ads since the brouhaha started with an investigation by the Times of London is long, at about 250 companies, ranging from Verizon Communications Inc. VZ, -0.34% to L’Oréal SA OR, +0.62% to the Coca-Cola Co. KO, -0.02% . The Financial Times reported that advertisers are asking for discounts in pricing as a result.

The bigger fear for investors is that an advertiser backlash could spread from YouTube to Google’s overall search business, or cast a pall over YouTube’s planned “skinny bundle” service. Since the story broke, Alphabet shares have fallen nearly 4%.

Google’s efforts to handle the situation are getting mixed reviews from investors who see cause for concern.

“Their public statements do not suggest to us that the company appreciates the degree to which advertisers are concerned and the continuing announcements of advertisers suspending their activity on Google properties reinforces our view,” Pivotal analyst Wieser wrote.

Trip Chowdhry, an analyst with Global Equities Research, predicted that Google will need to give out ad credits to lure back advertisers, which would also impact YouTube revenue.

Don’t miss: This is what happens on the internet in just one minute

The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that the YouTube service was still rife with examples of ads running alongside offensive videos. Because the ads are automated, meaning they are placed using algorithms without human intervention, the advertisers also appear to need to be more involved in placing the ads themselves. Google said it is “changing the default settings for ads so that they show on content that meets a higher level of brand safety and exchanges potentially objectionable content.”

Google has managed to handle such controversies in the past, and, alongside Facebook FB, +0.63% , has a dominant position in the online advertising industry. Investors who want to feel secure in that knowledge certainly have reason.

“Don’t panic yet,” wrote Robert W. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian, in a note to clients on Monday.

Panic is unnecessary, but investors will want to carry this knowledge with them into the next few Alphabet earnings reports. While Google will likely continue to mask YouTube’s true performance from its investors, any slippage in the growth rate of advertising revenue should be cause for alarm.

(RTTNews.com) - The British government has started putting pressure on Facebook to allow government agencies access to Whatsapp messages in order to counter terrorism.

In a Sunday appearance on BBC'sAndrew Marr show, U.K. Secretary of State Amber Rudd said the end-to-end encryption capabilities of messaging tools like WhatsApp are ""completely unacceptable.""

According to a report published on the Daily Mail last week, Khalid Masood was active on Whatsapp just two minutes before he attacked London that killed four people.

""We need to make sure that organizations like WhatsApp don't provide a secret place for terrorists to communicate with one another,"" Rudd said on the BBC'sAndrew Marr Show on Sunday. ""It used to be that people would steam open envelopes or just listen in on phones [...] but in this situation we need to make sure our intelligence services have the ability to get into situations like encrypted WhatsApp.""

The fight between governments and tech companies have been going around for a couple of years. In 2015, the US government demanded Apple to de-encrypt an iPhone belonging to one of the shooters of the San Bernardino attack. The government even filed a lawsuit against the iPhone maker. In Brazil, Whatsapp executives have been arrested as well the service has been blocked several times for not cooperate with police investigations.

The Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) company is expected to generate $5.2 billion in U.S. display advertising this year.

But Facebook's ad revenue is largely confined to its own properties, such as Facebook and Instagram. The Facebook Audience Network (FAN) -- its ad network -- generates only a few hundred million in annual net ad revenue for the company. That number could get a significant boost in the near term, as Facebook just announced it's rolling out header bidding to all mobile web publishers. That represents not only a significant opportunity for Facebook to increase its network ad revenue, but a threat to Google's display ad business as well.

Publishers love header bidding

Header bidding is a system that levels the playing field when it comes to selling ads online. Previously, whenever you loaded a web page, that publisher would check ad networks one by one until it found an advertiser willing to pay a reasonable price to populate the ads on the site. Since Google is such a dominant force in advertising, publishers' searches usually started and ended with Google.

Header bidding allows publishers to collect bids from multiple ad networks at the same time and receive the highest bid for its ad inventory. As a result, publishers receive more revenue for their ads, and smaller ad networks stand a fighting chance against Google. The more ad networks supporting header bidding, the better it is for publishers. Facebook says publishers in its tests saw a revenue increase of 10% to 30%.

Image source: Facebook

Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) notably developed a header bidding solution last year in an effort to potentially grow its advertising business . Given Amazon's prowess in cloud computing -- supporting hundreds of major websites -- its integrated cloud-based solution could prove extremely popular with publishers. Now, Facebook is partnering with Amazon and several other header-bidding system developers to bring its ad network to more publishers.

Growing the ad network

Facebook's audience network still represents a small part of Facebook's revenue. It reached a $1 billion run rate at the beginning of 2016, but that's gross revenue. Facebook only keeps a small percentage of that figure as net revenue.

During Facebook's second-quarter earnings call last year, CFO Dave Wehner told analysts: ""The overall growth is still being driven predominantly by Facebook. Instagram is clearly making a contribution, as is the Audience Network.""

That may change later this year, however, as Facebook faces ad load saturation. But with the social network's steady user growth and continued increases in engagement, Facebook's enormousness will still be tough to overshadow.

Nonetheless, the growth of FAN will certainly help Facebook offset some of the slowdown at its flagship app. In fact, since the audience network uses the same targeting data as Facebook's in-house ads, Facebook advertisers may be inclined to start buying more ads on Facebook, especially if header bidding increases its ability to win bids on publishers' websites.

FAN represents an opportunity for marketers to reach Facebook's audience outside Facebook and even expand beyond Facebook. Management says FAN offers 16% greater reach than Facebook alone and now reaches 1 billion people monthly.

The impact on Google

The value of FAN to publishers is that Facebook requires marketers to bid the same on FAN ads as on its own ads. Therefore, third-party publishers get the same (presumably high) rates as Facebook. If Facebook's average bid is higher than Google's, it could force Google to lower its take rate from publishers.

Last year, Google generated $15.6 billion in gross revenue from its network partners. It also paid out $10.9 billion in revenue sharing to those publishers, about 70%. In fact, publishers' revenue share from Google has increased two percentage points since 2014, when header bidding started becoming popular.

Google said that ""the increase in Network Members' TAC [traffic acquisition cost] rate was primarily driven by the shift in advertising buying from our traditional network business to programmatic advertising buying."" As more ad sales shift to header bidding and more ad networks like Facebook join the fray, Google stands to see that number continue climbing, unless it wants to lose out on some of that $15.6 billion in gross revenue it generated last year.

(RTTNews.com) - Four major tech companies are reportedly bidding for the streaming rights of NFL's ""Thursday Night Football"" games next season.

According to a report by tech blog Recode, citing several unnamed sources, Twitter, Amazon, Facebook and YouTube are all bidding for the rights to stream 10 NFL games. Last season, Twitter paid $10 million for the same rights.

Although, its not clear how much the winning bidder will have to pay this year, it's likely to be far less than the $450 millionCBS Corp. and NBCUniversal are collectively paying to broadcast the same 10 games.

Twitter had claimed that around 3.5 million people watched each game, on average.

And for investors who have worried about so-called “peak-Apple” given that shares are up some 21% in three months, Apple stock is positioned to keep climbing on the assumption that the company is becoming less reliant on the success of the iPhone — which, by the way, continues to put up solid numbers after a slight dip a year ago.

First reported by TechCrunch, Apple on Thursday acquired Workflow, an app that automates frequently performed actions on its devices. Only three years old, Workflow founders and investors received what TechCrunch called ""a solid payday.” We don’t know what that means given that terms of the deal were not disclosed. However, what we do know is that Workflow, whose motto is ""spend less taps, get more done,” is one of the most-popular apps on Apple’s App Store.

For only $2.99, Workflow connects apps and functions that allows users to automate the things they do most often on their Apple devices. For example, by generating shortcuts and placing the corresponding icons on their home screen, users can request an Uber just from a single tap, using a preset location. Likewise, with one tap, Workflow users can receive the top news stories from the day or order a Starbucks (SBUX) latte without opening the Starbucks app.

There are several reasons why Apple bought Workflow, which awarded Workflow with an Apple Design award at its annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in 2015. Workflow, which is also available on Apple Watch, has been praised by Apple for features such as VoiceOver and and drag/drop. But given the rapid rise and dominance of Amazon’s (AMZN) home speaker, combined with Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google Home, Apple can now integrate Workflow with its voice-activated assistant Siri.

Likewise, Apple CEO Tim Cook has shown tons of interest in the realm of artificial intelligence (AI). Workflow’s ability to make different apps talk to each other could be the missing piece Apple has been seeking to fully immerse itself into HomeKit. And the fact that Apple has already made Workflow free on Apple devices, removing the previous $2.99 price, suggests Apple is serious about ramping up the number of people who uses the app.

All told, this move also underscores the extent to which Apple is aggressively looking to grow its Services segment, which accounted for 9.2% of total revenue in the first quarter. Based on Friday’s closing price of $140.64, AAPL stock is priced at 16 times fiscal 2017 estimates of $8.94 per share, compared to 18 P/E for the S&P 500 index. Workflow’s acquisitions and others that may follow keeps Apple stock on track to reach $160 by the end of the year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With all the hype, investors may be asking themselves: What's the best way to invest in this growing trend?

Let's look at three companies with solid artificial-intelligence programs: e-commerce titan Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) , Google search parent Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) , and cognitive-computing leader International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE: IBM) .

Amazon.com

Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos believes that AI could be the fourth pillar of the company's business, behind its e-commerce, its cloud hosting unit Amazon Web Services (AWS), and its Prime membership program. Alexa, the company's virtual assistant and AI poster child, hosts a variety of products that leverage her AI foundation, including the Echo smart-home speaker , the smaller Dot, and the portable Tap, as well as the Fire tablet and Fire TV Stick. Using natural-language processing and cloud computing, these products respond to voice commands, and AI allows Alexa to learn continuously the more the products are used. Developers have created more than 10,000 ""skills"" that provide a variety of functionality, from ordering pizza to scheduling a ride-share.

Amazon has also been leveraging its deep-learning innovations by deploying them across AWS as managed services available to its customers. Lex, similar to Alexa, can build sophisticated chatbots; Rekognition provides image-recognition capabilities; and Polly reads and recites text. Amazon grew its revenue to $46 billion in its most recent quarter, so its AI contribution is currently microscopic, but that could change. RBC Capital Markets predicts that Alexa could contribute an additional $10 billion annually by 2020.

Google

Google has been investing heavily for years in a sub-discipline of AI called deep learning , and the result of that research is an artificial neural network, christened the Google Brain. By combining massive amounts of data with complicated algorithms, the system recognizes patterns and learns in a way similar to the human brain. The company has infused the knowledge gained into a vast array of its businesses, using AI to improve the reliability of its ubiquitous search, decrease the energy consumption of its servers, and catalog images from its Street View mapping cars.

Its AI-powered Google Assistant, the company's entry in the growing list of virtual personal assistants , is available in many of the company's branded devices and is the foundation for its Google Home smart speaker system. Google Assistant interacts with the company's Photos, Maps, Keep, Calendar, and other services, provides the ability to stream music and movies to Android mobile devices, and controls home-automation products. Google is also a well-known pioneer in the area of AI-based autonomous driving.

With $26 billion in revenue for the most recent quarter, Alphabet will notice little effect from Home just yet; this is a new product, so we don't have data for how popular it is, but the potential market is huge. Activate.com estimates that smart speakers will be in 21 million homes by 2020.

IBM

IBM's Watson might be best remembered for its winning stint on the popular TV game show Jeopardy! , but Watson hasn't been resting on its laurels. You won't see consumer-facing products coming from Big Blue, but the company has developed a wide variety of business partnerships using the abilities of its cognitive AI supercomputer. Watson's earliest foray was into the field of healthcare, where it has been tasked with cancer research, immunotherapy, diabetes management, and genomic sequencing. Most notably, Watson was recently able to correctly diagnose cancer patients, agreeing with oncologists in 99% of cases. The cognitive computer also successfully diagnosed a rare form of leukemia in a case that had baffled doctors -- all within 10 minutes after being fed the data.

Watson has partnered in other fields, improving the accuracy of tax returns , providing cybersecurity , and improving regulatory compliance for financial institutions. Watson is a bet on AI-based cognitive computing, data analytics, and cloud computing, as the company moves away from its legacy hardware and IT services business. IBM has yet to disclose Watson's contribution, but ""strategic imperatives,"" where Watson's revenue is reported, grew 13% in 2016 to account for 41% of total revenue.

Foolish final thoughts

These companies are at the forefront of the AI revolution, but AI innovations represent only a portion of their total business. Investors should avoid investing in any of these companies based solely on the advantages represented by AI.

That said, if you like any of these companies and are interested in adding AI to your portfolio, each offers that opportunity. While it may be difficult to quantify many of the benefits, we do know that AI can help increase revenue and efficiency, provide a compelling and productive ecosystem to consumers, and provide new opportunities for business.

Competition has the tendency to drive down profits, but a great business can buck this trend. A competitive advantage isn't enough; the best businesses have durable competitive advantages, what Warren Buffett calls an economic moat. Trying to beat a company with a moat isn't impossible, but it's often not worth the cost.

We asked three of our contributors to each discuss a company that fits the above description. Here's why Mastercard (NYSE: MA) , Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , and Waste Management (NYSE: WM) are three of the best businesses, and the best stocks, we've ever seen.

A toll bridge on global commerce

Brian Feroldi (Mastercard): While there are a lot of great business models in existence, I must admit that Mastercard's is the one I most admire. Mastercard plays a crucial role in connecting merchants, customers, and financial institutions together to enable digital commerce. In exchange for its services, Mastercard takes a small swipe off of each transaction. With trillions of dollars flowing through its network each year -- yes, trillions -- those small fees add up to the tune of more than $10 billion in annual revenue.

All that revenue is wonderful, but what I really love about Mastercard's business is its operating leverage. In essence, this means that Mastercard's costs are largely fixed, so processing one more transaction costs the company next to nothing. Thus, every additional transaction that the company can incentivize on its network almost turns into pure profit. Since consumers have been ditching cash and checks in favor of credit and debit cards for years, Mastercard's profit margin has skyrocketed.

MA Profit Margin (TTM) data by YCharts .

Looking ahead, I see no reason for this trend to change. While credit and debit cards are ubiquitous in developed markets, they only represent 15% of global transactions. That suggests that this company has decades of room left for revenue and profit growth. If true, then Mastercard's stock stands a good chance at continuing to thump the market from here. That's why I've made this company one of my biggest personal holdings and have no intention to sell my shares anytime soon.

An incredible technology company

Tim Green (Alphabet): The amount of cash that Alphabet's Google throws off is made even more impressive by the fact that the company is still growing at a double-digit rate. Revenue from Google grew by 20% in 2016 to $89.5 billion, with the business producing operating income of $27.9 billion. While Google does face threats, ranging from social media companies like Facebook to e-commerce giant Amazon , the company's products are so deeply embedded in people's lives that upending its business model would be a herculean task.

Google dominates search, leaving its competitors fighting over the scraps. Products like Gmail, Maps, and the Chrome browser have become the standards, giving Google a massive base of users. Google's Android mobile operating system powers more than 85% of all smartphones sold, and its Chromebooks now account for more than half of all U.S. classroom devices sold. All of this feeds into it advertising business and its cloud computing business.

The success of Google allows Alphabet to subsidize its moon shots. From self-driving cars to internet access delivered via balloons, Alphabet is betting billions that one of these long-shot ideas will take off. Many will lead nowhere, but the potential of each idea is enormous.

Alphabet is one of the most successful companies in history, and that success has been sustained by significant competitive advantages. Even if none of Alphabet's moonshots pay off, the company should continue to thrive well into the future.

The best kind of business: The ones you use daily but never even consider



Tyler Crowe (Waste Management): I think of some of the best businesses to be in are the ones that we don't consider on a daily basis. Those day-to-day tasks we take for granted and think nothing of paying for the service. Is there anything that fits that description better than handling our refuse? Companies that collect and properly dispose of our trash are incredibly valuable services that we barely notice. Behind the scenes, though, it is a business that has more competitive advantages than one can count. That's what makes Waste Management the kind of company that leaves me in awe of its business model.

The most obvious advantage a waste handling industry has is geography and regulations. The ability to open up a new landfill for proper waste disposal faces mountains of regulatory scrutiny as well as the ""not in my backyard"" mentality of local communities. So those companies that can get a landfill up and running have near-monopolistic reign over a particular region. If that weren't enough, it's extremely capital intense to build and maintain a fleet of collection vehicles. These types of strategic benefits keep competition low in specific regions and give those operating in a particular community incredible pricing power.

For investors in Waste Management, it has translated this economic moat into a value-generating machine. While no one will ever be blown away with the company's growth rates, it continues to generate gobs of free cash flow that is used to buy back stock and increase dividend payments. These sorts of shareholder-friendly initiatives have made Waste Management an incredible stock to hold for decades at a time.

It's hard to disrupt a well-entrenched business in the waste-handling industry, and that makes Waste Management a stock that should tug at the heartstrings of long-term investors.

(NASDAQ: BIDU) has made a name for itself as one of the leaders in artificial intelligence (AI) in the world's most populous country. It has made no secret about its excitement regarding the prospects for the technology and has hired some of the foremost experts in the field for high level positions within the company. Now, it is getting the Chinese government seal of approval for its trouble.

The government agency in China responsible for planning economic and social strategies will provide an undisclosed amount of funding to Baidu to develop a national laboratory committed to deep learning, a specific discipline of AI. The ""lab"" will not be a physical structure, but an online network of interconnected researchers sharing data. Baidu will be joined by Tsinghua and Beihang Universities and other academics from the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The lab's initial focus will be in the areas of computer vision, biometric identification, and human-computer interaction.

AI is the new electricity

Baidu's CEO, Robin Li has been outspoken regarding his belief regarding the potential of AI . At the Baidu World Conference in 2016, he stated ""gone is the era of PC, and soon will we say goodbye to the era of mobile internet...We believe that coming is the era of artificial intelligence, which to us is the Baidu Brain.""

The Baidu Brain is an AI-based artificial neural network that sorts through reams of data and can detect patterns. Baidu's chief scientist Andrew Ng was a founding member of the team that developed the Google Brain prior to his tenure at Baidu. He is also an adjunct professor at Stanford University, where he taught AI and has made similar statements concerning his belief that AI will be transformational:

I think that AI is a new superpower. AI is the new electricity. Two hundred years ago there was no such thing as electricity. You couldn't talk on phones, there was no electric lighting, you couldn't have a refrigerator. About 100 years ago as we started to build out electricity we saw that transformed not just one industry but industry after industry. We think that AI will similarly transform industry to industry. In that sense it is a superpower.

This neural network and others like it have led to far-reaching developments in image recognition, natural language processing, voice recognition, and user profiling. These in turn have led to the development of virtual assistants that reside on most smartphones, smart home speaker systems , advances in medical research , and even tools for cybersecurity .

Governments worldwide waking up to the potential of AI

China isn't the only country considering the future of AI. A White House report issued in late December titled Artificial Intelligence, Automation, and the Economy that sought to determine the ""ways that artificial intelligence will transform our economy over the coming years and decades."" The initial report , Preparing for the Future of Artificial Intelligence , revealed that the US government was spending $1.2 billion on AI research last year and recommended tripling that amount.

Last year, DeepMind, a division of Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google revealed that its AlphaGo AI system defeated South Korea's top ranked player at Go, an ancient Chinese game whose complexity had stymied previous computer attempts to master. South Korea subsequently announced a plan to invest $863 million in AI research over the coming five years. The UK has also announced its intention to invest 20 million pounds in the areas of robotics and AI.

Foolish final thoughts

This may be the beginning of a new era of government backing for AI. Boston Consulting Group estimates that AI will generate between $100 billion and $120 billion in productivity gains by 2025. Just as big tech companies are racing to stake their claim in this transformational science, so are governments afraid of being left behind.

The bump from the Chinese government couldn't come at a better time for Baidu -- the company has been struggling to re-energize its slowing growth and has been counting on AI to provide the catalyst. Online marketing, which represents more than 91% of the company's revenue, has fallen 8.2% and 6.7% year-over-year respectively, in its two most recent quarters, and the customers base that produces that revenue have fallen 18.6% and 15.9%. In the last year, the company has spent 14% of its total revenue on research and development expenses, and the majority of that has been on AI.

The company is banking on AI to reverse course, and now it has some extra backing to do so.

These are the trends we’ve been tracking and how we feel they should be played in the current environment. The best way to gauge the future price movement of a stock is to look at historical chart data and map a course for the future. Gathering this data is best done by combing through the technical data and a mix of indicators.

Recent trading for (GOOG) has highlighted key trends upon which sound decisions can be based. The levels established for its relative 50 and 200 SMAs have suggested that the current trend is bullish. The current trend established by the SMAs also highlight the level of investor interest as the stock makes its way across varying levels of risk and upside potential. This has further created a general positive trading atmosphere. Current trends have also fed into volume levels which have seen weak buying and selling sentiments, reflecting the general indifference of interested parties across the broadest trading and investing spectrum. Combined these sentiment-based indicators and trends point to potential deeper impacts on cross-related technical factors capable of influencing overall upside.

The deeper test for the directional thrust of a stock is measured through two very important indicators: Relative strength indicator (RSI) and Stochastic measures. Both indicators offer up the distilled wisdom of whether the stock is oversold or overbought, i.e. are the sellers dominating activities, or are the buyers doping the bulk of the movement. For (GOOG) the 14-day RSI is 36.47% this indicates that on the balance of traditional RSI measures, the stock is neutral – neither overbought nor oversold and therefore not susceptible to any undue price movements in either direction. The stochastic picture offers up another powerful indicator of potential price movement for (GOOG). Stochastic data amassed over the past 30 days highlights a score of 17.84%. This indicates that the stock is oversold at current levels.

Leading indicators, good as they are in predicting and signaling price movement, may not tell the whole story. When they fall short it is up to other types of indicators to help pick up the slack. Short-term movement for (GOOG) has offered up some interesting dynamics. Its -14.21 price change has produced negative change over the past 30 days. Longer term the stock has underperform the S&P 500 by -4.4%. This performance has come on the back of consistently lower daily volatility when matched against other stocks trading on the same exchange. Recent momentum has been largely informed by a historical volatility of 11.81%. This level of volatility is indicative of the speed (rate of change) of the underlying stock price and is therefore a helpful gauge at a glance. The risk-implied volatility is also being showcased via the average true range, currently 1.1. Keep in mind that ATR does not account for price direction therefore professional traders always utilize the price chart in tandem with the ATR indicator.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3/27/2017,0.342138511,0.02275641,806.95,821.63,803.37,819.51,1894990,18.26,12.56,1,"We have gathered the technical data on Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), and see some interesting trends in the stock’s behavior of late. They say the “soul” of a stock is best known by an examination of its behavior on the tape. With that in mind, consider how this stock has been acting as a clue to where it may be headed going forward.

GOOGL has been trading in a bearish trend, based on the relative levels of its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages. This suggests that the broad sum of capital flow in the stock has been generally negative over the recent period. In terms of the relative level of interest afforded this stock among active participants in the market, relative volume measures have been weak, indicating apathy for the name by traders, investors, and money managers during the past month of action. This suggests something of the significance of other current technical measures as well.

For market timers, it’s also important to take measure of the relative level of recent lift or pressure in the stock is it overbought or oversold? For that, we turn to RSI and stochastic measures. The 14-day RSI stands at 37.15%. That shows that the stock, according to a traditional interpretation and usage of the RSI indicator, is not particularly predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure If we look at the stochastic measure, the raw data over the stock’s last month of action shows a score of 18.45%. Based on a raw data interpretation, this perspective doesn’t suggest either an overbought or oversold condition.

Sometimes, there is information carried in simply the degree of movement in a stock. In recent action, GOOGL has made a move of -12.67 over the past month. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by -4.52%, and it’s gotten there by action that has been less volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. The stock’s recent movement has come on a historical volatility score of 11.34%, which represents the standard deviation of returns of a theoretical long position from a mean price during that period. On a daily basis over the past month, the average true range of the stock, as expressed in percentage terms, is 1.1%. That should give you a pretty good sense of the level of risk implied in a short-term trading approach in the stock with a stop-loss in place.

As it stands at present, the stock might find important action at key Fibonacci levels. Fibonacci levels are used by major Wall Street firm technical desks. The math is drawn from the Fibonacci series that defines growth systems by an interval increase characterized by steps divisible by the “golden ratio” of 61.8%. In this case, the critical 38.2% level drawn off the 52-weeklow of $672.66 sits at $749.73. GOOGL also has additional support below at the stock’s 200-day simple moving average, which sits at $798.76.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The stock has lost about $40 per share from the all-time high as advertisers flee the platform. Should investors snap up the stock on this sell off or wait for a bigger dip?

The Wall Street Journal detailed on Friday afternoon how the issue at YouTube was not improving. A journalist was able to detail that brand ads were played on up to 20 videos deemed highly offensive and even racist causing more brands to pull ads.

RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney estimated that YouTube was on pace to generate $18.8 billion in ad revenues this year. The amount is less than 20% of the $106.3 billion forecast for the whole company.

His original forecast of a $300 million revenue impact probably wasn't a problem for the stock, but the follow up forecast of a $1 billion hit is problematic. Whether or not one expects YouTube to solve the problem soon doesn't change the mindset of the market to shoot first and spend a lot of time asking questions.

Ultimately though, advertisers need the teen audience of YouTube. A eMarketer graph highlights how the teen audience up to 17 years old is highly focused on Google properties with YouTube being the prime website for teen users.

Remember that this crowd is highly valued and the prime reason that Snap (NYSE:SNAP) recently went public with a market valuation that tops $30 billion. The primary service of Snapchat doesn't even match the reach of YouTube and hasn't grown much since this poll was conducted at the end of September.

This issue with ads showing on objectionable videos doesn't alter the viewership though. People watching those videos will continue watching them and the desirable teen audience wasn't likely watching those videos anyway. YouTube just needs to steer the ads for the likes of Pepsi (NYSE:PEP) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) to the kid friendly content.

The process seems simple enough to solve. Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt claims problems exist with the algorithm technology accurately flagging some racist videos, but YouTube should be able to implement a brand friendly category for content creators. Basically, if content creators want the big ad dollars, you must qualify and abide by basic guidelines. The company can run the software against new video uploads and require an editor review those flagged. Anybody failing to abide by the rules in the program has ads blocked.

One can easily predict the outcome here. YouTube solves the problem and brands find advertising on the platform even more compelling than before. Until then, situations that get worse on second review tend to have lasting impacts. Not to mention, some of the statements by Eric Schmidt seem to suggest Google is too interested in lowering the ranking of the videos versus blocking ads on them that really don't solve the concerns of the brand advertisers.

A $1 billion hit to revenues over the next couple of quarters while Alphabet solves this problem is meaningful. A $500 million hit to Q2 revenues reduces the growth rate to 15.8%. Revenues are targeted at $25.4 billion now, up from $21.5 billion last year. Each $500 million hit reduces the growth rate by 230 basis points so one can quickly see on the growth rate quickly unravels.

The key investor takeaway is that Alphabet via YouTube controls the much wanted access to teens. The company will ultimately work with brand advertisers to find a workable solution, though some signs exist that a disconnect exists.

The stock will struggle in the meantime, but this issue doesn't ultimately change the path to $1,000. Don't get too negative on Alphabet, but an opportunity to own the stock might exist down at $800 for those that don't own the stock yet.

3/24/2017,0.439551639,0.011506648,820.08,821.93,808.89,814.43,1981006,13.04,-5.65,0,"Updated Google's Chrome development team has posted a stinging criticism of Symantec's certificate-issuance practices, saying it has lost confidence in the company's practices and therefore in the safety of sessions hopefully-secured by Symantec-issued certificates.

Google's post says “Since January 19, the Google Chrome team has been investigating a series of failures by Symantec Corporation to properly validate certificates. Over the course of this investigation, the explanations provided by Symantec have revealed a continually increasing scope of misissuance with each set of questions from members of the Google Chrome team; an initial set of reportedly 127 certificates has expanded to include at least 30,000 certificates, issued over a period spanning several years.”

Googler Ryan Sleevi unloads on Symantec as follows:

Symantec allowed at least four parties access to their infrastructure in a way to cause certificate issuance, did not sufficiently oversee these capabilities as required and expected, and when presented with evidence of these organizations’ failure to abide to the appropriate standard of care, failed to disclose such information in a timely manner or to identify the significance of the issues reported to them. These issues, and the corresponding failure of appropriate oversight, spanned a period of several years, and were trivially identifiable from the information publicly available or that Symantec shared.

The post gets worse, for Symantec:

The full disclosure of these issues has taken more than a month. Symantec has failed to provide timely updates to the community regarding these issues. Despite having knowledge of these issues, Symantec has repeatedly failed to proactively disclose them. Further, even after issues have become public, Symantec failed to provide the information that the community required to assess the significance of these issues until they had been specifically questioned. The proposed remediation steps offered by Symantec have involved relying on known-problematic information or using practices insufficient to provide the level of assurance required under the Baseline Requirements and expected by the Chrome Root CA Policy.

The upshot is that Google feels it can “no longer have confidence in the certificate issuance policies and practices of Symantec over the past several years” and it therefore proposes three remedies:

A reduction in the accepted validity period of newly issued Symantec-issued certificates to nine months or less, in order to minimize any impact to Google Chrome users from any further misissuances that may arise.

An incremental distrust, spanning a series of Google Chrome releases, of all currently-trusted Symantec-issued certificates, requiring they be revalidated and replaced.

Removal of recognition of the Extended Validation status of Symantec issued certificates, until such a time as the community can be assured in the policies and practices of Symantec, but no sooner than one year.

What do we mean by Extended Validation? It's a little feature that allows the browser to confidently show the owner of a HTTPS-secured website next to the green padlock in the address bar. Google Chrome is going to stop showing that text string for Symantec-issued SSL/TLS certificates. In other words, websites that have paid Symantec for certs with Extended Validation won't see the feature in Chrome.

A normal certificate without the Extended Validation string

A certificate with its Extended Validation text shown in the browser

As for the ""reduction in the accepted validity period,"" that means various different versions of Chrome will stop trusting Symantec-issued certificates older than the times listed below. Once a Symantec-issued cert is older than the validity period listed, Chrome will stop trusting it, forcing the certificate's owner to renew it.

Chrome version Cert validity period Chrome 59 (Dev, Beta, Stable) 33 months (1023 days) Chrome 60 (Dev, Beta, Stable) 27 months (837 days) Chrome 61 (Dev, Beta, Stable) 21 months (651 days) Chrome 62 (Dev, Beta, Stable) 15 months (465 days) Chrome 63 (Dev, Beta) 9 months (279 days) Chrome 63 (Stable) 15 months (465 days) Chrome 64 (Dev, Beta, Stable) 9 months (279 days)

""We propose to require that all newly-issued certificates must have validity periods of no greater than 9 months (279 days) in order to be trusted in Google Chrome, effective Chrome 61,"" the search giant added.

""This ensures that the risk of any further misissuance is, at most, limited to nine months, and more importantly, that if any further action is warranted or necessary, that the entire ecosystem can migrate within that time period, thus minimizing the risk of further compatibility issues.""

Google reckons this plan will mean “web developers are aware of the risk and potential of future distrust of Symantec-issued certificates, should additional misissuance events occur, while also allowing them the flexibility to continue using such certificates should it be necessary.”

And of course it also gives developers time to arrange new certificates from whatever issuer pleases them most. Symantec has told The Register it is developing a response to Google's allegations. We will add it to this story as soon as we receive it. ®

Updated to add

Symantec has hit back at Google's claims, saying they are “exaggerated and misleading.”

“We strongly object to the action Google has taken to target Symantec SSL/TLS certificates in the Chrome browser,” Symantec said in a blog post.

“This action was unexpected, and we believe the blog post was irresponsible. We hope it was not calculated to create uncertainty and doubt within the Internet community about our SSL/TLS certificates.”

The company said that while yes, it had mis-issued 127 certificates, that 30,000 figure was “not true,” and no consumer harm had been done. It claims to operate “in accordance with industry standards,” and will defend its reputation. Symantec is now in discussions with Google to resolve the issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the outfit is notoriously cagey about its work, it's certainly not shy about striking up partnerships.

The latest one came on Thursday afternoon, when the biotech C4 Therapeutics announced a five-year research collaboration with Calico to develop drugs for ""diseases of aging,"" including cancer.

There's not a whole lot in the way of details. The firms will ""leverage C4T’s expertise and capabilities in targeted protein degradation to jointly discover and advance small molecule protein degraders as therapeutic agents to remove certain disease-causing proteins,"" according to a press release. In simpler terms, the firms wants to create medicines to sniff out proteins that may help cause cancers and destroy them.

""We know from decades of translational research that it can be incredibly challenging to find effective pharmacologic inhibitors of many of the biologically well-validated targets, particularly in cancer,"" said Hal Barron, R&D chief over at Calico, in a statement. ""Through the alternative strategy of specifically targeting such proteins for degradation, we believe we have the opportunity to identify promising new therapeutics in cancer and in other diseases as well.""

Beyond that, we know very little, including what other disease targets or specific cancers will be Calico's and C4T's focus as they pursue preclinical experimental molecules. Calico has previously struck partnerships with academic institutes like the University of California, San Francisco and biopharma companies such as AbbVie .

Starting in June, Google is saying good-bye to one of its most beloved products, Gchat. Officially, the chat app’s name was Google Talk; Gchat was just what hip, personal-computer owners started calling it back in the day, but the name has persisted. While the functionality of Gchat isn’t really going away — users will be rolled over to Hangouts, a Google chat platform that has been up and running for four years at this point and does effectively the same thing — the name and user interface will be no more.



Gchat’s run as the king of adult instant-messaging started back in 2005. For those of us just getting into the web around then, it was a perfect platform: Your tech-inept parents weren’t on it yet. It was cleaner and easier to use than AIM. And there was the added bonus that because it was new — Gmail launched in 2004, a year prior to Gchat — you might actually be able to snag a variation on your name, if not your given name exactly. Realistically, you probably went with something much cooler and more true to your inner spirit, like “flypegasusfly,” “crewgirl16,” or “mormonboy12804.” (I wish I could say I made any of those up.)

Sure, when the Google Hangouts switch happens in June, your online interactions aren’t really going to change that much. But the name will die, and that’s something to grieve on this slow-for-tech-news Friday. To Gchat with somebody was to enter a secret sanctum, one with an off-the-record-mode-induced cone of silence, which erased messages after you sent them. Giving somebody your personal Gmail account to message was an offering of friendship, an invitation to gossip freely away from the potentially prying eyes of company-owned Slack channels and Campfire rooms. If somebody wanted to Gchat, you knew to expect some good dish about your boss, or your ex, or your boss’s ex.

In addition to Google Hangouts, Google still offers a handful of other communication apps, including Allo, Duo, and its Android messaging app. Still, none of those have quite the same ring as “take this to Gchat.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3/24/2017,0.389240347,0.148834394,820.08,821.93,808.89,814.43,1981006,13.04,-5.65,0,"While Google continues to add more features to its two social communication apps Allo and Duo, TechCrunch has learned that it has quietly been working on least one more social app. Google has been developing a new social app that lets small groups edit photos together and then organise them for future enjoyment: think Path meets Snapchat-style filters and edits meets Google’s imaging smarts.

Google confirmed the existence of the app after we asked about it, and told us that (for now) is an experiment, one of many it’s running.

But it sounds like Google may be downplaying this a bit. According to our sources, one plan had been to launch the app during its I/O event in May — much as it did last year with Duo and Allo — although from what we understand right now there is no specific date set.

Could the announcement this week of Clips from Apple, a video editing app that will also use AI, image recognition and speech recognition, also have played a part in deciding timing?

We also don’t know what name Google is planning for it, but here is what we do know.

The approach the developers are taking is not to make “yet another messaging app” but more of a collaborative social photo app. Users can create groups for sharing pictures. And then group members would all be able to edit and tag the same pictures.

Alongside this, Google would apply some of its own computer vision expertise and technology — currently used across services like YouTube, Google’s image search, and Google Photos — to help users along: it will be able to identify objects in a photo to tag them and organise them and in the future search for them, as well as to help edit and apply filters to the pictures.

We think some of the photo features in the app sound a lot like Clips, the app that Apple is planning to release in April that will use “They are building a competitor to Path,” is how one person we know described it, in reference to the social app founded by Dave Morin, the investor who also was an early employee at Facebook; and Shawn Fanning and Dustin Mireau, both formerly of Napster.

Path gained some early popularity for providing a way for small groups of friends to share pictures and chat with each other, one of the early counterbalances to the more open-ended, share-everything tendencies on services like Twitter and Facebook.

In a little twist of what might have been, Google even tried to buy it. But as is often the way with apps, Path eventually waned in popularity. It was eventually sold to Korean messaging giant Kakao in 2015 (it’s still around btw).

Google has had a very patchy history when it comes to social media, and it’s an area that the company still trying to get right. The current strategy seems to be one of running a bunch of slightly different apps and efforts simultaneously to see what works, and what does not (which could be one reason why this was worked on as a separate app rather than, say, as part of an update to Google Photos).

While Allo and Duo continue to get updates, Spaces — a group app for sharing and exploring links to things by tapping into other existing Google services, which seems closest to what it’s trying to build in the app that’s being tested now — closed down after less than a year.

Then there is G+, still going but not the social networking magnet that Google once envisioned it could be. Google Wave, Google Buzz and Orkut are among the various efforts that have come and gone after failing to get enough traction.

Why keep returning to social? Because Google faces competition from the likes of Facebook, Twitter and now Snapchat for consumers’ — and thus advertisers’ — attention. Many (not all but many) users today do not think of search engines first when looking for information, deciding how to spend their money, and finding things to entertain themselves. They go to these other apps, and that ultimately can cut into Google’s mainstay advertising business and revenues.

YouTube, with its focus on user-generated videos mixed with premium content like Vevo, remains Google’s most successful social play, although it’s known more for ushering in virally popular material rather than for helping to keep the conversation going around it (although Google does do some of that, too, in videos’ comments section).

The fact that Google is considering how it can leverage some of the tech that’s been built to help power image search on YouTube, its search portal and its Photos app, to see if that can be used to get a foothold in social is interesting. As is the timing: Apple will be releasing its own gentle step into social media apps — Clips, which lets you edit videos and then share them on various social networks — in April.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Just kidding; please don’t do that. Google regularly issues warnings to people whose accounts are or have been targeted by state-sponsored attackers, and every time it does, users get really nervous that their emails are going to wind up on WikiLeaks. Don’t freak out if you get one of these notices — it doesn’t necessarily mean that your account has been compromised, it just means you should think about taking a few extra steps to secure your account.

I got a “government-backed attack” warning. What does it mean?

You’re in good company — lots of journalists and academics have received warnings like these. According to Google, it means that a sophisticated attacker has tried to gain access to your account using phishing, malware or some other tactic.

Just because you get a warning doesn’t mean you’ve been hacked, though.

“We send these out of an abundance of caution — the notice does not necessarily mean that the account has been compromised or that there is a widespread attack. Rather, the notice reflects our assessment that a government-backed attacker has likely attempted to access the user’s account or computer through phishing or malware, for example,” Shane Huntley, a member of Google’s Threat Analysis Group, wrote.

Unfortunately, you’re unlikely to hear more information, such as when the attack happened or whether or not it was successful. Google doesn’t always send the warnings out right away and doesn’t give specifics about the attack or the responsible parties because it doesn’t want to tip hackers off about how they were detected. If Google says too much, the attackers will change their tactics — and then Google might not be able to warn you about the next attack.

“In order to secure some of the details of our detection, we often send a batch of warnings to groups of at-risk users at the same time, and not necessarily in real-time,” Huntley added.

So what do I do now?

It's crucially important to neither under- nor overestimate these warnings. If you get one: #1 don't panic & #2 take appropriate action. https://t.co/GwQMUbuKs4 — Stephan Somogyi (@thinkpanzer) March 24, 2017

Google recommends several steps to secure your account. The company offers a quick Security Checkup, which lets you review the devices and apps that have access to your account and double-checks your account recovery method.

Google makes some additional recommendations to high-risk users that will help prevent account compromise:

keep your software up-to-date (don’t let those updates languish forever because you don’t feel like pausing a show on Netflix long enough to let them install)

enable 2-step verification on your account (you can do this through regular old text message, but Google recommends its own Authenticator app or a Security Key as the best methods)

install Password Alert in Chrome (or another browser extension that alerts you when you enter your password on a suspicious login page)

Also, pay attention to the email address of the sender and make sure it’s someone you know and trust (rather than someone with a similar email address who’s trying to masquerade as your friend). Don’t click on links and PDFs if you don’t trust the sender. Encrypting email is kind of difficult, but consider doing it anyway, especially if you’re sending sensitive documents or information.

Even if you haven’t gotten a “government-backed attack” warning yet — and you probably won’t as Google only sends them to less than 0.1 percent of users — you can take all these steps to secure your account today. A little extra security never hurts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vardi, who has often been dubbed the ""godfather of Israel technology"" and is the chairman of venture capital firm International Technology Ventures, said that tech companies have usually not acted until a court order has come to them, but this could change.

""Because of the magnitude and the effect of them on everybody's life and becoming the foremost media platform they have to take different issues ... they are being drafted into editing the content and again,"" Vardi said.

His comments come after the U.S. search giant came under fire from brands concerned that their advertisements on Google-owned video service YouTube were being placed next to extremist content. London newspaper The Times, found that ads from brands such as Mercedes-Benz and Waitrose were appearing next to neo-Nazi and jihadi content on YouTube. Many brands have pulled their advertising from YouTube, with the latest being AT&T and Johnson & Johnson.

The news has prompted debate over whether technology firms can just take a hands-off approach, or whether they act more like media companies and edit content.

Google's chief business officer, Philipp Schindler, said on Tuesday the company is going to hire ""significant numbers of people"" and develop new tools using artificial intelligence to improve its ability to review questionable content.

This was followed on Wednesday with an announcement that the online giant was carrying out an extensive review of its advertising policies.

Facebook has also dealt with criticism over its dealing with inappropriate content, particularly around the issue of fake news.

Wall Street has been concerned about the business impact on the likes of Facebook and Google. Vardi said that even if these firms had to bolster the number of people doing oversight on content, it would only be a small cost in comparison to the broader business.

Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOG , GOOGL ) Google Hangouts may remove text message after May 22.

A new report claims that Google Hangouts will alert users that they will no longer be able to use the app for texting on March 27. It claims that users will be asked to select a new default messaging app after this. If they don't have one, they will be taken to the Google Play Store to chose a new messaging app .

The change won't actually stop everyone from using Google Hangouts as a messaging service. Google Voice users will reportedly still be able to use the app for text messaging even after May 22. However, they will get a notification telling them that their carrier number can no longer be used with Hangouts, reports Engadget .

Google Hangouts users that are worried about losing their old messages are fretting over nothing. When choosing a new default messaging app, their old text messages will be transferred over from Hangouts to that one. Google has plenty of messaging apps to chose from on the Play Store.

The reported decision to remove text messaging from Hangouts likely has to do with Alphabet Inc's plans for the app. The company has expressed its interest in making the app more focused on productivity. It hopes to set it up as a better tool for business users, Ars Technica notes.

Investors have been hammered in Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) in more ways than one this week. But is it time to buy GOOGL stock's pullback? Let's take a look at what's behind the price action, the technical picture and a limited-risk options strategy on Alphabet to better navigate the environment.

Source: Travis Wise via Flickr

The consensus view earlier this year had been any political risks facing Alphabet would surely be coming out of China or from Capitol Hill. But it was a problem from across the pond and from our European neighbors in the U.K. that sent shares of GOOGL tumbling this week.

For the weekly period, shares of Alphabet are off about 4% after influential foreign ad buyers lashed out about how their ads had been placed alongside terrorist and other extremism media on Google's YouTube. For its part, Alphabet is taking action and looking to improve its ""brand safety controls.""

Improvements aren't happening soon enough for some though. Earlier this week, as Barron's noted, France's Havas SA , the world's sixth largest marketing agency, stated it had pulled the plug on all client advertising in the U.K. from both YouTube and the Google Display Network.

And now American companies are joining the ranks in protest as well.

In the interim and while the controversy plays out with bulls like Pacific Crest and bears, or at least alarmists , chiming in, we can take a visual look at how things are playing out in GOOGL stock.

GOOGL Stock Daily Chart

Just prior to this week's sudden and volatile bout of profit-taking, GOOGL stock had been making all the right technical moves. Since the beginning of 2017, shares of Alphabet managed to successfully clear the prior all-time highs, rally, establish a successful test of support and then proceed to even higher highs.

Now - despite the quick drop of around 4% this week - our view is Alphabet could be setting up as a pullback entry. For the more quick-fingered among us, the hammering of shares by Thursday's close actually formed a bullish hammer low.

The reversal pattern has some backing from an oversold stochastics condition and received price confirmation early Friday as GOOGL stock moved above the candlestick's high of $841.69.

Is it perfect? No. There has been some distribution, the current setup is modestly below the well-watched 50-day simple moving average and trends do eventually end.

Personally and given the mixed evidence, I'd rather look at entering into GOOGL stock if it were to trade down into a support zone from around $795 - $825. The potential area of support holds a couple retracement levels, the 200-day simple moving average and a second test of the prior highs, and amounts to a correction of up to 9% within the bigger picture's established uptrend.

GOOGL Long Put Butterfly

Given my belief that the hammering may not be completely done in Alphabet, I like the idea of an atypical approach to positioning for downside and buying stock at lower levels.

With GOOGL near $840, the April $835/$820/$805 is priced for $2.20 or better. The bearishly targeted butterfly achieves its maximum profit of $12.80 if shares fall 2.5% to $820 on expiration. More achievable, the limited risk spread maintains a profit range from $807.20 to $832.80 and prior to that third Friday, gains can even be realized outside the targeted price zone.

If GOOGL stock actually begins to rally in a material way, I would personally look to cut risk using a money stop of 50%, or $1.10. While the initial debit is small, holding on and remaining on the wrong side of price action in a name the trader ultimately wants to own at lower prices doesn't make sense.

Were shares of Alphabet to fall below $805, the trader will be out the full debit. However, if the end game is buying GOOGL on weakness as it enters the support zone, knowing the most you'd pay for the stock is $807.20 and possibly a lot less, is worth considering.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) has been on a run — rising 2.66 percent in just three months. It looks like traders are happy with the stock. On the other side, analysts now consider Alphabet Inc. a buy, and a technical analysis of the stock is setting somewhat neutral outlook for now.

Let’s talk about the gap between analyst price targets for the next 12 months and Alphabet Inc. (GOOG)‘s current share price. Normally this spread should be in positive territory, indicating that analysts expect an investment’s value to increase over time. So is with Alphabet Inc.. The median target of analyst views collected by Yahoo Finance was as much as $187.92 below GOOG’s recent stock price. That’s the optimistic view from Wall Street.

The stock has actually made strong gains in the past year, as the company has gathered a 10.77% return in the past twelve months. But even with this move, there is still plenty of room for the company to come back from a longer term perspective, and especially if we look to recent lows for the company as well.

The company’s share price is down -4.39% from previous highs of around $853.5 per share on March 21, 2017. On the bright side, the company’s share price has been on the rebound, up more than 51.6% since hitting lows of $663.28 on June 27, 2016.

Finally, from a technical perspective, there’s a strong possibility that the stock could enter into a new bull market after finding strong support between $807.16 and $812.37. In terms of pullbacks, $822.68 level is the first resistance point. Technical analysis can help recognize key technical price levels in the stock. Investors can use these support and resistance levels to refine their entries and exits from stocks.

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) price is pointing towards neither exit nor entry barriers, according to a technical analysis tool called the Relative Strength Index (RSI). Last session Alphabet Inc. RSI was seen at 36.61. RSI measures the speed and change of a stock price to warn investors when a stock’s momentum has carried it too far. An RSI reading above 80 indicates that a stock is overbought while anything below 20 is oversold.

With these kinds of figures it is worthy to note that Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) has been put into a buy territory, but there are few other spots to consider. The Stochastic %K for GOOG is 20.65. Stochastics is a momentum indicator that uses basic support and resistance levels and integrates with the trend to give accurate buy or sell signals to traders. For stochastics, readings below 20 are considered oversold and you would only take buy signals if the indicator is below that level. A value of 80 is considered overbought and sell signals occurring below that level would be ignored. This leads to longer trades and should result in fewer losses.”)

14-day Williams %R for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) moved to around 87.1. The interpretation of Williams %R is very similar to that of the stochastic oscillator, except that the stochastic oscillator has internal smoothing. The oscillator ranges from 0 to -100. No matter how fast a security advances or declines, Williams %R will always fluctuate within this range. Overbought and oversold levels can be used to identify unsustainable price extremes. Simply put, readings in the range of 80% to 100% indicate that the security is oversold while readings in the 0% to 20% range suggest it is overbought.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $839.65, down from yesterday’s close by -1.19%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data.

Fundamental Analysis

Money managers are always interested in a company that can find the right recipe of fundamental data because it reflects something important going on underneath the surface. Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) currently trades with a market capitalization of $573.79 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 22.20 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report.

The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For GOOGL, the company currently has $12.78 Billion of cash on the books. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $25.83 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to grow in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $7.2 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 0.35% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors.

Technical Analysis

We’ve taken a serious look at this stock from a fundamental perspective, but the tale of the tape may offer more hints about what lies under the surface. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Alphabet Inc. recorded a 52-week high of $874.42. It is now trading 34.77% off that level. The stock is trading $843.44 its 50-day moving average by 3.7900000000001%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $672.66.

In recent action, Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) has made a move of -1.33% over the past month, which has come on weak relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 4.45, and it’s gotten there by action that has been less volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 0.50% with $602.60 Million sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of GOOGL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But is it time to buy GOOGL stock’s pullback? Let’s take a look at what’s behind the price action, the technical picture and a limited-risk options strategy on Alphabet to better navigate the environment.

The consensus view earlier this year had been any political risks facing Alphabet would surely be coming out of China or from Capitol Hill. But it was a problem from across the pond and from our European neighbors in the U.K. that sent shares of GOOGL tumbling this week.

For the weekly period, shares of Alphabet are off about 4% after influential foreign ad buyers lashed out about how their ads had been placed alongside terrorist and other extremism media on Google’s YouTube. For its part, Alphabet is taking action and looking to improve its “brand safety controls.”

Improvements aren’t happening soon enough for some though. Earlier this week, as Barron’s noted, France’s Havas SA, the world’s sixth largest marketing agency, stated it had pulled the plug on all client advertising in the U.K. from both YouTube and the Google Display Network.

And now American companies are joining the ranks in protest as well.

In the interim and while the controversy plays out with bulls like Pacific Crest and bears, or at least alarmists, chiming in, we can take a visual look at how things are playing out in GOOGL stock.

GOOGL Stock Daily Chart

Just prior to this week’s sudden and volatile bout of profit-taking, GOOGL stock had been making all the right technical moves. Since the beginning of 2017, shares of Alphabet managed to successfully clear the prior all-time highs, rally, establish a successful test of support and then proceed to even higher highs.

Now — despite the quick drop of around 4% this week — our view is Alphabet could be setting up as a pullback entry. For the more quick-fingered among us, the hammering of shares by Thursday’s close actually formed a bullish hammer low.

The discounted cash flow analysis below outlines why Alphabet appears undervalued, even when conservative assumptions about its future growth and cost of equity are used. The included sensitivity analysis lets readers see the result of the model using modified assumptions.

Note: I invite you to read my original article that outlines the DCF sensitivity analysis methodology. The basic idea is that since the results of a DCF analysis can be heavily skewed by making minor changes to the terminal growth rate or firm's cost of equity, I have used a range of long-term growth rates and discount [cost of equity] rates in my analysis below. By using one's own estimate of long-term growth and an appropriate discount rate, each individual investor can come up with their own target price for the security in question.

To begin, the past five years of key company data are outlined below:

Alphabet's consistently strong profit margins translate into an average Operating Cash Flow to Revenue Ratio of over 35%. The company has always been known as one willing to spend money on research and development with the goal of continuing to innovate. This strategy shows up in a fairly high CapEx to Revenue Ratio of approximately 12%. The DCF model assumes that these figures will remain constant moving forward, even though it seems likely that the CapEx/Revenue Ratio peaked in 2014 and may continue to fall in the coming years.

Using the analyst consensus revenue forecasts for 2017 and 2018 (source: Yahoo! Finance) leads to the following pro-forma free cash flow [FCF] projection. While analysts expect nearly 18% revenue growth in 2017 and 16% the following year, the model uses a conservative 2% long-term growth rate. Sales growth is projected to slow in a linear fashion from almost 16% in 2018 to 2% in 2022. One can reasonably argue that this estimate is overly pessimistic, but given how quickly Internet trends have changed in the past, using a conservative projection here is the prudent choice.

These free cash flows (along with a terminal free cash flow estimate) are then discounted back to the present time using Alphabet's projected cost of equity. Various different estimates of its beta are available depending on the time frame used, but as per my explanation in this article, the ""adjusted beta"" of the stock was calculated to be 0.74. Based on a 8% market risk premium and risk free rate of 2.5%, Alphabet's discount rate is estimated to be 8.4% (and rounded up to 8.5% in the base case). If you feel like a higher discount rate is warranted, you can see how changing that variable impacts the results of the model in the sensitivity analysis at the end of the article.

After adjusting for Alphabet's significant cash holdings and both classes of outstanding shares, the model gives a target price of $1057, which is more than 25% above the most recent closing price of the Class A shares [GOOGL]:

However, my favorite part of this DCF model is the sensitivity analysis. The below table allows the reader to view the results of 35 different iterations of the model using a range of long-term growth estimates and discount rates. The target prices range from $706 to $1,574 - the cells highlighted in red are more than 10% below the current share price, while those highlighted in green are more than 10% above the current share price:

The above table demonstrates that even with a discount rate as high as 10.5%, Alphabet's shares appear undervalued if it can achieve at least 2% long-term revenue growth.

However, I decided to re-run the DCF model after making a pair of modifications to make the projections even more conservative:

To reflect the possibility that increasing competition lowers Alphabet's margins, the Operating Cash Flow to Revenue Ratio was lowered by 3% from 35.6% to 32.6%. Based on this article, which estimates 60% of Alphabet's cash in held overseas and subject to taxation, the net cash balance was reduced by $15 billion to reflect the potential future tax liability.

Using the same 2% long-term growth rate and 8.5% cost of equity, the model's target price is now $912 - down meaningfully from the previous scenario, but still more than 5% above Alphabet's current share price. Below is an updated sensitivity to reflect the pair of changes made above:

A discounted cash flow analysis (like any other type of security analysis) is full of uncertainty. However, by including two different types of sensitivity analysis (70 results in total), I hope that I have provided some reasonable estimates for the present value of Alphabet's future equity cash flows.

The company is still growing quickly, generates significant free cash flow and has a solid balance sheet flush with cash. For these reasons, my DCF model suggests that Alphabet shares currently represent a compelling opportunity.

Shares of Mountain View, California-based Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are down almost 4% this week after some advertisers started pulling out their advertising from Google’s display network. This was a result of the search engine company's programmatic advertising, which seemingly was not able to stop mainstream brand ads from appearing alongside extremist and offensive material. And the exodus continues with few more big names recently pulling out their ads from Google's YouTube platform for similar reasons as mentioned above. We had recently pointed out that shares of Alphabet Inc, the parent company of Google, could be headed for a near-term correction. So, is GOOGL stock headed much lower? Also, Google's latest ad woes have earned Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL) stock an analyst rating downgrade as well. Should investors be worried? Let's take a closer.

What are the Analysts saying?

The latest YouTube ad woes don't seem to have gone down well with investment firm Pivotal Research. Brian Wieser, Pivotal Research analyst downgraded GOOGL stock to Hold rating from Buy. The reason cited for the downgrade was the lack of control over ad placement on YouTube and the fact that this issue was being cited by major advertisers to withdraw their ad campaigns from the YouTube platform. Brian Wieser opines that Google may have done serious harm and that this could have global repercussions. On account of this, he reduced their ""forecasts for Alphabet by approximately one percentage point for this year and the next. He cut his 2017 estimates to $107.9 billion in revenue and $40.75 per share in net income from a prior $108.8 billion and $24.4 billion."" He slashed his Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL) stock price target from $970 to $950, which still has more than 13% upside from yesterday's close.

However, another Brian does not seem to go down Brian Wieser's way. A Valuewalk post reports that Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak in his latest research note reiterated his Overweight rating and $1,000 price target on GOOGL stock. While he was quick to add, based on his interactions with all participants of the advertising industry, that the ongoing YouTube issue was a real concern for the search giant, he is of the view that impact on the stock would be minimal. He states that ""the affected businesses make up 21% of the company’s gross revenues, with YouTube at 12%, and 10% of net revenues"" and ""if 10% of Alphabet’s gross revenue disappears, it would only drain 1% of its net revenue."" Brian Nowak further adds that the advertisers pulling out are ""only doing it from YouTube and the Google Display Network, and not from its other properties"". He estimates that display ads constitute only 10% of the company’s net revenues and finally highlights that ""the company’s revenues are diversified across millions of clients – with the top 100 ad spenders likely representing less than 20% of total ad revenue.""

Google is expected to continue its dominance in digital ad space.

In its latest research report, eMarketer states that the search giant will maintain its dominance in digital ads taking in 40.7% of US digital ad revenues in 2017—more than double of what Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) would make. The eMarketer research ""expects Google’s share of the search market to grow 16.1% to $28.55 billion in 2017. The search giant will claim roughly 78% of total US search ad revenues this year"". eMarketer forecasting analyst Monica Peart states that Google is set to benefit greatly from users' behavioral shift to mobile search on increasing usage of smartphones. An important point to note here is that the ongoing ad fiasco is largely related to Google's Display Network, where Google lags Facebook by some distance, but in that too eMarketer projects Display Network revenue will rise to $5.24 billion in 2017. The above-cited research had just come recently before the YouTube ad exodus. However, as highlighted by the Morgan Stanley analyst above, the impact on the Google's bottom line due to current ad woes could be minimal and the above estimates may not vary in a drastic way.

Google is still the best.

Google is not the only internet company that is facing issues with programmatic ad buying, Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) and Facebook have had their own share of such issues in the recent past. In response to this whole issue, Google has come out with a public apology through Google's Europe head, Matt Brittin in his address at Advertising Week European conference in London. It also promises to give advertisers more control over where their ads run and make it easier to report any problems such as the recent ones. Paul Verna, principal analyst with eMarketer opines that ""Google needs to sit down with the advertisers that are pulling their ads and reassure them that they're doing more than just issuing an apology. Beyond that, they're going to have to put some other level of human interface into the system, which may be easier said than done because they're handling an almost unimaginable stream of content.""

Eric Schiffler, CEO of digitalmarketing.com as quoted on ThStreet.com conceded that ""Google is still the smartest and the best solution for the great aggregated and targeted traffic, but they have to get their act together"". A Wall Street post also echoes similar views that big advertisers will return to Google, but the latter needs to be cautious in the way it deals with this issue, otherwise, it may be stung hard. It is still early days to write off Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL) stock on account of the current YouTube crisis.

Conclusion.

In spite of the current YouTube issues, GOOGL stock still looks an attractive investment for long-term investors. Google continues to deliver double-digit revenue growth despite its massive revenue base. It is widely anticipated now that Google Cloud would be catching up with Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS and that could be a tailwind for GOOGL stock going ahead. A leading technical indicator, Bollinger Band, suggests that Google stock is set for rebound as it is deemed to be oversold. For now, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL) shares have hit the lower Bollinger band, indicating that the stock is currently in oversold territory, and could rebound soon. Taking a long-term view, Google stock is still a good bet for 2017.

Vu Van is a CEO in San Francisco. Born in Vietnam, she is a member of the auspicious class of Silicon Valley founders who are immigrants — among US startups valued above $1 billion, 51 percent have a foreign-born founder. Van earned her MBA at Stanford, locking herself into a network of hatchling executives. She had a pain point, realized that others shared her problem, and built a company to solve it. She debuted her app, Elsa Speak, at SXSW last year and promptly won an award. On paper, everything was Silicon Valley perfect.

Except that in every other way, Van doesn’t fit the American startup mold. She’s the only member of her company based in the US. She geared up to build her app, an AI assistant for English learners to improve their accents, by returning to Vietnam and immersing herself in the needs of her initial target users. Almost two years later, her seven employees are split between Vietnam and Portugal.

Van doesn’t hesitate to call San Francisco home, but she also stays for a business reason, which is that the networking is second to none. “Vietnam is all about first-generation startups,” Van explains. “Everyone is still figuring out what they’re doing, and no one’s in a good place to mentor.” So she’s planted herself in the one place on Earth where you can’t do your dry cleaning without running into a potential advisor, expert, investor, or future hire. For her company, that edge makes the time zone patchwork worth the sacrifice of sleep and sanity.

So when Van first heard about Google’s new Launchpad Accelerator, she was skeptical. The company was in effect promising mature startups from emerging markets the most epic networking service on the planet: For every hiccup Elsa was facing, Google would match her and two colleagues with a top expert — sometimes the top expert — in that area. For free, with no catch, no quid pro quo. Van decided to give it a shot. Despite her Bay Area bonafides, launching a product in Vietnam had still been a slog.

Elsa is one of the rising stars of The Rest of the World—and Google has a plan to get in the door of companies like Van’s and shape them in its image. It wants to educate them on the best practices of product development and speed up their learning curves. Think of it as strategic philanthropy: In exchange for helping these companies grow, Google gets to scrutinize their books, observe how its own products are being used (or not) in less familiar markets, and spread its gospel to the far reaches of the globe. Eventually, these companies will play an enormous role in getting millions more people to conduct their lives online, and Google will be there as well, ready to scoop up new users.

“The one thing emerging markets are missing is success stories,” says Roy Glasberg, Launchpad’s global manager. “You need an ecosystem.” A wiry Israeli sporting close-cropped hair and performance-wear chic, Glasberg is articulating an ideology percolating inside Google about why so few big companies emerge from outside Silicon Valley. He and his colleagues say the word “ecosystem” a lot. It’s a subtle, unstated way of contrasting the rich environment of the Bay Area, where investors, board members, competitors, and talented workers swirl in a self-pollinating bubble, with the relative deserts of countries such as Indonesia, Mexico, or even bigger players like Brazil. In the ecosystem view, the Bay Area is the goldilocks planet, and the rest of the world has the inhospitable climate of Mars or Mercury.

Google’s theory is that until some company — any company! — has produced a massive IPO or engineered itself an eye-popping acquisition, a developing region won’t amass the resources it needs to support entrepreneurship. Venture capitalists are uneasy, or simply absent. The talent pool is shallow, with few local technologists who have first-hand experience transforming small companies into large ones. When you wonder where to find a good data scientist, or how to negotiate better terms in your series A, or what to fix in your app to get a better conversion rate, no one around you has the answers.

So a delta force within Google, led by Glasberg, set out to see if it could do what countless governments, regional technology parks, and grant programs have failed to do before it: fire up startup kilns around the world that then take on a life of their own. They would do so by picking the sharpest, most proven startups, and showering them with unconditional support for six months (and $50,000, but who’s counting)— essentially treating them as integrated wings of Google for the duration.

To earn that kind of access, these startups have to be much more than a Gucci knockoff. They’re not just the Postmates of the Philippines, or the Tesla of Thailand. They are fiercely unique, tackling unsolved problems and producing code that rivals anything emerging from San Francisco or the South Bay. These are the brightest minds of elsewhere. And Google’s now giving them a jolt of adrenaline straight from the planet’s entrepreneurial mothership: itself.

Transporting the magic of Silicon Valley to other cities is a trope so old, and so beloved by government bureaucrats, that these days it hardly quickens the pulse. Silicon Alley. Silicon Glen. Silicon Wadi. Silicon Fen.

Seated at a small table in the brand new San Francisco offices of the Launchpad Accelerator, Glasberg explains why Google’s approach is fundamentally different. “No one else is looking at emerging markets as a whole,” he says.

Around him, a hundred-some entrepreneurs huddle in small group meetings with an elder statesman (or sometimes woman) of technology, or stare intently at their screens while seated elbow-to-elbow. We had to hunt to find two empty chairs, and eventually settled in between clusters of men leaning against low-slung cabinets, messenger bags strewn at their feet. The office hums with the low, persistent drone of voices.

Glasberg, who first joined Google in Tel Aviv after a career in business development, has been formulating his own global theory of startup victory. “When you have a few successful startups, they come back and start investing in their community, starting funds,” Glasberg says. “You get a whole community boosting other startups.” He starts ticking off countries. “You don’t have that in Latin America. Brazil has never had a big exit. Argentina has had one.” From an investor’s point of view, he adds, startups “are already a risky business. So why should I go into a country that’s never had an exit?”

The local venture capitalists who do take a stake in emerging market companies tend to push for a faster path to monetization than do the firms on Sand Hill Road, which in turn affects how a startup develops its products. (With more generous funding, entrepreneurs often feel free to chase after a riskier, higher-payoff goal.) Some investors may demand a bigger cut of the company. The startup’s workers, meanwhile, are similarly circumspect about their employers, often requiring high salaries rather than agreeing to work for equity.

The problems don’t end with investment. Without having played host to past startups that either IPO’d or got acquired, a country will be home to few—if any—entrepreneurs with first-hand experience of building a company from ten employees to hundreds or thousands, navigating that country’s particular regulatory landscape, or overcoming the challenges that define many emerging markets, such as poor connectivity. In a word, they’re missing expertise.

So in 2015, Glasberg started scheming how Google might throw its weight behind solving what seemed to be the core problem—the lack of success stories. They settled on a strategy: They’d identify the best companies and try to solve as many of their business challenges as they could in a two-week Bay Area immersion program, followed by six months of remote mentorship.

To have the most impact, Glasberg says, he and his collaborators decided they wanted more mature startups, whose products already have a healthy base of users. Often these companies are two or three years old, sometimes with 100 or more employees, and most of them have already raised a round or two of funding. Many of them are profitable. So rather than risk alienating the most promising companies, which might not want to give up any more slices of their equity, the Launchpad team decided that it would simply advise — and reap rewards for Google through other channels.

“The equity-free model lets us play the accelerator game further down the startup’s evolution,” explains Josh Yellin, a program manager on Glasberg’s team. A former river ecologist, he joined Google in September 2015 to manage programming for the company’s startup communities, before moving over to help build the nascent accelerator. While he was preparing for Launchpad’s inaugural Winter 2016 class, the founders he talked to were at first confused by the word “accelerator,” which usually applies to earlier-stage startups, when really he was targeting companies on the verge of rapid expansion. “We tossed around the word ‘scale-a-rator,’ but that sounds like some kind of animal no one would want to meet,” Yellin recalls.

Last month, the third group of Launchpad inductees — three or so employees each from 31 companies out of nine countries — went through their two-week blitz at Google’s Bay Area offices. Around 150 mentors also joined, many flying in from around the world to conduct deep, screen-by-screen code reviews, assess every app’s design in minute detail, and pore over each company’s hiring practices.

“We now have three classes of data of every mentorship session that happens. We have a note from every mentor of what came out of it—what was the challenge, and what was the solution recommended,” Yellin says. Using all those reports, “we’re basically creating a map of what makes startups successful around the world.”

When they joined, the founders, many of them in their thirties, many of them armed with battle-tested self-assurance, were told they could name anyone among Google’s almost 50,000 employees, and the company would broker an introduction. It wasn’t hyperbole.

One founder and CEO, Reynazran Royono of Indonesia’s Snapcart, came to Launchpad nagged by an AI problem his team hadn’t solved. Snapcart users scan their receipts to earn cash-back rewards, but as the company grew to include 5,000 different grocery store chains and receipt formats, its engineers had stumbled into image recognition purgatory. So he requested a session with an expert on Tensorflow, Google’s widely used AI platform, and discovered that what he’d thought of as a mere annoyance was actually an open research question. “We talked to the Tensorflow guy, he said what we’re trying to crack is very difficult and he wanted to help,” Royono says. “But we’d get not just support from his team, but from the Google Brain guys, or the Ph.D. guys, to get help in cracking this problem.”

A Brazilian startup called Portal Telemedicina, meanwhile, went straight for the crown jewels. It has built up a network of online doctors who can diagnose the scans and data generated by numerous clinics’ medical devices, and it also relies heavily on AI. “We said, OK, I want to talk to the head of artificial intelligence at Google,” says Rafael Figueroa, the company’s founder and CEO. “They connected us with the guy in England, who, like, invented this stuff. He knows stuff that wasn’t available online anywhere!”

The companies don’t just get resolution to bugs, though, as if they’re attending office hours back in college. The program is also built to spread startup best practices through hundreds of one-on-one sessions. For Van, the Vietnamese founder of Elsa, a prime goal was to steep two of her colleagues from Portugal in the Silicon Valley product development ethos: Iterate quickly, and don’t be afraid to launch imperfect products. In one meeting with a mentor, the team discussed how to solve some issues with its app’s onboarding flow. They were noticing that new users were dropping out partway through the app’s sign-up process, but they couldn’t figure out how to plug the leak. Her mentor, a renowned user experience expert named Jacob Greenshpan, suggested she try implementing a specific change over the weekend and see what happens. She said she’d think about it, falling back into a pattern of methodical deliberation that often characterized her team’s work. “And he said, ‘No, this is your homework for Saturday.’ So I said, ‘OK. Fine.’ And it worked! We got a 25 percent improvement,” she marvels.

Van is the kind of entrepreneur who actually does her homework—who’ll read the 100-page manual and pore over every online resource she can find. But on normal days, she’s still effectively working alone. And her team can only absorb so many tech mantras from afar. Those limitations turn into the months-long headaches of, say, an imperfect onboarding experience.

What these entrepreneurs’ stories suggest is there’s an implicit exceptionalism to how we view successful startups. The usual story goes something like this: The right group of founders got together, built an outstanding piece of software, and, through their collective brilliance, managed to accrue thousands and then millions of users. That framework is not wrong, exactly — but it underestimates the enormous boost these companies get by virtue of geography and timing. Silicon Valley startups are like plants in a nursery, kept out of the cold, bathed in sunlight, and lightly spritzed on a daily basis. Out in the wild they’d end up more scraggly, if they survive at all—so it’s a good thing someone came around beforehand to build their cozy greenhouse.

But even as these companies from outside the Valley get help from Google, some of them are beginning to compete with it. Van, for example, recently hired an engineer with expertise in AI out from under Google’s nose. Both Google and Amazon had made that engineer offers with significantly more money than Elsa could muster, Van says. But Elsa’s mission, with its potential to have a strong social impact, resonated with the engineer, so she turned down the Americans’ princely sums and moved from her home in Ukraine to join the team in Portugal.

Google, meanwhile, gains plenty from bringing these startups into its fold. To get accepted, the companies undergo a grueling review, opening their books fully to Google employees. What emerges are not only the financial and technical details of individual companies, but also a growing portrait of startup health in a dozen different trying environments.

Then there’s the product evangelism that occurs throughout the program. It’s no secret that Google has developed many platforms useful to startups —Firebase, Tensorflow, Google Cloud—and through Launchpad it’s assembled a captive audience of stellar engineers to listen as its employees rhapsodize about their favorite tools. “If they get the best startups to use their products in an early stage, it’s really hard to switch in the future, because the cost of switching is so high,” Van says.

Glasberg takes a broader view. “Google gets two things out of this. One is really understanding what it takes to be a successful entrepreneur in emerging markets.” The other is that they can observe, under a microscope, developers from all corners of the world using Google products — the ultimate feedback. “We see firsthand what is working and what is not,” Glasberg says. “This is super critical, because these markets are the next billion. That’s where the future is.”

The present, however, remains stubbornly in the Bay Area. Van has just returned from another of her lightning trips to visit her team in Vietnam. But after each lap of the globe she always settles back into San Francisco, to drink from the firehose once more.

“The team behind the mobile-first index wants it to launch this year,” Illyes told our SMX West conference on Wednesday. “We’re still experimenting. We don’t have a timeline. It could be a few months or quarters, but it’s definitely not weeks [away]. Don’t freak out, especially if you have a responsive site.”

Illyes first revealed plans to create a separate mobile-first index back in October and said at the time that it was “months away” from becoming reality. Five months later, that’s still the case.

The change is prompted by the fact that, since 2015, more than half of all Google searches are happening on mobile devices. When the change happens, Google will use the mobile version of web content as its primary index and rank results based on that mobile content, even for desktop searchers.

One of the big challenges in making this switch is that the mobile web has fewer signals for Google to use.

“The mobile web has fewer tokens than desktop. Content and links are more scarce,” Illyes said. “Mobile sites don’t have a lot of the metadata that desktop sites have. We’re aiming for a quality-neutral launch. We don’t want users to experience a loss in quality of search results. We need to replace the signals that are missing in the mobile web.”

He also explained that Google is working on a new page speed measurement process that’s specific to mobile sites, because using the desktop page speed measurement isn’t relevant.

He offered a brief to-do list for SEOs to prepare for the mobile-first index:

Make sure your mobile site has the content you want to rank for. Make sure structured data are on your mobile site. Make sure rel-annotations are on your mobile site.

Illyes said Google will provide more guidance on the last two points in the future.

His most important advice?

“What we do is, we match ads and the content, but because we source the ads from everywhere, every once in a while somebody gets underneath the algorithm and they put in something that doesn’t match. We’ve had to tighten our policies and actually increase our manual review time and so I think we’re going to be okay,” Schmidt told the FOX Business Network’s Maria Bartiromo.

Rosenberg explained that as Google has grown as a company its focus has shifted so it can better address these kinds of issues.

“What we’re focused on now is organizing around the CEOs who can have the kind of technical insights to build products that solve these kind of problems,” said Rosenberg.

Schmidt explained that YouTube’s enormous growth has made it a big responsibility and challenge to manage.

“YouTube for example went from about 100 million hours of watched per day, to one billion hours of YouTube watched globally per day, it’s an extraordinary platform and an extraordinary responsibility.”

According to Schmidt, it is possible for computers to solve the issue of dealing with extremist videos as well as fake news.

“My own view on most of this sort of extremist things as well as fake news in general is that it’s essentially a ranking problem. We’re very good at detecting what’s the most relevant and what’s the least relevant. It should be possible for computers to detect malicious, misleading and incorrect information and essentially have you not see it.”

Though Schmidt does not see this as censorship, saying, “We’re not arguing for censorship, we’re arguing just take it off the page, put it somewhere else.”

But Schmidt viewed it as a bigger issue with social media.

“It’s a big problem in social media in my view, the social media thinks in terms of links, not ranking right? And there’s undifferentiated linkings, like I’m going to link to here and here and all of a sudden they’ve discovered they think that what they think is a woman who’s a passionate activist who’s in fact a computer right, run by the Russians or whatever stereotype you have.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alphabet's had a tough week, with a number of agencies pulling advertisements from the platform due to fears about what content their ads could be placed next to.

But don't worry about Google or YouTube, said Vox Media CEO Jim Bankoff on CNBC's ""Power Lunch.""

Facebook would be the likely beneficiary if there was a drop in interest in YouTube ads, wrote Mahaney. A recent RBC/AdAge survey showed just how strong advertiser interest in social, mobile and video ads has been, he wrote.

But on Wednesday the company pulled off an impressive, and curious, feat: It wowed the public with an eight-year-old idea.

Google unveiled a new set of features for its popular Maps app that lets users share their locations with friends and contacts in real time. Thanks to this update, Google Maps users will now be able to quickly let friends know if they're running late to a meeting or stuck in traffic.

It's a compelling idea. And if you're wondering why Google hadn't thought of this earlier, the answer is: It did.

In 2009, when smartphones were still in their infancy, Google introduced something called Latitude.

The Latitude app, to quote Google's blog post announcing it, ""allows you to share your location with your friends and to see their approximate locations, if they choose to share them with you."" In other words, it's almost the exact same feature Google is now touting as the hot new thing.

Take a look at the two side by side.

Here is Google Latitude, circa 2009:

And here is a screenshot of the new Google Maps location-sharing feature:

The interfaces look almost identical, even though technology has changed dramatically in the past eight years. (The initial version of Google Latitude was for BlackBerry phones.)

At the time Latitude was launched, the app drew widespread privacy concerns. Privacy International, a European watchdog group, published a report highlighting the risk that users might not be aware Latitude was enabled and could thus track their whereabouts. A Google spokeswoman told Computerworld at the time that the company took user feedback about privacy seriously and was adding notifications to alert users when Latitude was turned on.

Hello again

Eight years later, the privacy concerns haven't gone away, but by and large, the outcry has been a footnote to the story. Instead, most of the coverage has focused on the benefits of sharing locations — for example, allowing parents to keep track of their smartphone-toting children — not fear-mongering about how it could go wrong.

The world has changed since 2009 when Google first tried this. Two billion people are on Facebook's social network. Millions of people wear bracelets that record their physical activity. The new hot gadget du jour is an eavesdropping microphone-speaker device with an innocent name like Alexa that consumers voluntarily put in their kitchens to get quick weather updates and sports scores.

It's not the first time we've seen a once controversial tech product resurface in new packaging a few years later to a much warmer reception. Just look at how much cooler people think Snap's video-recording sunglasses are now, only a few years after Google Glass.

The Google Maps location-sharing comeback is a good reminder of how quickly technology moves and how fluid our seemingly deeply rooted societal norms might be.

Canada-based mobile phone company BlackBerry Ltd (NASDAQ: BBRY ) used to be an undisputed giant in the cell phone market. Back in 2009, its namesake phones, which were considered indispensable to its customers, boasted an estimated 20% market share.

Source: Shutterstock

That market share, when rounded, is now 0%. BlackBerry sold only a couple hundred thousand phones last quarter.

This pales in comparison to the millions of phones sold by Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and those running Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOG ,NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Android software. The BlackBerry stock price tells the tale - down 50% over the past five years.

Can BlackBerry Stock Save Itself?

BlackBerry has been trying to shift gears and now considers itself a mobile software firm. It is also targeting mobile security. It has officially given up on hardware and no longer makes its own phones. The firm has fallen from an industry leader to more or less fighting for survival. BlackBerry stock remains beaten down, but has potential with any operational recovery.

BlackBerry released its fiscal third-quarter earnings back in December. The results weren't pretty . Sales fell 47% to $289 million and the net loss was $117 million, or 22 cents per share. Operating cash flow for the nine months of its fiscal year was a negative $242 million. Quarterly hardware sales fell by two-thirds to $70 million.

Positively, the company still had nearly $1.3 billion in cash in the bank, or a couple of dollars per share. But netted against $607 million in debt and burning through cash as it repositions its business, it could fall to negligible levels if things don't turn around within the next several quarters.

Management put as positive a spin as it could on the most recent quarter: 80% of software sales are recurring and the firm boasted more than 3,000 enterprise customer orders during the quarter. Business customers had been extremely loyal to Blackberry as many individual consumers had used their ""Crackberry"" devices for both business and pleasure.

Its press release touted its highest quarterly gross margins (67%) in the firm's history, operating profitability, and ""overall positive non-GAAP EPS."" Back out enough losses, and most firms can achieve adjusted profitability. But the negative cash flow cannot be undone by accounting maneuvers.

BlackBerry did say it expects to break even on a cash flow basis during the fourth quarter. It expects to report its latest results on March 31. It plans to update investors on a business venture with car giant Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F ) where it provides connected car and software licensing in certain Ford vehicles.

Despite the few positive developments, BlackBerry's full year results are likely to be grim. Analysts expect sales to fall 37% to $1.4 billion and adjusted earnings of only a couple of pennies. Next year isn't projected to be any easier - analysts are calling for a sales decline of 28% to under a billion, and another couple of pennies of profits.

During its earnings call, BlackBerry talked of enterprise software products where security is a key feature. Software that helps companies run mobile platforms and apps is clearly a growth industry, as is embedded mobile software for automobiles, such as those made by Ford.

Management also talked about huge opportunities in the Internet of Things, or IoT. It also licenses its software, such as with a partner in Indonesia. As it turns out, BlackBerry's messaging service remains hugely popular in Indonesia . It boasts 55 million active users, demonstrating the network effect that can help support a platform.

Bottom Line on BlackBerry Stock

BlackBerry's service revenue growth is noteworthy, but doesn't appear to be accelerating rapidly. Its software seems to work well in automobiles, but anything to support self-driving cars appears to only be in prototype mode. Indonesia is a bright spot, but not enough to drive the overall company forward.

BlackBerry operates in many appealing and growing industries, but seems to be at too much of a disadvantage compared to the competition. Apple's iOS and Google's Android software dominate the mobile phone space right now. Without the related hardware sales, it seems extremely difficult to see BlackBerry breaking back into a leadership position in the mobile market in a big way.

Investors would probably be best served by waiting to see how BlackBerry's fourth-quarter results turn out. The earnings release is just a couple of weeks away. If software sales come in ahead of expectations and cash flow trends perk up, shareholders might gain some confidence that the company can start returning to growth, or at least some level of consistent profitability.

The recent downturn in AlphabetInc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) became a little more exacerbated on Thursday morning, and now GOOGL stock is starting to dip into some dangerous territory.

Source: Shutterstock

Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser downgraded Alphabet shares on Monday, March 20, from ""Buy"" to ""Hold.""

Wieser's issue was a number of large companies, including McDonald's Corporation (NYSE: MCD ), bailing out their advertisements from the YouTube video platform over lack of targeting capabilities. The specific worry is that ads will be shown alongside videos from extremist and terrorist groups, as well as anything portraying hate speech.

AT&T Inc (NYSE: T ) and Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ ) have also pulled their ads since then. Per an AT&T spokesperson:

""We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate. Until Google can ensure this won't happen again, we are removing our ads from Google's non-search platforms.""

Other companies that have dropped their YouTube ads include HSBC Holdings plc (ADR) (NYSE: HSBC ), GlaxoSmithKline plc (ADR) (NYSE: GSK ) and Enterprise . The price target drop - from $970 to $950 - betrayed the downgrade a little, as that still implied roughly 10% upside in GOOGL stock from there.

Nonetheless, shares fell hard on the news, dropping nearly 4% between then and now, including a roughly 2% drop in Thursday's early trading.

GOOGL shares plunged below their short-term 20-day average initially, and today have sunk below the 50-day moving average, which has provided support for shares twice since mid-December, when the stock surged through the MA.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has plunged to 38 - low, but still not near oversold levels.

From here, GOOGL stock risks a further drop to price support around $810 - another 3% from here. Below that would be the 200-day MA, which sits just below the $800 mark.

Looked at optimistically, though, Alphabet has been setting a small series of higher lows and higher highs since the beginning of the new year, precipitously dropping off in February before rebounding to hit new highs above $870 just last week.

This very well could be a much-needed breather in GOOGL stock - one that has dunked the forward price-to-earnings ratio to a thoroughly digestible 21, which isn't shabby for a nearly $600 billion company that's still projected to grow revenues by double digits this year and next.

As of this writing, Robert Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

(NASDAQ: AMZN) has a hit on its hands with its artificial intelligence -based Alexa virtual assistant and the products powered by the digital darling. The Echo smart home speaker, its miniature sibling the Dot, and the portable Tap have taken the world by storm. Alexa was the hit of the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show, and its family of products, which also includes the Fire TV stick and Fire tablet, were top sellers on Amazon.com during the 2016 holiday season.

If Alexa suffers from one key disadvantage, it's the lack of a smartphone to call home . Apple 's(NASDAQ: AAPL) Siri resides on the iPhone, and Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Google Assistant lives on the company's Android ecosystem. With opposing virtual assistants taking up residence on hundreds of millions of phones worldwide, how would Alexa ever compete? Several recent developments are making this disadvantage less of an issue.

Call me

Recode is reporting that Amazon is planning upgrades that would allow Alexa-powered devices to initiate phone calls using voice commands. This new communication functionality would extend to other Alexa devices, working in much the same way as an intercom. If true, this capability would partially address the disadvantage compared to other digital assistants, which are primarily smartphone-based.

Amazon is taking other steps to counter its virtual assistant's marked deficiency. Amazon reveled this week that Alexa would soon be found in Amazon's official iPhone app, already one of the more popular downloads in Apple's app store. Users will be able to tap the microphone button inside the Amazon app to access Alexa, which essentially brings its myriad of skills to the iPhone. And it won't be the only phone sporting Alexa. Earlier this year, Chinese phone giant Huawei revealed that its Mate 9 phone would be the ""First smartphone with Amazon Alexa."" With these recent announcements, it probably won't be long before Alexa is available on Google's Android phones.

In my house

Estimates for sales of the Alexa family of products vary. Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) estimates that 8.2 million US consumers own an Alexa-powered device. Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimated total sales at 11 million by early December 2016, but admit that number is too low, having missed out on the high-volume Black Friday and holiday sales. Including strong holiday sales, those numbers could be in the range of 13 to 15 million. With an estimated 125 million U.S. households, Alexa could be nearing a 10% penetration rate.

What have you done for me lately?

Alexa's popularity seems to stem from more than the mere novelty of the product. Amazon released a skills kit early on that encouraged developers to create voice commands, which connected Alexa to their products and services. Amazon recently announced that developers had published more than 10,000 skills for the virtual assistant, giving it the clear lead in terms of usefulness. With that many choices, you might wonder how to find the skills most useful to you. Alexa has that covered, with a Skill Finder feature that also presents a ""skill of the day"" for the asking. Other popular offerings include games like the Potterhead quiz for Harry Potter fans, trainer tips for fans of Pokemon Go , ordering your favorite Domino's pizza, and even help deciding what to watch on TV or at the movies.

Foolish final thoughts

Addressing the key disadvantage that stood between Alexa and consumers is an indication of how seriously the company views its ecosystem. The family of products have even been prominently displayed in Amazon's growing number of bookstores. Early sales won't make a dent in Amazon's revenue, a gargantuan $44 billion in the company's most recent quarter, so why the big push? A recent analyst note may provide a clue. Mark Mahaney and Jim Shaughnessy from RBC Capital Markets predict that it could be worth an additional $10 billion in annual sales of devices and products by 2020. With that much riding on Alexa, it's no wonder that Amazon would go to such lengths to up its game.

Google has faced fallout on Wall Street this week as advertisers put pronounced pressure on the company's policies.



Google is one of the top platforms for digital advertisers, accounting for about 40 percent of all online ad budgets, and 13 percent of display ad budgets, according to eMarketer. Google's YouTube video site ran ads for major brands next to neo-Nazi and jihadist videos, according to The Times of London. Companies like AT&T and Johnson & Johnson have since suspended some digital advertising, and some analysts said the outcry could be a concern for the company's outlook.

Schmidt was asked whether he can ensure that the algorithm doesn't make the same mistake again.

""We can't guarantee it, but we can get pretty close,"" he said.

Google has increased the time it takes to manually review ad matching and violations of Google's terms of service, Schmidt said. Hopefully, Google can build products that can move extreme content down in the rankings in a way that's better than what social media does, Schmidt said.

""We're very good at detecting what's the most relevant and what's the least relevant. It should be possible for computers to detect malicious, misleading and incorrect information and essentially have you not see it. We're not arguing for censorship, we're arguing just take it off the page, put it somewhere else...make it harder to find,"" Schmidt said, adding: ""I think we're going to be ok.""

Schmidt also appeared on ""CBS This Morning,"" where he discussed the new presidential administration. He said that it was ""literally crazy"" to not allow talented people to come to America, just because they are foreign.

""It is insane to allow people to stay in other countries who want to come to our country to create companies, and to create new jobs, create wealth, and power our economy,"" Schmidt said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That message has grown stronger as the technical chart setup has developed into a more composite picture for the stock. This is the breakdown as we see it. There’s only one thing better than one tool when trading stocks and that is two tools. For many trading is all about fundamentals – their one tool to rule them all. But people in this camp miss out when they ignore the power of technical charts. Use them in in addition to the fundamentals, and you become near-unstoppable.

The 50 and 200 SMAs for GOOG have created a marked trend which is now helping traders to make solid decisions regarding the stock. It’s a trend that is now unmistakable. Based on the trend levels presented by both indicators, the overall sentiment towards GOOG is best described as bullish. This trend has created a unified opinion across the trading floor and it is clear that the overall outlook for the stock is now established as positive. But it’s not just the outlook that’s being affected for the stock. Thanks to the consolidated opinion on GOOG, activity has also seen a pronounced trend. Under current sentiments the volume activity and subsequent trend has created a weak outlook from buyers and sellers. For traders that have invested emotionally in the outcomes surrounding GOOG, the current trend being solidified is somewhat telling. It is unsurprising in the case of GOOG, that the current trend has created some indifference among traders regarding the stock. In terms of consistency, it is clear that both the 50 and 200 SMAs have done their job in bring traders the overall trend-picture currently being seen for GOOG.

There is of course more to the tale than just what the SMAs have presented. For those added details, we can take a look at the Relative strength indicator (RSI) and Stochastic measures, both of which give deeper insights into the overall sentiment of buyers and sellers. SMAs will tell alert you to price direction, but when it comes to judging what buyers and sellers are doing, few indicators are better than RSI and the Stochastic. It as this level of technical data that a trader can determine whether a stock is currently overbought is oversold. The current picture for GOOG is of course very telling based on these two additional measures. Based on current readings, GOOG’s 14-day RSI is 47.03%. Taken on the standard scale of measurement for RSI, this suggests that GOOG is neutral, suggesting that the stock is relatively stable in terms of price movement up or down. The stochastic reading offers another solid measure of whether the stock is either overbought, or oversold. In the case of GOOG, Stochastic readings gathered over the last 30 days have created a score of 47.98%. This suggests GOOG is neither overbought or oversold at prevailing levels.

If you really want to extract the maximum information and slant from a stock, there’s really no better way than combining the above technical indicators with other more deeply ingrained technical measures. By this point in the analysis of GOOG, it is clear that other technical indicators are saying essentially the same things. Specifically the -1.17 has birthed a negative overall sentiment when measured over the previous 30 days or so of trading. Over the longer-term GOOG has underperform the S&P 500 by -3.1. This has, unsurprisingly, created lower volatility levels when compared with similar stocks of the same grade and class. Historical volatility is no less consistent. The historical volatility picture for GOOG is shown in the reading of 10.69%. GOOG has clearly shown its full hand by the overall input of these technical indicators. But there is one final measure that when added to the already rich mix, shows in full color what GOOG is doing. The indicator is the Average True Range, and based on the current 1.02 reading, GOOG is certainly worth paying attention to.

At least one analyst downgraded Alphabet stock earlier this week after reports of big brand advertisers pulling away from YouTube and Google Display Network because their ads were being placed with offensive videos, particularly content that promotes hate or terrorism.

However, not all analysts are worried, as the Google parent company may be too big for it to matter.

Alphabet stock price target still at $1,000

In a research note dated March 23, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak reiterated his Overweight rating and $1,000 price target on Alphabet stock. He noted that the headlines related to the fiasco are likely to weigh on the stock’s multiple, but he anticipates that the impact in dollars will be small. He pegs display ads at 10% of the company’s net revenues and adds that the business has “high advertiser diversification.”

Despite his skepticism that this is a serious problem for Google and YouTube, he does note that this is a real concern that the company will have to address, citing his conversations with advertisers and other participants in the industry. Google is making some efforts to fix the problem such as raising the bar on its ad policies. However, Nowak notes that today’s report that Verizon, AT&T, Johnson & Johnson, Enterprise and others have pulled back their spending with the company demonstrates that it isn’t doing enough.

A concern, but not yet

He added that this issue will be a key one to keep tabs on in the next few weeks because he does see the headlines and the possibility of more advertisers dropping out as a “likely tactical headwind” for Alphabet stock and its multiple. He noted that YouTube has successfully worked through problems like this in the past though.

Even though he sees the validity of the concerns, if the company does deal with them, he sees a “low probability” that they will have any serious impact on the company’s near-term results. One reason is because advertisers that pulled their ad dollars are only doing it from YouTube and the Google Display Network and not from its other properties.

Further, he estimates that the affected businesses make up 21% of the company’s gross revenues, with YouTube at 12%, and 10% of net revenues. He said if 10% of Alphabet’s gross revenue disappears, it would only drain 1% of its net revenue. And finally, he feels that the company’s revenues are “diversified across millions of clients – with the top 100 ad spenders likely representing less than 20% of total ad revenue.”

Alphabet stock downgraded earlier this week

Nowak doesn’t feel that Alphabet stock is expensive at current levels, so he feels that investors should take advantage of any pullback in the shares in the next few days or weeks. However, not everyone is so upbeat on the outcome from these issues. On Monday, Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser downgraded Alphabet stock, moving to Hold from Buy. He also bumped his price target down a bit from $970 to $950 per share.

InvestorPlace noted that Alphabet stock fell below its short-term 20-day moving average and then after today’s drop, the shares fell below their 50-day moving average. This level has supported the stock twice since the middle of December, the website notes. The stock’s Relative Strength Index also tumbled to 38, although it hasn’t reached oversold levels yet. However, InvestorPlace warns that Alphabet stock may drop to the next support at around $810, but the 200-day moving average sits just under $800 a share.

The telecom companies join other companies that have stepped back from Google, after an investigation from The Times of London found that ads for Mercedes-Benz and Marie Curie were running next to jihadist and neo-Nazi content.

Google apologized and revamped its ad policy on Tuesday, especially on YouTube. Google said it will start ""removing ads more effectively from content that is attacking or harassing people,"" and will change the default safety setting for ads.

Google said on Wednesday that it couldn't comment on AT&T, citing a policy against commenting on individual customers. But the company said it is raising the bar for its ads to safeguard brands.

(RTTNews.com) - Offensive and extremist content appearing along with display ads has been creating headache for Google. There has been strong protests and boycott of ads by major advertisers and this has forced the company to expand their controls.

The tech giant said the advertisers will have more say to display of ads on YouTube and other Google networks.

The protest was strong in Europe with several companies pulling out their ads from Google's network. The U.K. government joined in protest last week. The guardian, French ad giant Havas, etc. joined the resistance. Companies have made it clear that they don't want ads next to the content that contradict their values.

He added that Google have made a public commitment to give brands more control over where their ads appear.

Schindler said there will be changes in ad policies, enforcement and new controls for advertisers. Google plans tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content. They will try to remove ads from derogatory content attacking religion, race or gender.

But that was the intent.

While I’m admittedly an unabashed cheerleader of Intel, I can still appreciate the rags-to-riches story that AMD CEO Lisa Su has successfully executed since her appointment in January 2012. AMD stock traded at $5.40 at the time. The stock recently made a 52-week high of $15.55. Save for the people at AMD headquarters, no one anticipated this remarkable turnaround. But what’s good for AMD is also good for Intel since a excitement surrounding chip battles increases consumer interest.

Notably, this renewed battle comes even as the rate of PC revenue continues to decline. In other words, both companies, which struggled at the height of the mobile era, have moved beyond being just PC shops. And while AMD continues to make impressive leaps, Intel is still the leader. The extent to which AMD pushes Intel to innovate, the better off Intel will be. And that’s exactly what Intel CEO Brian Krzanich has begun to demonstrate.

Looking to avoid the another mobile-type miss, Intel is pushing heavily to be future-ready. Fresh off its second mega-deal in less than two years, Krzanich — in his fifth year at the helm — seems intent on putting Intel’s cash to use. The company’s $15.3 billion acquisition of Israeli self-driving technology company Mobileye ( MBLY ) was the most recent example. This follows $16.7 billion deal for Altera back in 2015.

These two deals suggest that Intel is not worried about what AMD is doing. It can be argued that it should. But Krzanich, who has found ways to get Intel’s top line growing again, has shown to have a good pulse on what the company needs. Not only does Intel, thanks to Altera, now have an inside track on the Internet of Things and data center market, Mobileye now puts Intel in the driver's seat in the realm of autonomous cars, allowing it to better compete with Tesla ( TSLA ) and Google ( GOOGL ).

In both acquisitions, however, market pundits, who were unable to immediately see the financial benefits, criticize Intel for overpaying. But, recall, Google was laughed at for buying YouTube in 2006 for $1.65 billion. Today YouTube is worth an estimated $40 billion today. Likewise, Facebook ( FB ) was criticized for taking out Instagram. But assuming Intel can realize the estimated $70 billion total addressable market of driverless cars by 2030, Mobileye could prove to be a bargain.

In short, AMD’s improvements don’t spell the doom of Intel. The management of both companies are executing on their stated operating objectives. And both stocks should perform well in the next 12 to 18 months. As to which stock is right for you? That all depends on where your allegiance is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

People are always on the lookout for the next industry Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) has in its crosshairs, and some think finance might be next. After all, Amazon stock's Chinese counterpart, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE: BABA ) spearheaded a digital finance revolution in China through its payment arm, Alipay.

Source: Shutterstock

Banks look at AMZN with a degree of trepidation; the behemoth has already disrupted everything from retail to entertainment to shipping.

When Amazon enters an industry, it moves fast and it is willing to operate at razor-thin margins to grow market share. AMZN stock takes no prisoners, and the company is responsible for much of the pain felt today by brick-and-mortar retailers such as J C Penney Company Inc (NYSE: JCP ) and Sears Holdings Corp (NASDAQ: SHLD ).

Banks know that tech companies like Amazon and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) hold some advantages. Millennials are more likely to trust tech companies than banks. Also, tech companies can operate at lower costs than banks, since they don't have branches. A McKinsey report found that the lack of branches gives fintech lenders a 400-basis-point advantage over banks. Tech giants also have lower customer acquisition costs and greater digital competency than banks.

It looks like Amazon stock is deepening its involvement in finance. AMZN already began offering loans to sellers on its online marketplace in 2012, and expanded this to eight more countries , including Germany and China, in 2015. And Amazon rolled out a payments service in 2013, which doubled in transaction value in 2016 and reached 33 million customers.

In the near-term, it looks like AMZN stock will focus on doing two things: building its payment system and cross-selling financial products from banks to its millions of users.

In the long-term, Amazon stock could end up as a major force in finance. As Huy Nguyen Trieu , a fintech expert and former Citi MD, writes: ""the tech giants such as Amazon, Google or Apple will continue their expansion into financial services and are likely to play an important role in the financial ecosystem - in the same way that Alibaba has done in China.""

The venture capitalist Alex Rampell sees Amazon succeeding in finance as well. Alphabet, Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ), earn high margins from monetizing data or selling computer products, and this might deter them from entering finance . However, AMZN stock does not fear low-margin businesses.

Will Amazon Stock Dominate the Payments Game?

Currently, Paypal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL ) dominates online payments in the United States, with 200 million active accounts worldwide. The number of PayPal users dwarfs those of Amazon Payments by a factor of six. PayPal also holds an advantage over Amazon Pay in that other retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE: WMT ) and Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT ) do not want to take Amazon Pay , fearing that the data might give Amazon a competitive advantage. PayPal, on the other hand, is just a payments service, and doesn't compete with retailers like Walmart.

Currently, Amazon and PayPal are in talks to allow users to pay with PayPal on Amazon. Amazon's competitor eBay Inc (NASDAQ: EBAY ) owned PayPal until the two split in 2015. Now, the two are free to work together.

And the two will both benefit . This would increase PayPal's presence and drive business for PayPal, which has been absent from Amazon. And infrequent AMZN users might not want to put down a credit card on the site, so adding PayPal reduces friction.

But the truce between Amazon stock and PayPal might not last forever. AMZN could license its next-generation Amazon Go store technology to brick-and-mortar retailers in exchange for them allowing Amazon Pay.

As Andrew Melville notes in Forbes:

""Few retailers, even those worried about competition from Amazon, would be able to decline a free next-generation technology that would transform the customer experience, reduce theft, and allow for major reductions in labor - the second largest expense in retail. And no payments company would be able to offer retailers anything even remotely like Amazon Go's technology.""

More grocery stores might then accept payment via Amazon Pay, helping AMZN's mobile wallet gain critical mass. And, as Alipay has shown in China, once Amazon gains ground in payments, it can build a broader internet finance ecosystem.

AMZN Stock: Opportunities for Cross-Selling Financial Products

Amazon could also partner with banks to provide its users with financial services such as loans.

Last year, AMZN partnered with Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC ) to offer student loans at discounted rates to Amazon Student Prime subscribers. Student Prime subscribers could get a 0.5% discount on loans. However, Amazon quickly ended this amid public pressure from consumer watchdogs.

This January, Amazon announced the new Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature credit card, issued through JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM ). This card gives customers 5% cashback on purchases from AMZN and eliminates fees for foreign transactions. This further encourages shopping on Amazon and makes Prime membership more attractive, while giving Chase income from transactions.

Amazon and the Banks

It looks like the relationship between AMZN stock and the banks will be complicated. In some areas, Amazon and the banks will be partners, with banks issuing financial products sold on its website to Prime subscribers. At the same time, AMZN will be a supplier to the banks, providing them with cloud services via Amazon Web Services .

In other cases, they may end up as competitors. Mobile wallets such as Amazon Pay could potentially replace credit cards, and deprive banks of payment revenues and data on customer spending patterns.

And in these partnerships, who would have the upper hand? banks or Amazon stock? Remember, AMZN would be interacting directly with customers and holding the user data.

Although the relationship between tech companies and banks is nuanced, banks still have reason to be concerned.

As of writing, Lucas Hahn did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Of course, since then Google has gone and spoiled it all by rebranding their holding company as alphabet, but the acronym has stuck.

At the risk of spoiling that alphabetic synergy I would add Apple (AAPL) to the list, given that companies role as the largest of the tech stocks. In fact some people substitute Apple for Amazon and obviously if you do that you still get FANG rather than the less appealing FAANG. For argument’s sake, let’s assume that all five stocks are still collectively known as the fang stocks, and right now they look like a good place to be.

The reason, though, is less about tech, or indeed about business at all, than it is about politics. The market seems to be driven at the moment by what comes out of the White House. Since the election there has been a lot of faith placed by traders and investors in certain policies outlined by the new administration and the Republicans who dominate Congress during the campaign; a “beautiful” replacement for Obamacare, for example, as well as tax reform and infrastructure spending.

Yesterday’s drop in the stock market, the biggest of the year so far, was reportedly triggered by worries about the healthcare bill slated to replace the Affordable Care Act. It has met with opposition from within the Republican Party, particularly from the Right, and needs some serious negotiation in order to just pass the House.

That in itself would be a bad thing if repeal went ahead without the replacement passed, as most acknowledge that something has to fill the vacuum.

More worrying for the market, though, is that if this bill fails, it will indicate that the fiscal conservatives in Congress are sticking to their principles, making stimulative infrastructure spending a virtual non-starter.

Some of the biggest losers yesterday were in the industrial and material sectors that have gained the most since the election and which would be hurt most by delays in infrastructure spending. The reason the fang stocks look so attractive right now is because policy delays regarding healthcare and infrastructure spending will have little effect on them in the short term, but things like tax reform when it does come, especially the possibility of the repatriation of overseas profits, will make an enormous difference. The consensus is that tax reform is an area that unites the party and thus could be even hastened by a split over the Obamacare replacement.

The fly in the ointment could be that much of the potential growth for these firms lies in overseas expansion, in particular to emerging economies. That would be a worry if the White House does push for more isolationist trade relationships, but again the fact that the Freedom Caucus free market types in the GOP are flexing their muscles would suggest that any eventual move would have to be negotiated, and therefore moderated from the campaign rhetoric.

All in all, then, things look good for Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google. That belief seems to have taken hold today as each of the tech big five has bucked the downward trend of the broader market and gained in early trading. Of course one swallow doth not a summer make, but the logic behind these stocks’ contrarian behavior is hard to refute and they may prove to be a hedge against politics driven uncertainty over the next few weeks, or even months.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chinese tech company Baidu Inc (ADR) (NASDAQ: BIDU ) has been called ""the Google of China,"" but BIDU stock's steady decline over the past six months suggests that the company is nowhere near comparable to Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG ,NASDAQ: GOOGL ).

Source: Shutterstock

In mid-February, BIDU looked to be on the upswing, but the firm's fourth-quarter earnings dealt a heavy blow to Baidu stock.

With BIDU shares down nearly 10% from where they were a month ago, however, this dip could translate into a buying opportunity.

Baidu Earnings

It's true that Baidu reported less-than-stellar earnings last month. The company's quarterly revenue came in a $2.6 billion, which represents a decline of more than 2% from last year's figures.

Even more concerning was the fact that online marketing customers declined 18.6% in 2016. For investors that consider BIDU to be the Chinese Google, that's a huge deal. Advertising dollars are everything to search engines like Baidu and Google.

It's Not as Bad as It Looks

Those figures are certainly scary, but when you look at the reason behind them things start to look a little bit rosier. It's important to note that BIDU faced some major headwinds last year, including a big change to China's advertising regulations. The cost to comply with the new rules was significant for Baidu, which generates around 96% of its revenue from advertising.

Not only did the new regulations hit BIDU's revenue hard, but they also hurt the firm's customers numbers. The new regulations include strict rules regarding how companies advertise and some of Baidu's current customers weren't able to meet those requirements, which resulted in a loss.

However, there could be a silver lining in there for BIDU as the new requirements will help the firm identify who its quality customers are. If you look at per-customer spend, you'll see that those who were able to meet the new guidelines actually spent about 14% more than they had in the fourth quarter of 2015.

Huge Growth Potential for BIDU Stock

What's important to note here is that even if BIDU is struggling now, there is a huge growth opportunity for internet companies in China. While you might think that a search engine doesn't have room to expand any further, keep in mind that China is pretty far behind the U.S. when it comes to internet users. Just over 50% of the nation's population has access to the internet .

That's a big deal, because it means that as the internet makes its way further afield, advertisers are going to be willing to pay to reach even more people. Eventually, online advertising will be the best way to reach the majority of Chinese residents, and marketers will have to pay for that.

Bottom Line on BIDU Stock

Not only does BIDU have a lot of growth potential in its core business, but the firm has been investing heavily in hot new technology like artificial intelligence and self-driving vehicles. While advertising revenue still makes up the bulk of Baidu's bottom line, we could see big-time benefits from the firm's focus on the future.

The company's efforts to develop self-driving technology are particularly enticing because the cars' navigation systems will be equipped to deal with China's complicated traffic conditions. That means that once the vehicles are roadworthy, tweaking their technology to make them usable on U.S. roads will be far easier than trying to do it the other way around.

BIDU's fourth-quarter results were definitely scary on the surface, but things aren't as bad as the market would have you believe. If you have ever considered buying BIDU stock, now is the time to do it.

As of this writing, Laura Hoy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Self-driving cars will begin coming to market before long.

They'll generate huge profits for some companies.

Google has been a leader in developing self-driving technology.

But does it follow that Google's parent, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , will reap the rewards of its technological leadership? Or put another way, are the potential profits from self-driving cars a reason to add Alphabet's stock to your portfolio?

A lot of commentators seem to think so, but I'm very skeptical. Here's why.

Driverless ""panda cars"" were the public face of the Google Self-Driving Car Project for several years. Image source: Alphabet.

Alphabet has what looks like a leadership position...

Google began tinkering with self-driving cars way back in 2009, long before many investors began taking the technology seriously. The original team behind what became knows as the Google Self-Driving Car Project included several robotics all-stars who seemed ready to invent the future. The whole thing appeared to be decades beyond what the established automakers were doing.

For a while, it was. Of course, in the last few years, some automakers and auto-industry suppliers have invested heavily in the technology and made significant gains. But even so, Alphabet's self-driving unit, which was spun out of Google and renamed Waymo late last year, retains some big advantages:

By at least one measure -- ""disengagements,"" the number of times a human driver has to take control of a self-driving test car -- Waymo made major progress last year and appears to be ahead of most known rivals.

Maps. The first self-driving cars to come to market will rely heavily on highly detailed maps as a backup to their sensors. Google has been mapping the world in ever-increasing detail for years; Waymo will have access to those maps, while its competitors will have to look elsewhere.

Waymo has developed its own self-driving sensor hardware, including -- crucially -- LIDAR units that cost much less than current commercially available units.

Those are significant advantages. But there's a big question that might not be obvious to investors who don't have a deep understanding of the auto industry:

How will Waymo bring all of that to market?

Waymo's current test fleet was built in partnership with FCA, but the companies have disclosed no plans to collaborate on production vehicles. Image source: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.

...but bringing it to market may prove complicated

Waymo's CEO, John Krafcik, is a respected auto-industry veteran who was hired to lead the project in September 2015. Krafcik brought a welcome dose of realistic transparency to the project when he made it clear that Alphabet has no intention of manufacturing its own vehicles. Instead, he said, Waymo would seek to bring its technology to market via partnerships with established automakers.

There's just one problem: The automakers aren't exactly beating down Krafcik's door. In fact, the auto executives I've talked with feel that they have very good reasons to steer clear of a deal with Waymo, starting with control of the data generated by self-driving cars.

It's almost an understatement to say that automakers are very aware of the smartphone precedent. The phone makers that chose to adopt the Android operating system ended up making hardware on very slim margins. Alphabet ended up with most of the profits, because Android provided it with the (immensely valuable) users' data.

Auto executives don't want to end up in the same boat, and they know that they'll soon have alternatives that will allow them to keep at least some control of the data. At least one alternative, a partnership between Delphi Automotive (NYSE: DLPH) , Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) , and Mobileye (NYSE: MBLY) , aims to have a self-driving system available to any automaker that wants it by the end of 2019. That partnership will allow automakers to retain much of the data, and auto executives see it as homegrown -- created largely by established industry suppliers, not by Silicon Valley hotshots.

Given that, why go with Waymo?

That said, a couple of big automakers have kicked the tires on Waymo's technology:

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE: FCAU) worked with Google engineers last year to create the latest vehicles for Waymo's test fleet , based on the well-regarded Chrysler Pacifica minivan -- but there's no sign that the two will move forward on anything that could lead to a product for sale.

Honda (NYSE: HMC) issued a somewhat odd announcement in December saying that it was ""entering into formal discussions"" with Waymo, though nothing (so far) seems to have resulted from those discussions. (I speculated at the time that Honda's announcement might have been about prodding other potential partners to take action . But at least as of right now, it's not clear exactly what was going on there.)

Waymo may well find a profitable line of business in selling its sensors to other companies. And it's likely that some automaker, somewhere, will eventually give its self-driving system a try.

But unless other research and development efforts hit roadblocks that Waymo is somehow able to skirt, it seems unlikely that it will be a dominant player in self-driving systems anytime in the near future.

The upshot: Don't buy Alphabet just for self-driving

There are plenty of good reasons to consider adding Alphabet to your portfolio. But if you're looking for a targeted self-driving investment, Alphabet probably isn't it: As of right now, it's not clear that Waymo will ever add much to the search giant's bottom line.

SAN FRANCISCO - Google wants to make it easier for you to find answers and recommendations on smartphones without having to think about what to ask its search engine.

Its new feature, called “shortcuts,” will appear as a row of icons below the Google search box. Where now you’d have to ponder and then speak or type a request, the shortcuts will let you tap the icons to get the latest weather, movie showtimes, sports scores, restaurant recommendations and other common requests.

The shortcuts will begin appearing Tuesday in updates to Google’s app for iPhones, Android phones and its mobile website. The Android app will also include various tools such as a currency converter, a language translator and an ATM locator, which you can also summon with a tap. Those tools may eventually make it to the iPhone as well, although Google says it doesn’t know when.

YOUR BACKUP BRAIN

These shortcuts are the latest step in Google’s quest to turn its search engine into a secondary brain that anticipates people’s needs and desires. The search engine gleans these insights by analyzing your past requests and, when you allow it, tracking your location, a practice that periodically raises privacy concerns about Google’s power to create digital profiles of its users.

Based on the knowledge that Google already has accumulated, its shortcuts feature may already list your favorite sports teams or recommend nearby restaurants serving cuisines you prefer.

Shortcuts also show how Google’s search engine has been adapting to its audience, now that smartphones have become the primary way millions or of people stay connected to the internet.

GOING MOBILE

Since more than half of requests for Google’s search engine now come from smartphones, the Mountain View, California, company has adapted its services to smaller screens, touch keyboards and apps instead of websites.

Early in that process, Google tweaked its search engine to answer many requests with factual summaries at the top of its results page, a change from simply displaying a list of links to other websites. Voice-recognition technology also allows you to speak your request into a phone instead of typing it.

The transition is going well so far. Google’s revenue rose 20 percent last year to $89 billion, propelled by digital ads served up on its search engine, YouTube and Gmail. Although shortcuts won’t initially show ads after you tap them, Google typically sells marketing space if a feature or service becomes popular.

A group representing some of the leading companies in the self-driving car sector is lobbying against a Massachusetts bill backed by General Motors, saying it could prevent technology companies from using autonomous vehicles for public uses such as ride-hailing services.

Filed by Senator Eric Lesser in January, the GM-backed bill would only let companies that have previously “manufactured and distributed motor vehicles in the United States” make self-driving technology available to the public, in applications such as ride-hailing services.

That would effectively bar Uber Technologies and other tech firms that are in the vanguard of developing self-driving vehicles from using those cars once the technology becomes commercially viable.

“The way that it defines a vehicle manufacturer is very anticompetitive,” said Chan Lieu, who is serving as a legal adviser to a coalition opposing the GM bill that includes Uber, Lyft, auto makers Ford and Volvo, and Waymo, the self-driving intiative recently spun out of Google.

“To require that the people have previous experience manufacturing vehicles in the US — we don’t understand the public policy rationale to doing that.”

Massachusetts is just one state where the group, which calls itself the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets, and GM are fighting over driverless cars. GM has supported similar legislation in other states, including Illinois and Maryland. Michigan, GM’s home state, adopted a version in 2016, but amended the bill at Google’s urging, to allow qualifying technology companies to operate self-driving vehicles for the public.

Harry Lightsey, a policy director at GM, said the company does not oppose letting technology companies offer the services. He said the company pitches legislation that favors traditional auto manufacturers as a “starting point” to make sure that the rules ensure public safety. For example, Lightsey said, GM ultimately supported the Michigan amendment because it required tech companies to conduct a certain amount of testing.

Still, the tension highlights divisions and alliances that are developing as the advent of self-driving cars bring the tech and auto industries together.

Uber and Lyft, for instance, are longtime rivals, while Google’s Waymo recently sued Uber, alleging intellectual property theft of driverless technology. GM acquired San Francisco-based autonomous vehicle software developer Cruise Automation in 2016, and is also a major investor in Lyft.

Ford and Volvo each have models that are being used by Uber in a self-driving experiment in Pittsburgh.

Eric Risberg/AP/file 2014 Google is among the companies opposing state limits on certain public uses of self-driving cars.

In an interview, Lesser, a Democrat from Longmeadow who co-chairs the Legislature’s Committee on Economic Development and Emerging Technologies acknowledged that GM approached his office about filing the Massachusetts bill.

“It’s clearly a bill that established car companies are going to like, in particular, GM,” he said.

Lesser stressed it is one of several bills filed so far this session about autonomous cars, many of which will likely evolve or be subsumed into others. Lesser said he would prefer that technology companies be allowed to operate self-driving services.

“The way it’s written is tighter, frankly, than it will probably play out,” Lesser said. “It’s not my intention, and not my desire, to do the handiwork of any one company or any one group.”

Lesser has not received campaign donations from General Motors in the past, according to state records. He has received $300 over several donations in recent years by a local lobbyist hired by GM. Employees at Uber, Lyft, and Google have contributed more to Lesser.

A similar bill was filed in the House by Representative Ann-Margaret Ferrante of Gloucester, who could not be reached for comment.

David Whiston, an analyst for Morningstar who follows GM, speculated the company is filing the legislation as a tactic to tie down competitors with political work.

“That may be all they’re doing, is trying to buy some time,” Whiston said. “It slows the tech companies down, if they have to fight the state Legislatures all the time. It’s just a big distraction for them.”

Another company that would be affected by the GM legislation is Cambridge-based startup nuTonomy Inc., which is conducting vehicle tests in South Boston and in Singapore.

Matthew Wansley, nuTonomy’s general counsel, predicts the GM legislation won’t become law. Self-driving cars, he noted, are still likely years from full commercial deployment.

“I think what’s important is to have a set of conditions for testing autonomous vehicles and ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles,” Wansley said. “If I were in the Massachusetts Legislature and was looking at a model to build out of, I wouldn’t look at these copycat bills.”

Overall, at least nine bills have been filed this session that address autonomous vehicles. Representative William Straus, who chochairs the Legislature’s transportation committee, said he expects to eventually schedule a hearing on them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(RTTNews.com) - Google said Tuesday that it is taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content. This includes removing ads more effectively from content that is attacking or harassing people based on their race, religion, gender or similar categories. This change will enable it to take action, where appropriate, on a larger set of ads and sites.

Google noted that it will also tighten safeguards to ensure that ads show up only against legitimate creators in YouTube Partner Programâ€""as opposed to those who impersonate other channels or violate community guidelines. Finally, It won't stop at taking down ads. The YouTube team is taking a hard look at existing community guidelines to determine what content is allowed on the platformâ€""not just what content can be monetized.

Google said, in the coming days and months, it is introducing new tools for advertisers to more easily and consistently manage where their ads appear across YouTube and the web.

Google will introduce new account-level controls to make it easier for advertisers to exclude specific sites and channels from all of their AdWords for Video and Google Display Network campaigns, and manage brand safety settings across all their campaigns with a push of a button.

In addition, Google noted that it will introduce new controls to make it easier for brands to exclude higher risk content and fine-tune where they want their ads to appear.

Google stated that it will offer advertisers and agencies more transparency and visibility on where their ads are running, and in the coming months it will expand availability of video-level reporting to all advertisers.

The company noted that it will be hiring significant numbers of people and developing new tools powered by our latest advancements in AI and machine learning to increase our capacity to review questionable content for advertising. In cases where advertisers find their ads were served where they shouldn't have been, the company plans to offer a new escalation path to make it easier for them to raise issues. In addition, the company said it will soon be able to resolve these cases in less than a few hours.

Philipp Schindler, Google's chief business officer, said in a blog, ""We believe the combination of these new policies and controls will significantly strengthen our ability to help advertisers reach audiences at scale, while respecting their values.""

(RTTNews.com) - Google and Jigsaw, both divisions of Alphabet Inc., on Tuesday announced the launch of a free set of tools to help election websites, human rights groups, and news sites to defend their computer systems from cyber attacks.

A Jigsaw said its free suite of security tools called Protect Your Election will help upcoming national elections in France, South Korea and Germany, then subsequent elections as they occur.

Jigsaw's Protect Your Election suite of tools include mostly existing tools-- Project Shield, Password Alert and 2-Step Verification.

Password Alert is software that helps detect and warn users about a phishing attempt. A phishing attack is when someone tries to trick you into sharing personal information online.

2-Step Verification helps strengthen up security beyond passwords by requiring a second access code, such as a text sent to a cellphone or a security key.

This podcast was recorded on March 16, 2017.

Sean O'Reilly: So, while you're down there at South by Southwest, what did you learn about this possible use of the future?

Simon Erickson: It's, I think, the natural next step that we're going to have self-driving fleets instead of just self-driving cars. If you're driving to work and leaving your car in a parking garage all day, you're really not getting the benefits of it being able to navigate and drive itself. They're really meant to be used to be driving all day long. And when you do that, you get a higher utilization out of the vehicle, and that really brings the cost of them down. And you have powerful things behind the scenes. You have neural networks, and all the chips that aren't really cheap. This is really the way that these are meant to be used, to be in fleets. Uber and Hertz and all the large fleets and self-driving taxis are really aiming to do this. As far as South by Southwest, you were asking some of the things we learned, we found out that about half the world's population is in cities today, and that's going to grow to about two-thirds by 2050. So, we're going to be moving from about 3.5 billion people in cities today to 7 billion within the next 30 years or so. And you can't just keep building out more and more suburbs and highways and parking garages as infrastructure to have this many people moving into the cities. It needs to be a better-designed city. And I think we're going to see self-driving cars play a key role in how cities are actually designing themselves to accommodate for the population boom.

O'Reilly: Yeah, I remember another Fool, Armun Asgari, he had that piece back in October, The Race to Autonomy: An Investor's Guide to Self-Driving Cars . It's a bit of a read, but it was awesome. And one of the things that it's common sense that he points out is, the average American family owns 2.2 cars, and it's a $30,000-$50,000 asset that is rapidly depreciating. Wouldn't it be nice to get some use out of that? Wouldn't it be nice if our cities weren't just these monoliths of concrete to park these things that aren't being used 95% of the time? Did you see anything hard or tangible down at the conference there, on this trend?

Erickson: There were sessions. It was more academic, as far as what we had seen at South by Southwest. In terms of use cases, though, I think Singapore is one that we can keep an eye on, if you want to see this in action right now. Singapore, of course, is a city that likes to monitor everything. There's no littering there. They're really cracking down on only smoking in certain areas. It's a very oversight city, so, they're really ahead of the curve on monitoring things. Even today, Sean, they have their analog for Uber. It's a company called Grab, who's teamed up with another company called NuTonomy that's already got self-driving cars navigating around the city, picking people up, basically a taxi service that is happening right now. There is an engineer in the passenger seat just for the peace of mind for the riders. But they're planning to have 100 driverless cars within the next year. This is something that's already happening out there -- you can actually get into a car that's navigating itself to the location for you.

O'Reilly: Throughout Singapore, yeah. Can I ask what kind of car is it? I know that Uber was testing driverless cars in Pittsburgh, and I believe they were Volvo crossover SUVs or something. Do you know any of that stuff off the top of your head?

Erickson: Yeah, it is Volvo for the U.S. for Uber for self-driving cars. There's also a company called Otto for self-driving trucks, which could be for transport.

O'Reilly: Wow. I have to go to my local Volvo dealership and see if they have an engineer sitting around that can take me out on one of these things.

Erickson: I have a crazy futuristic idea for you, also.

O'Reilly: Is this better than the driverless luggage?

Erickson: It is. And you knew, when you invited me on the show, being an Explorer , futuristic kind of guy, that I was going to have to throw some ideas like this to you, right?

O'Reilly: I'm all ears.

Erickson: The economics are such that the average taxi fare, in the U.S., is charging about $3.50 a mile. Pretty expensive. And it's generally accepted that by 2021, when we're expecting autonomous vehicles to really start going mainstream, that the cost of an autonomous car will cost in the neighborhood of $0.30 a mile. Less than a tenth of the cost today. Now, when you get to that kind of price point, Sean, that opens up a lot of options of who is actually paying $0.30 a mile per trip for customers. And the idea would be, this can be subsidized by advertising companies like Google, where you can get into an autonomous car. Yeah. Get in for a free ride. It'll bring you within a 10-mile radius, or whatever the distance would be. It'll cost Google maybe $3 for your trip, at $0.30 a mile. But in exchange, they have your undivided attention that they can serve you ads in the car.

O'Reilly: Oh, my gosh. I mean, I would obviously just look at my phone or read a book. But that's awesome.

Erickson: Yeah, especially when you consider the numbers that you threw out earlier. The average American is spending a third of their household income every year on these rapidly depreciating assets that we call cars. It doesn't have to be that way when you start getting into the discussion of $0.30 a mile.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

In the face of falling sales and profits, the luxury watchmaker is attempting to adapt its business to the rapid growth of e-commerce.

Movado Group results: The raw numbers

Metric Q4 2017 Q4 2016 Year-Over-Year Change Sales $130.785 million $143.264 million (8.7%) Net income $5.232 million $7.888 million (33.7%) Earnings per share $0.22 $0.34 (35.3%)

What happened with Movado Group this quarter?

Net sales fell 8.7% year over year to $130.8 million, and 7.5% on a constant dollar basis, as Movado continues to be negatively impacted by the struggles of department stores and other traditional retailers. ""We are seeing a significant shift from brick and mortar to e-commerce and a continuing challenged fashion watch market in the United States,"" said Chairman and CEO Efraim Grinberg in a press release.

Gross profit declined 14% to $64.7 million, with gross margin falling to 49.5% compared to 52.6% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Lower sales also dented operating income, which dropped 36% to $7.4 million. All told, net income tumbled 34% to $5.2 million, and earnings per share decreased 35% to $0.22.

Looking forward

In response to this challenging retail environment, Movado is implementing multiple cost-saving initiatives and devoting more resources to its e-commerce business. ""Given the evolution of the retail market place, we are consolidating certain operations and shifting a greater portion of our investment into the continued development and growth of our digital footprint, including allocating a larger percentage of our marketing budget to online venues,"" said Grinberg.

""We are fully committed in our investments in digital and are very pleased with the multiple initiatives underway,"" added President Ricardo Quintero during a conference call with analysts. ""Movado.com was our fastest-growing business unit with double-digit increases and our digital advertising and social media footprint continues to grow and gain traction.""

To further adapt to changing consumer preferences, Movado is also expanding its lineup of smartwatches by partnering with Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary Google. ""While we believe in the continued growth potential of the traditional watch category, we are also excited about our recently announced partnership with Google to launch a new smartwatch collection, Movado Connect,"" Grinberg said.

Still, Movado is reducing its workforce in an attempt to cut operating costs by $12 million in fiscal 2018 and $15 million annually thereafter. The company expects to record a pre-tax charge of approximately $7 million to $10 million related to these initiatives, mostly in the first quarter. ""We are decisive in our commitment to become a leaner, more agile organization, rightsized to the current operating environment and making smart resource allocations against the biggest opportunities with a focus on delivering sustainable, profitable growth in the long run,"" Quintero said .

In all, Movado's fiscal 2018 full-year outlook includes:

Net sales in a range of $515 million to $530 million.

Operating income of $50 million to $55 million.

Net income of $33 million to $36.3 million, or $1.40 to $1.55 per share.

""Looking into fiscal 2018, we continue to believe there are many opportunities in the watch category,"" added Quintero. ""Innovation is the lifeline of our business and we are committed to continuing to lead, with superior watch design in the traditional watch category as well as in the connected segment.""

Maybe it's due to fear of a sector that, as a whole, is often considered to be higher risk than other, less dynamic industries. But there are a select few companies that, thanks to their dominant competitive advantages, offer an excellent low-risk way for investors to profit from emerging technologies. Read on to learn about one of the best.

All hail the king

Few businesses are as dominant within their respective industries as Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) . The parent company of Google gives investors an opportunity beyond a core Internet search business that legendary investor Charlie Munger once described as having the largest competitive moat he's ever seen.

With a more than 90% share of the global search engine market, Google is the undisputed king of search. Yet it refuses to grow complacent; it's constantly expanding its reach with an ever-growing array of services. It now possesses an incredible collection of platforms that serve more than 1 billion users each, including YouTube, Android, Chrome, Gmail, Maps, Google Play, and now Google Cloud . Together, they serve to expand and strengthen Google's powerful ecosystem and widen its competitive moat.

Moreover, Google generates enormous amounts of cash, to the tune of nearly $26 billion in 2016, which it has used to build a fortress-like balance sheet with more than $86 billion in cash and less than $4 billion in debt. This financial strength allows it to invest aggressively in research and development, and in the acquisition of companies that are leading the way in important new technologies. All of this, combined with Google's renowned culture of innovation, helps it remain at the forefront of technological change.

Other bets

It's this innovation that necessitated its reorganization into its current "" Alphabet "" structure. The design is brilliant, as it sends a clear message about what the company has become: a collection of businesses with investments in a far-ranging array of exciting technologies that are poised to pay increasing returns to shareholders in the years ahead.

Alphabet's holding company structure allows disparate businesses -- such as self-driving technology leader Waymo , life sciences company Verily , and connected home device maker Nest -- to be run and scaled independently. Management believes this will give these ""other bets"" their best chance at receiving the resources and attention they need to succeed over the long term.

Alphabet therefore gives investors many ways to win. The company's core Google business is as dominant as they come, which helps to lower Alphabet's overall risk profile. And the company's other bets have in many ways become analogous to an emerging technology fund overseen by two of the greatest minds on the planet: co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. It's the perfect balance of market dominance and optionality; cash flow and reinvestment opportunity; current success and future growth potential.

Valuation

At first glance, Alphabet's forward price-to-earnings ratio in the low 20's may seem a bit expensive compared to the S&P 500's forward P/E of about 18. But if you adjust for the more than $82 billion in net cash it has on its balance sheet -- which equates to about $119 per share -- Alphabet's ex-cash P/E drops to less than 19. On that basis, Alphabet's stock is quite a bargain, especially considering its superior growth rates compared to the market as a whole.

Moreover, investors who buy shares today will be buying alongside Alphabet itself. The company has a $7 billion share repurchase program currently under way -- a figure that's likely to continue to grow along with Alphabet's ever rising cash flows. These share buybacks should further help to support Alphabet's stock price, and they signal management's increasing willingness to return capital to shareholders.

All told, Alphabet offers retirees an excellent and relatively low-risk way to profit from emerging technologies -- a high potential field that's often underrepresented in retirement portfolios.

While self-driving technology is getting more advanced every year and not only the automotive industry, but even the technology industry is interested in it, the legal framework for self-driving technology hasn’t matched up yet. Google parent Alphabet Inc. has reportedly appointed Tekedra Mawakana as its new vice president of public policy and government affairs to help navigate the tumultuous government policy on the subject.

“As we take fully self-driving cars to the roads, Tekedra will work with policymakers at all levels to realize the enormous safety, mobility and economic benefits of this technology,” John Krafcik, CEO, Waymo, Google's self-driving project, told Recode on Monday.

Mawakana has experience in handling government policy affairs at various companies. Prior to the reported new employment, she was the vice president of government policy at eBay and before that, she served as Yahoo’s deputy general counsel and held key policy positions at AOL.

Mawakana’s hire has come at a time when Google plans to sue Uber over stealing one of its designs via the company’s former engineer, Anthony Levandowski. She would, however, be focused on handling government policy rather than private litigation.

Google’s self-driving project has been in the works ever since it was first showcased at the Google I/O 2011. The company seems to have taken a different approach to self-driving technology compared to Uber. Unlike the ride-sharing company, which fought with the California department of motor vehicles and then had to finally bow down to government regulation, Google seems to be focused on navigating the legal hurdles to self-driving policy rather than fighting them.

Policy on self-driving is slowly gaining the attention of lawmakers. While four states, Georgia, Maryland, Illinois and Tennessee, are in discussion on putting restrictions on self-driving vehicles, the new federal administration under President Donald Trump seems keen on the technology, according to the report.

The federal secretary of transportation had announced post Trump’s Senate confirmation that the new administration will review former President Barack Obama’s administration’s guidelines and make changes after consulting with tech and auto companies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He added that, as far as placing advertisements was concerned, they have to be held to the same standards as traditional media organizations.

Another concern is that sometimes advertisements are automatically placed alongside objectionable and inappropriate content within those platforms that brands do not have control over.

""The big issue for Google and Facebook is whether they are going to have human editing at this point ... of course they have the profitability. They have the margins to enable them to do it. And this is going to be the big issue — how far are they prepared to go?"" Sorrell said, adding they needed to go ""significantly far"" to arrest these concerns.

A failure to address such issues could see Facebook and Google potentially take hits on ad revenue if brands stop advertising on their platforms. For example, French advertising firm Havas recently pulled all its ad spend from Google and its video platform, YouTube.

The Guardian reported that Havas took the step after talks with Google broke down because the tech giant couldn't provide specific reassurances, policy and guarantees over the filtering and classification of video or display content.

Havas' decision came after the UK government joined organizations including the Guardian, BBC and Transport for London in pulling advertising from Google and YouTube, the Guardian report said.

Sorrell said blanket withdrawals from advertisers across these digital platforms will not solve the problem. Instead, he urged for greater cooperation with the tech giants.

""I think the most constructive way of doing it is getting Google and Facebook to understand the problem, which I think they do, and to get them to step up to control it just like any other media right now would in a traditional sense,"" he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even so, the company’s actions around harmful and dishonest items attacking the reputations of individuals and organizations continue to be mystifyingly inconsistent.

In this column, I’ll share some facts and thoughts on how defamation victims should proceed given the current environment.

Before I start, let me first take a moment to disclose that I work in the online reputation management field. In my previous article on this subject, one online pundit claimed that I’d failed to disclose that I do so “in the normal place for such disclaimers,” though I mentioned working on such cases in the text of the column.

While this critic did not point out anything that I had written that was erroneous, he implied that my points should be either discounted or suspect because I work to help people manage and repair their reputations online.

Actually, despite my somewhat passionate railing against Google on behalf of online defamation victims in that earlier article, I stand to profit if Google halts removals because my firm makes money by helping people manage their online reputations using search engine optimization (SEO) and other tactics that aren’t necessary when removals occur.

The background on the freeze

As I outlined a little over a month back, Google essentially halted processing of defamation removal requests, even when accompanied by duly executed court orders specifying URLs containing defamatory content.

I learned this by polling a number of the attorneys across the US that specialize in defamation cases and using court orders establishing content as defamatory as a means of petitioning Google to remove the URLs from their search results. For perhaps as long as a decade now, this process has provided relief to people who really had no other options for removing damaging and untrue representations about themselves from highly-prominent visibility.

According to the attorneys I polled (some of whom showed me communications directly from Google), at that time, Google had largely suspended all new removal requests.

Google thaws. A little.

Since writing that article, there seems to have been a slight thawing on the part of Google’s removal evaluation team. Attorneys are now reporting that a few requests are now being acted upon — some of which were previously denied by Google.

Unfortunately, other requests are still being declined, and Google continues to refuse to communicate what they will or will not do, or why they previously denied some requests and then subsequently elected to fulfill them.

Here are just a few examples of cases these attorneys told me about in which Google has declined to act:

A company spent two years and several hundred thousand dollars pursuing a court order establishing defamation on a Ripoff Report Page in order to petition Google to remove the URL.

A real estate agent was defamed and harassed for months via weekly posts by a person in a dispute with them over rent payments. These posts falsely accused the real estate agent of being a criminal, and the defendant made other misrepresentations via online reviews. The real estate agent sued in a typical court process that was pending for over a year, and it was established that the IP address responsible for the defamatory content was connected with the defamer. Subpoenas had been issued, but before records were received, the defendant admitted to posting the content, and, on this basis, a court order was obtained identifying the material as defamatory. Google initially agreed to remove the URLs, but some were not removed due to a clerical error wherein a character was missing from the links. After this error was pointed out, and after months of communications, Google then requested more information to prove the defendant wrote the items. Eventually, Google denied the removal request despite both the attorneys for the plaintiff and the defendant repeatedly offering to provide additional information. Subsequently, Google reinstated the links they had earlier removed.

An ALS charity and its founder were attacked online by someone who had a personal grievance against the founder. Though the postings did not directly allege any malfeasance on the part of the charity, its reputation, along with the founder’s, has been damaged. The charity, which has helped many people afflicted with ALS in the past 10 years, continues to be impacted by the defamatory content — likely damaging its fundraising and therefore indirectly keeping needed assistance from people suffering from ALS and their families.

A company, its owner and the owner’s wife were defamed by a disgruntled investor who hid their identity and published websites, YouTube videos and a Ripoff Report. The attorneys for the harmed parties discovered who posted the information by obtaining the person’s IP address information, then sued the defamer and obtained a court order. When the removal request was initially submitted, Google denied it with no explanation. Then, when it was resubmitted, Google requested further evidence proving the defendant had been properly served notice, which was done in person via a court process server. Then, Google demanded evidence that the defendant wrote the Ripoff Report content, since the defendant had removed all of the other items. The attorneys provided the IP evidence from both the Ripoff Report and a YouTube video that was subject to the court order — both showed the same user’s email address and the IP address that was used. Google then summarily denied the request without any explanation.

For a look at the other side of the coin — requests with which Google complies — we can examine yet another case. In this instance, a woman was defamed and cast in a false light by someone who posted on numerous URLs accusing her of having an affair with the accuser’s husband, in some cases even sharing a photo of the woman. Google previously had denied the removal request, and then in mid-February, agreed to remove most of the content specified. Postings that Google agreed to remove from its results included posts on Ripoff Report, Pissed Consumer and USAComplaints.com.

Confusion makes decision-making in such cases very difficult

For defamation victims and attorneys that represent them, this situation continues to be confusing and upsetting. Without some sort of consistency, it is quite difficult to determine whether it will be advisable to undertake expensive litigation proceedings.

Imagine someone has anonymously vilified you or your business online, with dozens, hundreds or even thousands of items published that misrepresent you. The legal process to handle the issue goes something like this:

You must go before a court to obtain a subpoena to get information from the publisher. That information may not identify the person doing the posting, so you may have to go back before the judge to obtain a subpoena for the ISP that operates the IP address associated with the content creator. You discover the person connected with the IP address, and then you take them to court to establish that they harmed you with false representations. Once you obtain an injunction to stop them from continuing to defame you, and a court order establishing the things they posted were false and defamatory, you then take it to the websites and to Google and ask them to remove these items. Some websites are outside of US jurisdiction and will simply ignore you. Other sites, like Ripoff Report, opt to do nothing because US law doesn’t require it. And Google may or may not decide to remove the URLs.

You may have spent tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of dollars, to obtain relief at this point, only to be denied by Google without receiving any explanation.

As I explained in the previous article, one can see why Google chooses to perform some assessment of the removal requests they receive to ensure everything is valid, and because there have apparently been cases of fraud perpetrated on the courts, Google seems to be performing an audit of each court order to determine whether those accused of defamation have been adequately identified and notified of court proceedings, whether the identified prohibited content is residing at URLs identified in court orders, and more.

In my opinion, Google would be better off leaving such issues to the courts — which should be verifying these things during the process. Meanwhile, the persons who have perpetrated fraud upon the courts should be held accountable and face criminal charges. But the actions of a few bad apples shouldn’t be allowed to spoil the barrel for everyone.

One may understand Google’s reticence in disclosing certain secrets. The company’s search engine algorithms, for example, are trade secrets. But the process and policies for evaluating legal requests are arguably an entirely different matter — a matter in which Google professes the desire for transparency by issuing regular “Transparency Reports.” To be fully transparent, Google ought to clearly communicate what criteria they will base their decisions upon. As one attorney specialized in defamation cases told Google, individuals can lose their businesses, their careers, and ultimately, their lives due to online reputation attacks.

Yes, there are legitimate free speech issues that sometimes come into play, as well as the previously mentioned fraud against the courts, but the little guys with comparably far fewer resources are the underdog victims in need of advocates in this matter. US laws that allow many websites to distribute content without having the responsibility to remove defamation — specifically Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act — have created a situation where many individuals and businesses are harmed, with zero recourse.

There were reasonable means of obtaining relief via legal process prior to the growth of the internet which do not seem to have been preserved in the virtual space. Google’s policy of acting upon defamation removals in the past has been something of a relief-valve on the situation, but, now that it is undependable, it may create a groundswell of support for pushing some legislative or judicial adjustment.

What should victims do now?

As you can see from the descriptions of some cases outlined above, your situation may be very compelling, and it may be supported by a clean and valid legal process with clear-cut proof, but all that may not be sufficient to guarantee that Google will remove the links to defamatory content.

If you’ve already been denied by Google in recent months, you may continue to periodically petition them to reconsider and try to provide any materials possible to demonstrate that you followed proper processes and have established the damaging material should not be allowed to stand.

If you have not yet gone through a lawsuit to obtain a court order for defamatory content, you need to realize that your chances of success may be limited at this time if the content is posted on a site that will obstinately refuse to remove it. If you’re dealing with ISPs and websites that are not protected by Section 230, or which are directly responsible for the content, you might be able to get the stuff removed at the source and ask Google to update its crawl and remove the no-longer-existent URLs from search.

It’s clear that this situation is still evolving. Defamation victims may still get relief through the legal process, and it may be worthwhile to start your journey toward getting a court order now, since litigation often requires months to get to the goal line, and there are statutes of limitation involved.

Consult with your attorney to determine the relative merits and potential of success for your specific case.

As this situation evolves, perhaps things will stabilize once more, one way or another. Until then, just realize that you are rolling the dice if you move forward with a suit.

As many readers are probably aware, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) search queries are often leading indicators for a variety of social and economic conditions. The volume of simple queries like ""claim unemployment"" or ""flu symptoms"" can indicate overall and geographic trends much more quickly than traditional methods of statistical collection.

In this article, I look at what Google Trends reveals about Herbalife (NYSE:HLF) in general, with a particular emphasis on the US. All charts and graphs in this article are generated from data provided by Google Trends and available to anyone that is interested.

Before we proceed to look at Herbalife let me first establish a track record on behalf of Google Trends. For our first example, we look at two large retailers, Sears (NASDAQ:SHLD) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT). Back in 2004 the level of public interest in these two companies was quite comparable.

I doubt anyone in the US is surprised by the general trends in this chart. The large spikes represent the Thanksgiving to Christmas period, the smaller spikes are back to school.

In the second case, we mix our metaphors and see how the fortunes of Budweiser, the ""King of Beers"", are waning while its darker, bitter second cousin, the India Pale Ale (ipa) are on the ascent. The spikes on the Budweiser line are what happens when you advertise, especially during the Superbowl.

The two most important lessons from these charts are:

Upward trendline = Good Downward trendline = Bad

None of these trends are surprising but they illustrate a very important point, that trends in public interest on Google search terms are an accurate proxy for the ascendancy or decline of the companies or brands they represent. Read Appendix 1 for a brief explanation of how to interpret the charts.

Section 1 - Herbalife Trends

Now let us go back to Herbalife and see what Google Trends reveals about the public interest in the word ""Herbalife"". This graph has been formatted using Excel to incorporate Worldwide and US interest in the word ""Herbalife"" into the same graph.

The chart shows a clear pattern of increasing public interest in the term ""Herbalife"" leading up to 2014 and a slow decline since then. Note: The peak interest in Herbalife occurred in March of 2014 when the FTC investigation was announced.

Clearly one off events such as news (good or bad), viral events, marketing campaigns etc. can increase public interest. Thus, I believe the troughs are a better overall indicator in identifying changing fortunes in this case. Whichever method you choose the trend is clear and undeniable.

Herbalife Brand Awareness

Some may say brand awareness of Herbalife on the internet is not particularly relevant because it's a word of mouth, family and friends type of business. To that I say baloney, and here is why.

Look at this chart of interest in Avon (NYSE:), the biggest public MLM of them all. Notice the uptrend until late 2010 and a steady decline since then.

Now compare the above chart to the annual revenue chart for Avon. Avon's peak revenue occurs in FY 2011 and subsequently enters a downward trajectory which has yet to be halted.

To be clear, internet searches are not themselves the leading edge of a trend. Rather they reflect the sum of all factors such as news, economics, marketing, pricing, social media, fads, seasonality, unemployment, demographics, reputation, advertising, lifestyle trends, competition etc. expressed as the answer to one simple question. Are people more interested or less interested in a topic over time?

In 2016 internet advertisers spent $195 billion with one goal in mind, to increase awareness of and interest in their brand or products, all in the hope of increasing future sales. Although Herbalife doesn't advertise directly on the Internet, they do spend about $70 million a year, primarily on sports sponsorships, to get the name ""Herbalife"" in front of the public. Where would a curious potential customer turn to find out more about Herbalife? The internet of course and probably Google search.

Internet interest in a product or brand is an important factor in evaluating future sales trends, regardless of whether those products are sold in retail, on the internet or via an MLM network.

Section 2 - Herbalife Buyers

Studies show that around 90% of consumers turn to the internet to perform product research and read reviews on items they are interested in purchasing. So, it is no surprise that ""Herbalife reviews"" is the most common ""Herbalife something"" query suggested by Google.

The chart below shows the level of interest in this query over the past three years within the US.

Since the peak of Herbalife revenue in 2014 the number of people in the US looking for reviews of Herbalife products has dropped significantly each successive year. The first two months of 2017 show a continuation of the same pattern of decline.

It is worth noting the large impact that dieting has on these results. A Google Trends chart for ""diet"" or ""weight loss"" shows a very similar annual trend, a surge in late December\early January and then a decline through the remainder of the year.

One trending query suggested by Google Trends related to ""Herbalife"" is the phrase ""does Herbalife work"". A very reasonable question for a potential buyer to ask.

The fact that less people asking whether Herbalife products work surely cannot be a positive for the company.

Perhaps the starkest indicator of the public interest in consuming Herbalife products is the term ""buy Herbalife"".

Again, we see the same trend that we have seen in numerous other charts, a general decline in interest since the peak in 2014.

Perhaps the issue lies with an ineffective network of Herbalife Distributors? As the chart below demonstrates, interest among members of the public who bypass the distributor network entirely have also cumulatively declined since 2014.

The US public may have declining interest in Herbalife but what about Herbalife Members? Well, to buy Herbalife products, members logon to myherbalife.com to place their orders. Fortunately, Google Chrome treats the address bar just like the Google search box so we can take a closer look.

Clearly US interest in ""myherbalife.com"", ""myherbalife"" and ""my herbalife"" shows a cumulative downward trend. For reference the red 100% peak is Oct 2014.

All these different indicators pointing towards falling sales in the US begs the question, if interest in the US for consuming Herbalife products has been going down since 2014, why is it not reflected in the Volume Points for North America.

Year Volume Points (000's) 2013 1,250 2014 1,244 2015 1,156 2016 1,248

Ackman would say that you don't need consumer interest, just enough Herbalife distributors stockpiling product. I can't imagine what explanation Herbalife might offer to address this obvious contradiction, but with a 90% annual churn rate it's not due to a loyal customer base.

Section 3 - Herbalife Sellers

Herbalife claims that 86% of their members join primarily for the 25% discount they can obtain on the products. This leaves 14% that would join to become distributors and pursue the business opportunity. However, the graph below tells a different story.

In fact, members of the US public express interest in the term ""Herbalife distributor"" at a much higher rate than they do for the term ""Herbalife discount"" or ""buy Herbalife"".

Furthermore, the next chart indicates that there are more people interested in selling Herbalife products (at least in English speaking countries) than in buying them.

The same query for Tupperware (a public MLM) demonstrates a much healthier situation where interest in buying Tupperware is the dominant trend (although entering a decline in English speaking countries!) and selling Tupperware is significantly lower.

If selling Herbalife were an easy and lucrative business it would be easy to understand the relatively high level of public interest, but we know this is not the case as a typical distributor only makes a few hundred dollars a year.

Can a business be healthy and sustainable when there are more members of the public interested in selling your product to someone else than buying it for themselves?

Herbalife Business Opportunity

As we have seen there is relatively strong interest expressed in the term ""Herbalife distributor"" within the US, and we can assume this is a common query for those interested in pursuing the business opportunity. The chart below shows how this has changed over time in the US.

Let's take a closer look at US public interest in the term ""Herbalife distributor"" over the last few years.

Again, we see a similar downward trend with each passing year. The degree to which this decline was a response to the FTC investigation announced in March of 2014 is unknown, but it must certainly be a contributing factor.

Note: the peak interest in the term ""Herbalife distributor"" was registered in August of 2013. This chart only shows years 2014 - 2017.

Section 4 - Herbalife Brand Depth

Thus far the term ""Herbalife"" has been used as a proxy for the products it sells. Some might argue that people will search for product names, rather than the name of the company, so lets take a look at that. The following chart compares US interest in the term ""Herbalife"" with several of its most popular products, several of which are uniquely named and trademarked.

As you can see, searches by product name are miniscule relative to searches for the term ""Herbalife"". So much so that the lines don't register on the chart in some cases.

Even though Herbalife product names are relatively weak compared to the overall Herbalife name, perhaps they are on the ascent. A closer look at the US interest in several unique Herbalife product names shows how they have fared over time.

Across these two charts we can see declining US interest in ""Herbalife formula 1"", ""Herbalife 24"", ""Aminogen"" and ""Niteworks"" with only ""Prolessa"" being relatively steady, since 2014.

Section 5 - Herbalife Brazil

In the Q4 conference call Herbalife specifically identified Brazil, the worlds 9th largest economy, as one area of weakness. To place the situation in a more positive light CEO Michael Johnson said this.

""In Brazil, we're ushering in business changes to focus our distributors on daily consumption and other methods that we expect will enable more sustainable customer growth.""

However, Brazilian public interest in the term ""Herbalife"" continues to drop. The green markers indicate January of each year, typically the month with the highest levels of interest.

While Michael Johnson is using terms like ""enable more sustainable customer growth"" to generate investor optimism a more honest assessment of the chart says the Brazilian public has shown no sign of increased interest in ""Herbalife"" and therefore the situation looks likely to deteriorate further in 2017.

Later in the 2016 Q4 Conference call Michael Johnson went on to assert that the underlying problem is the Brazilian economy.

""However, we face a particularly challenging Brazilian economy and a unique challenge in consumer credit that is affecting many companies.""

But an analysis of Google Trends tells a different story. The chart below shows Brazilian public interest in the terms ""Herbalife"" and ""Tupperware"" over the last 5 years.

Despite the countries economic woes, interest in ""Tupperware"" continues to increase steadily.

The Tupperware Q4 press release had this to say about Brazil.

""Brazil was up 57% in dollars and 32% in local currency, reflecting higher volume from a 20% advantage in total sellers with increased productivity in connection with sales force additions and onboarding, and effective merchandising and marketing campaigns.""

Wait a minute! One MLM is seeing over 30% growth in Brazil while another MLM is citing poor economic conditions as the primary reason for their decreasing sales. We need a tie-breaker, so lets take a look at public interest in Avon.

As you can see, interest in Avon is relatively steady within Brazil, this is confirmed by the Avon Q4 Conference call.

""Starting with Brazil, our largest market. In the fourth quarter, Brazil continued to post strong growth, delivering 7% revenue growth in local currency, driven primarily by higher average order.""

Arguably Herbalife products are closer to being a necessity (a meal replacement) than those of Tupperware or Avon, so they should be more resilient to weakening economic conditions.

I don't know which is more concerning, that Herbalife management does not grasp the true nature of their decline in Brazil, or that they do grasp it and choose to mislead investors.

After a softer than expected 2016 Q3, China saw a precipitous 11.7% Y/Y drop in their 2016 Q4 business. Management states the problem to be a shift in distributor behavior away from personal networking towards social media. Time will tell whether their China diagnosis proves to be accurate, but given their misread of Brazil, I have my doubts. Unfortunately, because Google has no presence in China, further analysis is not available.

Appendix 1 - A Quick Word About Google Trends Data

Google Trends looks at the period requested and finds the single highest value, this represents the 100% mark. All other points on the chart are marked as percentages of that peak. Therefore, a peak of 100% does represent twice as many queries as a value of 50%.

In a comparison chart, such as Budweiser vs IPA, Google Trends takes the single highest value of either of these terms which becomes the 100% mark. Therefore, we can make accurate relative comparisons between the two terms and say conclusively, for example, that in January of 2017 the US public was twice as interested in ""IPA"" as they were in ""Budweiser"".

In cases where I have used Excel to combine results from multiple geographic regions each data point within a given country is only relative to the other data points within that country. We cannot make comparative statements between countries, only the trends between the countries are important, i.e. rising or falling.

Appendix 2 - A Note from the Author

This is my third article on Herbalife, you can find my others here and here. I know from experience that I will (again) be accused of being a paid shill, working on behalf of Ackman to bring down a great company. So, let me state categorically that the idea for this article is mine alone. I have no connection, allegiance, communication or affiliation with Ackman or any of his representatives, either in the past or the present. My only financial compensation for this article is the paltry amount that I receive from SeekingAlpha.

I do have a small short position in HLF (Jan 2018 Puts) which I took out on 3/9/2017, a few days before news of the Icahn purchase hit the news. As I have said in my past articles, investing in Herbalife is more of a gamble than an investment, but I believe the odds are in my favor. In my opinion, the real value of Herbalife can only be revealed by resolution of the following factors:

Icahn makes a bid to buy the company. Icahn exits his position in a substantial way. Ackman closes or vastly reduces his short position. The uncertainty surrounding the future prospects of the US and Chinese markets is removed.

While Icahn holds the trump card of time over Ackman. Time holds the ultimate trump card over Icahn.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deep learning machines have been generating incredible amounts of buzz in recent months. Their extensive abilities can allow them to play video games, recognize faces, and, most importantly, learn. However, these systems learn 10 times more slowly than humans, which has allowed us to keep the creeping fears of a complete artificial intelligence (AI) takeover at bay. Now, Google has developed an AI that is capable of learning almost as quickly as a human being.

Claims of this advancement in speed come from Google’s DeepMind subsidiary in London. They say that not only can their machine assimilate and act on new experiences much more quickly than previous AI models, it will soon reach human-level speeds.

Their method mimics the processes of learning that occur in human and animal brains.

If you’re unfamiliar with how deep learning works, it uses layers of neural networks to locate trends or patterns in data. If one layer identifies a pattern, that information will be sent to the next layer. This process continues until all the information is collected.

Systems can be taught to learn differently depending on many different variables, such as the strength of the connection between layers. Significant changes in one layer can dramatically change how information is transmitted in other layers, or how it is “learned.” Deep neural networks have many layers, so when changes are present, the process of learning can take an incredibly long time.

However, Alexander Pritzel, one of the researchers at Google DeepMind, and his colleagues seem to have figured out a way around this issue. They call it “neural episodic control.”

“Neural episodic control demonstrates dramatic improvements on the speed of learning for a wide range of environments,” the team told MIT Technology Review. “Critically, our agent is able to rapidly latch onto highly successful strategies as soon as they are experienced, instead of waiting for many steps of optimization.” Their method mimics the processes of learning that occur in human and animal brains, replicating what happens first in the prefrontal cortex and then, as a backup, in the hippocampus.

Finding the Future

It seems as though every day some new development in AI technology is being revealed to the world. From altruistic robot lawyers to predictions about the singularity, AI technology has been barreling forward. However, we have not yet reached “true AI.” No robots exist whose AI capacity matches the intelligence of the human brain.

And so, while the realities of job loss as a result of automation and AI are becoming clearer every day, a “true AI” is not predicted to arrive any time soon. However, this development from DeepMind could be a huge stepping stone on the path to that future.

While that might seem like a science fiction nightmare on its surface, the possible benefits are enormous. Applications for advanced AI technology range from health and medicine to agriculture and even scientific research. As AI gets better at learning, it can be taught more and more ways to improve our lives.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(RTTNews.com) - Google has announced it will bring changes to its advertising policies after several major firms and government agencies pulled ads from the platform because they appeared alongside offensive extremist content on its YouTube site.

Google's European chief Matthew Brittin apologized to the firms and agencies and promised to review the firm's policies and strengthen enforcement.

Marks and Spencer became the latest firm to pull its online ads over the issue, joining others such as Audi, RBS and L'Oreal. The UK government and The Guardian had also pulled ads from the video site.

Google has announced that it would give clients more control over where their ads appear on both YouTube and the Google Display Network.

Jones, hired just six months ago, was the second-highest ranking executive at Uber after CEO and founder Travis Kalanick. His decision to leave Uber follows the departure of two other Uber executives in recent weeks, and a growing list of scandals and challenges that calls into question when -- or whether -- Silicon Valley's most valuable private company will be able to go public.

The challenges facing Uber include an important lawsuit over its self-driving technology. Image source: Uber Technologies.

Two explanations for Jones's departure

Why Jones left depends on who you ask.

If you ask Uber, or at least Kalanick, Jones' decision to depart followed an announcement that Uber has decided to seek a strong chief operating officer to assist Kalanick in running the compnay. In a note to Uber staff on Sunday, Kalanick said that Jones ""came to the tough decision that he doesn't see his future at Uber"" after the announcement, according to a Recode report .

But if you ask Jones, it was a little more complicated. In a statement provided to Recode, Jones said, ""It is now clear, however, that the beliefs and approach to leadership that have guided my career are inconsistent with what I saw and experienced at Uber, and I can no longer continue as president of the ride-sharing business.""

Why Jones might have decided to get out now

For starters, Uber's decision to seek a COO was spurred by an embarrassing video that showed Kalanick arguing with an Uber driver over fare reductions that the driver claimed had hurt his income. It also followed a former Uber employee's serious, credible allegation of a pattern of sexual harassment at the company.

Uber has hired two outside law firms to conduct investigations related to the former employee's claims. One will investigate her claims specifically, the other is conducting a broader investigation into Uber's workplace practices.

In what may be related developments, two other executives have departed recently:

Uber's senior vice president of engineering, Amit Singhal, resigned after a reporter from Recode informed the company that Singhal had left a prior job at Google following a ""credible"" allegation of sexual harassment.

Uber's vice president of product and growth, Ed Baker, also resigned following allegations that he had been seen kissing an Uber employee at a company event.

There's more. The New York Times reported earlier this month that Uber has been using a software tool called ""Greyball"" to deceive authorities in markets where its service had been pressured by law enforcement or banned.

And in perhaps the most dangerous development for the future of Uber's business, Alphabet 's Waymo self-driving subsidiary has sued Uber, claiming that the head of Uber's self-driving research program, Anthony Levandowski, took proprietary technology secrets with him when he left Google in early 2016 to found self-driving truck start-up Otto, which Uber acquired last summer . Waymo is seeking to halt Uber's self-driving operations. (Uber has called Waymo's allegations ""baseless,"" but hasn't yet responded in detail.)

Long story short: Uber's growth story could be in serious trouble.

The latest sign that Uber could be in serious trouble

Taken together, the recent reports paint a picture of a company where sexual harassment is tolerated, laws are seen as inconveniences to be circumvented, and a showcase technology effort might be based on stolen secrets.

That's all bad for obvious reasons, and for one reason that might be a little less obvious: Like all tech companies, Uber is in a constant battle to hire and retain top talent. These kinds of stories hurt.

Jones, who had come to Uber from Target just six months ago, apparently decided that he had seen enough. But his departure raises a big question: What will Uber's valuation look like the next time it has to raise money -- or when it attempts to go public?

Still, a few stocks left investors reeling today, including Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) DryShips (NASDAQ: DRYS) , and Sonic Corporation (NASDAQ: SONC) . Let's take a closer look at what drove these declines.

Is Google losing its advertising mojo?

Shares of Google parent Alphabet fell a modest half percent after Pivotal Research group analyst Brian Wieser downgraded his rating on shares to hold from buy, expressing concern that advertisers are pulling marketing investments from the internet search titan's platforms over concerns regarding the placement of their ads. To blame, Pivotal says, was a Times of London report (may require subscription) last month indicating video ads from several well-known brands were seen displayed on neo-Nazi and jihadist websites.

Image source: Alphabet.

In particular, Pivotal notes global advertising company Havas opted to stop spending on YouTube and Google display ads last week, while separate reports indicate several industry giants like McDonald's , HSBC , and Audi are all considering similar moves to pull away from Google advertising.

""While Google has apologized for the incidents,"" Wieser added, ""and while the scale of the underlying problem may be relatively small in absolute terms, for larger marketers any one instance of an inappropriate brand placement may be enough to seriously harm a brand's business value.""

DryShips' big offering

Next, shares of dry bulk shipping company DryShips dropped more than 17% after the company filed for a massive $2 billion mixed shelf offering . The move gives DryShips the flexibility to sell a variety of its securities to raise money including common shares, preferred shares debt securities, warrants, purchase contracts, rights, and units, and provides no specific time table or limit to the number of offerings it can employ to do so.

Dryships has already gone through a staggering transformation over the past year, from selling ships to pay debt, raising capital and opening revolving credit facilities to solidify its balance sheet, and announcing its strategic expansion in the gas carrier market just over two months ago. But this mixed shelf offering means more dilution for shareholders is likely coming, even after the company's questionable decision to initiate a fixed $2.5 million quarterly dividend a few weeks ago.

Sonic gives one analyst indigestion

Finally, shares of drive-in restaurant chain Sonic fell 3% after receiving a downgrade to hold from buy at Canaccord Genuity. Canaccord also reduced its per-share price target on Sonic to $24 from $30 -- shares currently trade just above $23 -- citing a trend of softer sales lately and longer-term concerns over increasing competition from ""non-traditional venues"" like convenience stores.

What's more, the analyst firm believes Sonic's recent discounting will continue, and that its lack of new menu innovation will do it no favors in today's difficult dining industry environment. As it stands, investors should receive more clarity on Sonic's business when the company releases fiscal second-quarter 2017 results next week. But in the meantime, this downgrade has pushed Sonic stock to near a fresh 52-week low.

(RTTNews.com) - SoftBank Group Corp. scrapped a planned $100 million investment in a smartphone startup founded by the creator of Google's Android software, partly because of the Japanese investor's increasingly close relationship with Apple Inc., the Wall Street Journal reported citing people familiar with the matter.

The planned investment would have valued the startup, Essential Products Inc., at $1 billion. It had already been agreed to informally, and final investment contracts were being drawn up, the report said.

The offer banked on the pedigree of Essential founder Andy Rubin, who sold his previous startup, Android, to Googleâ€""now a unit of Alphabet Inc.â€""in 2005, then helped turn its software into the world's most used smartphone operating system, powering devices rivaling Apple's iPhone.

In January, Apple agreed to commit $1 billion to the Vision Fund. Though Apple didn't block the Essential deal, according to the journal, its investment complicated SoftBank's interest in a competing smartphone company. In February, after months of negotiations and when final investment contracts were being drawn up, Mr. Son backed out of the deal.

Since Amazon ( AMZN ) has a negligible presence in the software-as-a-service segment, most of that revenue is coming from the infrastructure-as-a-service segment, which continues to grow at double-digit rates.

Microsoft 's ( MSFT ) cloud segment has been keeping pace with Amazon on the revenue front, and the company reported a commercial cloud annualized run rate of $14 billion during the most recent quarter. But the difference here is the bulk of Microsoft's cloud revenue is coming from its SaaS portfolio. Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment, which houses Azure along with server products and enterprise services, had only $6.9 billion in revenues during the most recent quarter.

But Microsoft's advantage is that its SaaS lineup, led by Office 365, has been growing at a phenomenal rate, while Azure revenue has been growing near triple-digit rates for the past several quarters. For Microsoft's SaaS customers, Azure remains one click away. In addition, consumers tend to prefer a single vendor when possible because it reduces a lot of integration and development headaches. Microsoft does stand out from other cloud providers for this reason: nobody else has such a strong SaaS and IaaS offering.

Microsoft has already positioned itself as the one-stop solution for organizations. You can use Azure to take care of your infrastructure, Office 365 for office collaboration and Dynamics 365 for business management. The further the SaaS lead Microsoft registers, the wider the moat for competition.

Amazon and Alphabet ( GOOG )( GOOGL ) have realized this problem and are quickly moving to address the gap. Google announced several new features and services to G Suite, its office productivity application, while Amazon has Workdocs, Amazon Workmail and Amazon Chime under its belt for office productivity. Amazon Chime, a competitor to Skype, was launched earlier this year, and the company updated Workdocs just yesterday.

Amazon is extremely late to the office collaboration game, while Google let the market slip between its fingers. Microsoft already has 85 million monthly active Office 365 users and is growing fast. Switching from one productivity software vendor to another is easier said than done because there are huge barriers like cost, migration and training involved.

Even if Amazon and Google try to undercut Microsoft by keeping their pricing lower than those of Office 365 subscriptions, it will not be enough to poach users because their products have not yet evolved to be comparable to it. What's more, Microsoft keeps expanding Office 365 services at a furious pace, while keeping a tight rein its own pricing.

By the time Amazon and Google get their respective products up to par with Microsoft's, the giant will have already captured a huge chunk of market share. Amazon's lead in IaaS and Microsoft's lead in SaaS cannot be erased that easily, and both these companies are going to rule these segments for at least the next few years. Considering the operating margins in these two segments, they are going to be very profitable businesses.

In reality, the meeting was neither overly dovish or hawkish. The Fed stuck to its playbook of hiking rates and muting expectations going forward. Their infamous dots still project two more planned hikes this year and three more the year following.

Nautilus Research published the following chart noting market action following the third rate hike in a tightening cycle.

The ""three steps and a stumble"" theory was put forth by late trader and market guru Marty Zweig (he wrote a book worth reading, titled ""Winning on Wall Street"" ). Zweig noticed the market has a tendency to considerably underperform following the third rate hike in a hiking cycle. Here's the following from Nautilus.

""The SP500 has endured significantly below average results from 1 to 12 months after 3rd rate hikes in 11 events back to 1955. Note that 6 (more than half) of those hikes occurred within a year of a major cyclical top for stocks (1955, 1965, 1968, 1973, 1980, 1999). However, the market defied that relationship on the last occurrence in 2004 by rallying for 3 more years... When looking at all hikes - note that hikes are generally bad for stocks, somewhat bad for the US Dollar, and bullish for 10yr yields and commodities.""

Yale economics professor Robert Shiller, of CAPE ratio and ""Irrational Exuberance"" fame, noted the similarities in sentiment between the current market and that of the late tech bubble in a recent Bloomberg article (an analog we've discussed quite a bit ).

""They're both revolutionary eras, in the tech boom it was a new era of prosperity brought on by the internet. Now it's a 'Great Leader' has appeared,"" Shiller said. ""The idea is, everything is different.""

But no matter how you cut it, Shiller said, ""The market is way overpriced. It is not as intellectual as people would think, or as economists would have you believe.""

Going off of the chart below, it is safe to say we are transitioning from the greed to euphoria stage. Take a look at magazine covers and article headlines and it is easy to see the market is entering a new level of optimism and complacency.

As we progress further into the latter innings of this cycle, and as expectations become more and more dependent on a narrowly defined and exceedinglyoptimistic future , it pays to remember the following from Mark Buchanan's book, ""Ubiquity: Why Catastrophes Happen"" (bolding is mine):

""In this simplified setting of the sandpile, the power law also points to something else: the surprising conclusion that even the greatest of events have no special or exceptional causes. After all, every avalanche large or small starts out the same way, when a single grain falls and makes the pile just slightly too steep at one point. What makes one avalanche much larger than another has nothing to do with its original cause, and nothing to do with some special situation in the pile just before it starts. Rather, it has to do with the perpetually unstable organization of the critical state, which makes it always possible for the next grain to trigger an avalanche of any size.""

Note, there will be 11 Fed members speaking this week. Who knows what kind of tone they will take, but it should make for an interesting week.

Shares of Mountain View, California-based Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are likely to head much higher by the end of the year, backed by strong fundamentals. However, in the near term, GOOGL stock may be headed for a correction. Shares of Alphabet Inc have run up quite in a bit in the last month, and the stock is up by more than 7% since the 1st of February. Based on a combination of technical indicators, the stock looks set for a near term correction. Investors who want to own the stock could use any potential corrections as buying opportunities to enter the stock, given the strong long term outlook.

GOOGL stock looks set for a near term correction - technical analysis.

Shares of Alphabet have had momentum strongly in their favor over the last few months. GOOGL stock has risen sharply from just over $750 a share in November last year, to over $872 a share, where it is trading currently. And if you go by the company's fundamentals, the rally may not be over yet. However, following a solid one month during which the stock gained by over 7%, GOOGL shares have entered overbought territory based on a combination of two popular technical indicators. The two indicators we're talking about are the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Bollinger Bands. For starters, let's look at the Relative Strength Index.

The RSI is a popular indicator that's used to highlight overbought and oversold situations. For those unfamiliar, the RSI basically compares the magnitude of recent gains with recent losses, over a specified time period, to measure speed and change of price movements of the underlying security. The standard time frame that's used is 14 days. However, traders can potentially use a different time frame that they like. In essence, the RSI basically quantifies recent momentum. When the RSI is above 70, it indicates an overbought condition, while a reading below 30 is indicative of an oversold condition. Again, traders do use their own thresholds to identify overbought and oversold states, but these are the most commonly used thresholds. If you look at a technical chart for GOOGL stock, the RSI entered overbought territory, rising to 71.9 on Thursday, and subsequently to 72.8 on Friday.

The other popular indicator that's signalling an overbought condition is the Bollinger Band. Bollinger Bands are plotted two standard deviations away from a simple moving average, both above and below it. The most commonly used is the 21 day Simple Moving Average (SMA). While the two standard deviations capture ~90% of the price movements, if the stock price touches the band above, the upper band, it's deemed to be overbought. If the stock price touches the lower band, it is deemed to be oversold. For now, GOOGL shares have hit the upper band, indicating that the stock is currently in overbought territory, and could correct in the near term.

Summing It Up - Buy GOOGL Stock On Dips.

Despite the possibility of a correction in the near term, GOOGL stock still looks attractive for long term investors. Even with its massive revenue base, Alphabet Inc is still managing to deliver solid growth. And if reports are to be believed, Google is also catching up with Amazon in the cloud computing market. To be clear, Google still has a long way to go before it can worry Amazon, but The Motley Fool's Evan Niu suggests that it is indeed catching up, albeit slowly. We'd discussed this in more detail ourselves in a recent article that looked at whether GOOGL stock was really worth $1000, as many analysts have suggested it does. As things stand, GOOGL stock is a good bet for 2017. We believe that shares of Alphabet Inc are headed higher, and we like the stock fundamentally, to the extent that we've added it to our list of top stock picks, which have beaten the NASDAQ by over 134%.

A reporting change announced with the Q4 results appeared to have spooked the market.

The stock quickly sold off following solid numbers and trading relatively cheap. Though Alphabet has rallied back to all-time highs suggesting investors have officially spoken on the issue of GAAP versus non-GAAP numbers for good reason.

Q1 Shift

On the Q4 earnings call, CFO Ruth Porat made the following disclosure that surely surprised the market:

My suggestion is that the $40 dip in the stock was over some initial panic that Alphabet was no longer going to retain value if the EPS dips. After all, the stock-based compensation is a large amount of the quarterly EPS totals.

For Q4, Alphabet had $1.8 billion in SBC charges, up from $1.4 billion last year. For all of 2016, the SBC charges were an incredible $6.7 billion. Remember though that the share count grew by 3.2 million shares over last Q4 and accounts for the SBC within the EPS calculation.

Source: Alphabet Q416 earnings release

After a week or so, the market shook off this irrational sell off. In reality, the value of the stock is not altered at all whether Alphabet changes the reporting. The key cash flows won't change and including the SBC charges in the diluted EPS number is duplicative.

The real impact to the company is higher share counts. The accounting rationale for the charge is to derive the effectiveness of management and to factor in the cost of the issuance of shares for compensation.

The number though is included in the EPS that includes the share count. Investors looking at cash flows won't include the SBC charge any way and this explains the stock rebounded to close at an all-time high over $872.

GAAP Vs. Non-GAAP

Regardless of what the company does with reporting, investors can value the stock either way. The interesting part is how the stock is reported by different financial sites that report the EPS numbers.

Yahoo Finance is clearly shifting towards using the GAAP numbers. The 2017 EPS estimates have dipped over the last 60 days to only $33.41 from $41.11.

Source: Yahoo Finance

Conversely, YCharts is still using the non-GAAP numbers for EPS estimates. The charts show a 2017 EPS estimate of $41.63 and $48.66 for 2018.

GOOGL EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts

Using the traditional non-GAAP numbers, Alphabet is only trading at a forward P/E multiple of 17.9. To reach the magical $1,000 mark, the stock would only trade at a P/E multiple of 20.6.

Takeaway

The key investor takeaway is that Alphabet appears ready to break out towards $1,000. The stock could face a jolt when reporting Q1 results towards the end of April that doesn't include non-GAAP EPS numbers excluding SBC.

Either way, investors would be wise to ignore the noise surrounding the official reporting of these numbers and load up on any irrational dips.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To help with that, Google created a new open-source JPEG encoder that will purportedly reduce the file sizes of images while maintaining picture quality, allowing websites to load faster.

The new encoder is called Guetzli — Swiss German for “cookie,” apparently — and according to Google, it can create “high quality JPEG images with file sizes 35 percent smaller than currently available methods.” The advantage to using Guetzli instead of a new format is that the images are still regular JPEG files, and so they’re still compatible with almost every browser and application that exists.

Google has several other projects to reduce image sizes on the web, including its Zopfli encoder (which similarly creates smaller PNG files without breaking format compatibility) and WebP (a new image format that supports both lossless and lossy compression for improved file sizes).

According to Google, Guetzli does take “significantly longer” to compress images than other methods of JPEG encoding, but it feels that the slower speed in creating the image is worth the speed gains when loading it. Additionally, the company cites a Google Research paper that claims that users found the Guetzli images to be of higher quality than similar and even larger JPEG files created with other methods.

For more details on the nitty-gritty of how Guetzli actually accomplishes the improved encoding (it apparently involves “psychovisual models”) check out the Google Research Blog and the published paper on Guetzli.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A major global marketing company became the first to pull all its advertising spending with Google after the news that adverts for a range of organisations had been inadvertently placed next to extremist material. MPs meanwhile threatened that legislation could be put on the table if social media companies did not effectively self-regulate.

The company has been forced to review its advertising policies after the UK government joined organisations including the Guardian, BBC and Transport for London in pulling advertising from Google and YouTube in response to the news. The company has also been summoned to the Cabinet Office.

An influential group of MPs from the home affairs select committee wrote to the company on Friday, accusing them of “profiting from hatred” just days after accusing Google, Twitter and Facebook of “commercial prostitution” because of a failure to tackle hate speech on their platforms.

Labour MP Yvette Cooper, chair of the HASC, said that despite reassurances during the committee hearing that the companies did not allow hate speech or terrorist content to be monetised, media reports had revealed “that this is not the case”.

“Government advertisements and major brands advertising is still being placed on inappropriate and hate-filled sites,” she wrote. “As a result Google and these organisations are still profiting from hatred.”

Cooper called on Google to refund money to the government and other advertisers and explain “how this has happened, and what you are doing to prevent it ever happening again.”

Google could face an embarrassing number of refund requests, which it is understood will be issued in the form of credits to advertisers if the company made an error placing an ad and concluded that the material was sufficiently offensive to terminate the account of the publisher.

Conservative MP Tim Loughton, who also sits on the committee, said if social media companies “would not do their own self-regulation, they will have to face proper regulation” – raising the prospect of more restrictive UK legislation being brought against internet giants. He supported a move in Germany which could see social media companies face fines of up to €50m (£44m) if they failed to delete offending material within a week. .

“There is a real public appetite that would support those companies being brought to heel,” he said.

Labour MP Chuka Umunna said: “It is wrong that these social media companies should make billions of dollars out of running their platforms but don’t make the necessary investments to properly police them.”

Meanwhile Google was facing growing commercial pressure, with French advertising group Havas, whose clients include O2, EDF and Royal Mail, becoming the first of the major global marketing companies to pull all its advertising spending from its platforms.

Havas, the world’s sixth largest marketing services group, spends about £175m on digital advertising on behalf of clients in the UK annually.

The firm said it had taken the step after talks with Google had broken down because the tech company had been “unable to provide specific reassurances, policy and guarantees that their video or display content is classified either quickly enough or with the correct filters.”

Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of the world’s largest marketing services group WPP, was critical of Google, but fell short of blacklisting the company from its UK advertising schedule.

“Google, Facebook and others are media companies and have the same responsibilities as any other media company,” said Sorrell. “They cannot masquerade as technology companies, particularly when they place advertisements.”

Publicis, the world’s third largest marketing group, said that it is reviewing its global relationship with Google and YouTube. The company, which has clients including Samsung, Coty and Mars, was highly critical of Google’s failures.

“Publicis Media is committed to being at the forefront of rigorous brand safety, viewability and verification standards and protocols,” said a spokeswoman. “We hold all publishers, including Google and YouTube, accountable to ensure that the highest standards of advertising are consistently met.”

It is also understood that Tesco has joined the host of advertisers to “pause” spending on YouTube for the time being.

In face of the growing pressure Google promised it would conduct a “thorough review of our ads policies and brand controls”. Ronan Harris, managing director of Google UK, said the company would be making changes in the coming weeks to give brands more control over where their adverts appeared.



Harris said 400 hours of video was uploaded to YouTube every minute, adding that last year Google removed nearly 2 billion “bad ads” from its systems, removed over 100,000 publishers from its AdSense programme and prevented adverts from serving on over 300m YouTube videos.

“We’ve heard from our advertisers and agencies loud and clear that we can provide simpler, more robust ways to stop their ads from showing against controversial content,” he said.

The controversy comes after a Times investigation revealed that adverts from government departments, Channel 4, the BBC, Argos, L’Oréal and others were placed next to YouTube videos of American white nationalists, a hate preacher banned in the UK and a controversial Islamist preacher.

Ads for the Guardian’s membership scheme are understood to have been placed alongside a range of extremist material after an agency acting on the media group’s behalf used Google’s AdX ad exchange, which uses programmatic trading. The Guardian withdrew its advertising from Google and YouTube in response.

The use of programmatic trading, which automates the process of buying and selling advertising online, is increasingly controversial, raising concerns that it both hurts media revenues and supports extremist material.

A government spokeswoman said it had placed a temporary restriction on YouTube advertising pending assurance. Google has been summoned to the Cabinet Office “to explain how it will deliver the high quality of service government demands on behalf of the taxpayer.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The company had the audacity to say: ""This isn't an ad; the beauty in the Assistant is that it invites our partners to be our guest and share their tales."" To me, this means that any partner that wants to work with Google can show up in my living room. Being hassled by advertisers while using Home isn't a ""feature"" that Google has ever talked about before.

The backlash was swift; Google responded quickly. Within a few hours, Google had removed the ad from Home and issues a mild apology. Even then, though, it refused to call the message an ad. And lots of Home users are likely going to be suspicious that their device will start shilling products at any time, without warning.

The problem comes down to breaking user expectations. Google advertised a set of features and services for Home in exchange for your $130; integrated ads was not among them. It's different with a product like Amazon's Kindle readers, which display ads on the screen when the device is locked. Though Amazon uses the tricky phase ""with special offers"" to describe Kindles with ads, the product description is clear enough. And you can always pay a little more to get rid of those ads entirely.

Google Home is different. The company has an email address for every single Home user -- if it wanted, it could have contacted them about a new ""partner messages"" program coming to the device. Even if you couldn't opt out, getting a heads up is the bare minimum I'd expect; that email wouldn't keep me from getting ticked off about the change, but at least I'd be aware of what was happening.

To some extent, I believe Google wants to find ways to extend the ""my day"" feature by including some timely info. Home has already given some info about the Oscars ahead of the show, and it also had a special Black History Month story in February. But those experiences are a lot different from a message that simply sounded like an ad, as much as Google claims that wasn't the intent.

Even if we accept Google's line that it's just trying to find ways to enhance the ""my day"" feature, it should be a strictly opt-in feature. The Google Home app lets you customize exactly what you'll hear when you ask the device to tell you about your day. The lack of a checkbox or any other information for these ""partner messages"" makes Google's explanation ring hollow.

Google's apology and quick action around the Beauty and the Beast ad at least kept me from giving up on Home entirely. But given how Google makes money, we should be prepared for something like this to happen again. Hopefully, Google has learned its lesson and won't invade Home users' ... homes without express permission. Personally, the only ads I'll tolerate on Google Home are from ad-supported services I might use with it -- not from the Google Assistant itself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Webster posted the warrant on his site, explaining that Edina Police Department sought the records after a bank, Spire Credit Union, was contacted by a man they thought was a customer asking for a $28,500 wire transfer. Turned out it was a fraud attempt and whoever was behind it had created a fake passport to use as ID.

Police did a Google image search for the real bank account owner and discovered the fake passport photo used by the fraudster, which was not of the real victim but of someone with the same name. Searches on Bing and Yahoo didn't return the same photo.

Believing the perpetrator lived in Edina, the cops asked a court if they could request Google provide records of everyone in the city who'd searched four different variations of the victim's name between December 1 2016 and January 7 2017. Specifically, they wanted names, email addresses, social security numbers, payment information, account data and IP addresses, which could be enough to identify where those searches were made.

Needless to say a lot of innocent people could be caught up in such a data grab. ""It's possible that such a wide net could catch completely routine and non-criminal searches of the victim's name by neighbors, prospective employers or business associates, journalists, or friends,"" said Webster.

Unsurprisingly, there was a fair amount of disbelief from privacy and legal experts, including this from Elizabeth Joh, professor at UC Davis School of Law:

Is this for real?

Holy shit. Case name should be In re Minnesota Unconstitutional General Warrant. Nice job unearthing @webster https://t.co/lGUd6s32dt — Andrew Crocker (@agcrocker) March 16, 2017

Google initially rejected a subpoena from Hennepin County, but investigators are still arguing for the information. It's unknown if Google is fighting the new order. A Google spokesperson said: ""We aren't able to comment on specific cases, but we will always push back when we receive excessively broad requests for data about our users.""

A spokesperson from Edina Police Department said they could not comment on active investigations.

UPDATE Edina-based lawyer Timothy Webb emailed after publication, saying he believes the warrant applies to anyone who made the Google search, not just those located within Edina, even if the document indicated it was limited to the city. ""There is ... nothing in the application to suggest that the suspect searched from within the city of Edina,"" said Webb.

There's a new Gmail phishing scam that is crafty enough to fool even well-versed internet users.

Source: YouTube

The new Gmail phishing scam includes an image that looks almost exactly like the Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , GOOGL ) company's own attachment image. However, this is only a trick to gain a user's login credentials.

When a person that is the target of the Gmail phishing scam clicks on the image in the email, it will take them to a page that looks almost identical to Google's own login page. Once the person enters their email and password into the fake website, their account can be taken over .

This Gmail phishing scam has been around for a few months now, but has started gaining additional attention following coverage from Lifehacker . Those with acute eyes may be able to notice the hack due to the URL being incorrect for Google's login screen.

If users don't notice the URL change when being taken to the fake Google login screen, then they may get caught by this Gmail phishing scam. Users of Chrome that keep it regularly updated will see a warning when visiting a site like this, but other web browsers may not warn the user of the scam.

The Gmail phishing scam was originally discovered by Wordfence back in January. It suggests that users with fears that their accounts may have been hit in the hack should check their login history to see where their accounts have been accessed from. The website also advises changing passwords every few months, just to be safe.

UPDATE 1-French ad group Havas says only UK unit pulling adverts from Google



(Adds Havas statement) PARIS, March 17 (Reuters) - French advertising group Havas said on Friday that it would not pull advertising from Alphabet Inc's <GOOG.O> Google platforms on a global basis, after its British business suspended activity with the U.S. company over concerns about its YouTube website. The British government had been expected to question Google executives on Friday on why ads marketing government services were appearing alongside videos carrying hate speech and extremist content on YouTube. [nL5N1GU312] The Guardian newspaper reported that Havas had decided to pull all its advertising from Google and YouTube, citing Havas UK chief Paul Frampton. However, Havas Chief Executive Yannick Bollore tweeted that he had been unaware of its British unit's decision. A spokeswoman later said the rest of the group would not follow suit. ""The decision of our UK team to pause activity with our partner Google is a temporary move made by the local team on behalf of our UK clients and their specific needs,"" she said in an emailed statement. ""We are working with Google to resolve the issues so that we can return to using this valuable platform in the UK."" Google said early on Friday in a statement that it worked hard to prevent ads from appearing on pages or videos with ""hate speech, gory or offensive content"" and that it had launched a review to give brands more control over where their ads appeared. <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ UK to question Google after adverts appear alongside extremist videos [nL5N1GU312] ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> (Reporting by Gwenaelle Barzic and Michel Rose; Editing by David Goodman and Richard Chang) ((michel.rose@thomsonreuters.com; +33149495071; Reuters Messaging: michel.rose.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net; Twitter handle: @michelreuters)) Keywords: BRITAIN GOOGLE/HAVAS (UPDATE 1)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The so-called ""FANG stocks"" have been an incredibly-well performing group. For those who don't know, FANG consists of Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) - formerly Google.

Source: Shutterstock

Why has this group been so successful? Despite a few of them sporting lofty valuations, they are the respective kings of their industries. Facebook dominates social media, Netflix owns streaming, Amazon is the king of e-commerce and Google owns the online search engine.

Over the past five years, Alphabet is the worst performing of the FANG stocks, returning ""just"" 180%. After that, it's Facebook, which has generated 265%. Amazon's 360% return stands out and Netflix's 830% gain jumps off the page. Have these stocks gone too far, though?

I wouldn't necessarily argue that. Some names warrant some extra caution in my view, however. Let's take a further look to see which stocks are worth holding onto and which are worth taking profits in.

FANG Stocks: Facebook (FB)

Source: The Crunchies! via Flickr

We'll keep the FANG stocks in order, so let's begin with Facebook . Facebook has impressively captivated billions of users through its platform. At last check, Facebook catered to 1.23 billion daily active users, an 18% increase year-over-year. Monthly active users of 1.86 billion increased 17% year-over-year.

Even more impressively, Facebook has found a way to grow its revenue growth. That may seem like a typo, but it's not. FB has managed to not only grow sales on a year-over-year basis, but also accelerate that rate of growth as well. After impressively growing sales in the 40% to 49% range through fiscal 2015, FB has now managed 50%+ revenue growth for five consecutive quarters. Obviously the company has found a way to continually grow and its users are not tiring of its various ad formats.

FB stock is not egregiously priced either; with a forward price-earnings ratio of just 21, Facebook shares are not that expensive with earnings per share expected to grow 28.1% this year and 23.4% next year.

Throw in the fact that Facebook has topped earnings expectations over the past 13 quarters and the stock becomes even more attractive. Shares have been on a tear this year. But a pullback to its 50-day moving average near $131 could be a buying opportunity.

FANG Stocks: Amazon (AMZN)

AMZN stock has also done well in 2017, up 14%. We all know about the decaying retail sector and Amazon's ability to capitalize on that weakness. But judging the future of commerce can be difficult, especially with how quickly Amazon continues to move.

The biggest concern for Amazon skeptics has been earnings. Despite years of 20%-plus revenue growth, AMZN's bottom line has hugged the flatline. Management argues that it's investing in itself for even more growth and so far, investors have been patient. They've also been rewarded. Over the past 10 years, shares are up more than 2,000%. Thankfully, Amazon started to pad its bottom line with its Web Services cloud business.

While I personally love Amazon, I would be a bit leery of AMZN stock at these prices. Just last year we found out the hard way how fast things can change with sentiment. In the beginning of 2016, AMZN stock stumbled from $675 to sub-$500 in just five weeks. That 26% haircut startled plenty of investors, despite the stock rebounding to north of $800 a share within a year.

The lesson here is simple: Amazon shares are not invincible during pullbacks. Should we get a notable broader market correction, AMZN stock will not be spared. That is the best time to buy the stock . Now that it's through the holiday season and continues to invest at a heavy pace , shares could struggle in the intermediate term.

A decline to its 200-day moving average would be a great place to initiate a long position. That mark is currently near $780 per share. Any further declines could be used to accumulate the stock.

FANG Stocks: Netflix (NFLX)

Source: Via Netflix

NFLX stock is one a lot of investors are kicking themselves over. Shares languished below $100 through most of 2016. At the time, some feared higher content costs and sloppy overseas execution.

Those fears still exist to some point, but Netflix has shown better execution as of late. As a result, shares have catapulted to north of $140. The stock has been consolidating nicely around this level. With the 50-day moving average just below, it appears Netflix may be setting up for a move to new all-time highs .

Investors who want to buy now could use the 50-day moving average - or a price just below - as their stop-loss. They could also wait for a possible decline to its 200-day moving average, currently just below $115, to buy. Longer-term investors may consider initiating a position in the name, with a plan to purchase more on additional declines.

The problem with NFLX stock is simple: valuation. Not many investors question the shift in video content consumption. The trend is in favor of Netflix, which holds a dominant position in the streaming world. I consider Netflix a very battleground-based stock. On the one hand, it's trailing P/E ratio of 384 is near the top of its five-year range. On the other hand, its forward P/E ratio is the lowest it's been in the same time frame.

The streaming offerings from Alphabet's YouTube, as well as Hulu could also be a concern. For now, the bulls seem to be in control of NFLX stock. Should Netflix's execution deteriorate or competition eat into its growth, the narrative may change. But for now, staying long Netflix seems like it will work.

FANG Stocks: Alphabet (GOOGL)

Source: Shutterstock

Like Facebook, one of the main attractions to Alphabet is actually the valuation. Trading at 21.8 times next year's earnings, shares of Alphabet aren't priced too expensive. Analysts expect GOOGL to churn out earnings growth of 17.5% next year, along with 19.3% annual earnings growth over the next five years.

Alphabet's founders may have paved the way for internet domination. But there's a new team member to its C-suite that has given GOOGL a much-needed boost. CFO Ruth Porat joined the company in May 2015.

In the year leading up to her hire, shares had been stagnant, returning just 5%. Since her addition, though, the stock is up a whopping 60%. Does it also seem like a coincidence that Alphabet missed analysts' estimates on at least six straight quarters prior to her arrival? Since then, Alphabet has topped estimates in five of the past six quarters.

Admittedly, Alphabet's transparency has been better, making it easier for analysts to form estimates. But this added clarity makes it easier on investors and helps lower volatility. For better or for worse, Alphabet takes some gambles. For instance, consider Alphabet's self-driving car unit, Waymo. Porat has not stifled this growth. Rather, she has reigned in expenses and channeled GOOGL's focus. As a result, the bottom line has improved, without future potential being eliminated .

With a consistent core business in Google and potential upsides in businesses like Waymo, GOOGL stock is attractive. With its dependable growth and a reasonable valuation, it's even better. At just a hair under all-time highs, though, now may not be the best time to buy. A retest of its 50-day moving average near $840 and a further decline to its 200-day moving average near $800 would offer better entry opportunities.

As of this writing, Bret Kenwell did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

3/17/2017,0.585517316,0.272073902,851.61,853.4,847.11,852.12,1716471,6.29,0.51,1,"Driverless car technology is still in its nascent stage but will grow in leaps and bounds in the coming years. IHS Automotive forecasts that autonomous vehicle sales will shoot up from 600,000 units in 2025 to almost 21 million by 2035, clocking a compound annual growth rate of 43%.

The Boston Consulting Group, meanwhile, expects the driverless car market to create a $42 billion revenue opportunity in 2025 itself, indicating that there is a lot of money to be made in this space. One of the ways to tap this huge opportunity is through technology providers such as Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) , as they will play mission-critical roles in enabling autonomous cars.

NVIDIA's GPUs are boosting self-driving technology

NVIDIA is best known for making gaming graphics cards, but its products are in high demand from automakers as well. Tesla , for instance, is using the chipmaker's artificial intelligence-based DRIVE PX2 platform in the Model S and Model X cars. What's more, the automaker is also going to deploy NVIDIA's supercomputer in its mass-market Model 3.

The Tesla partnership is already delivering results, as NVIDIA's automotive revenue shot up over 37% year over year for the fiscal fourth quarter. The company could sustain its automotive momentum, as it is working with German giant Audi to bring a Level 4 autonomous car to the market by 2020. Level 4 means it can drive itself entirely on its own.

The two companies showcased an Audi Q7 at CES earlier this year, claiming that the car learned to drive on its own in just four days using NVIDIA's AI-based DRIVE PX2 supercomputer. More importantly, NVIDIA is looking to push the envelope: It's now working on a more advanced supercomputing platform -- Xavier -- that consumes less power but packs more computing capacity.

NVIDIA's graphics processing units accelerate the processing of huge amounts of data in real time, allowing the vehicle to make quick decisions. As the company increasingly turns its attention toward making its self-driving supercomputers better through partnerships with big auto companies, it won't be surprising if its platform ends up powering fully autonomous cars by 2020.

NVIDIA, therefore, looks right on the edge of tapping the driverless car opportunity, as 80 companies are using the DRIVE PX2 platform to develop their technology.

Microsoft's big data opportunity

Driverless cars, or any connected car for that matter, will generate huge volumes of data from their sensors and cameras that will need storage and processing. Microsoft wants to ingest all this data and then use its artificial intelligence (AI) skills to analyze it to help cars drive better through its Azure cloud-based Connected Vehicle Platform.

Image source: Microsoft.

The Redmond-based company has picked a sweet spot to tap the driverless car opportunity, as a connected vehicle is slated to produce 20 gigabytes of data per day in 2017 if driven for just two hours. In the case of autonomous cars, the data generation could be at least 10 gigabytes per second. Now, all this data can't be stored on the car itself due to limited storage capacity, creating an opportunity for Microsoft to push its cloud product to automakers.

The Renault-Nissan alliance has already decided to use the software giant's connected vehicle platform, pledging to put 10 cars with autonomous technology on the road by 2020. Additionally, Indian automaker Tata Motors is adopting the platform to bring connectivity features and predictive maintenance at affordable prices to mass-market vehicles in India.

Microsoft is also finding demand for its connected car platform beyond automakers. For instance, reinsurance provider Swiss Re will analyze driving behavior with the help of the telematics data collected by the cloud, and then create customized insurance deals for customers.

The inevitable data increase from driverless and connected cars could power Microsoft's Azure cloud business to new highs in the long run, allowing it to sustain rapid revenue growth from this segment.

Image source: Waymo.

Alphabet's Waymo moonshot could be a big business

Alphabet's Waymo division has the best driverless car technology, according to data from the California DMV. As it turns out, its driverless cars have the lowest incidence rates and the highest miles logged compared to the others testing their technology on California roads.

Alphabet can use its lead in this space by becoming an infrastructure and knowledge supplier to auto companies, and this is what it is probably planning to do. Earlier this year, Waymo announced that it is going to manufacture driverless-technology-enabling sensors on its own so that it can better integrate the software into hardware.

In fact, the Waymo division has slashed the price of the crucial LIDAR sensor by 90% since 2009, so it makes sense for it to offer a packaged hardware-software bundle to potential customers. The company has already gained a customer in the form of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles for its self-driving technology, with Bloomberg reporting that both companies could eventually roll out a ride-sharing service.

On the other hand, Honda seems to be warming up to Waymo's self-driving capabilities to accelerate its own driverless car development. The Japanese automaker is now exploring the possibility of equipping its cars with fully autonomous driving technology in cities instead of its earlier ambition of just highway driving.

Therefore, Alphabet's years of leadership in driverless cars make it one of the hottest prospects to benefit from this emerging technology.

The most recent third-party estimate from Canalys pegs AWS global market share at nearly 34% in the fourth quarter, larger than the next three largest competitors -- Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , and IBM -- combined (31%).

Competition is heating up, and rivals are starting to chip away at AWS' dominance.

AWS is hugely important to the Amazon thesis

That's the underlying theme of a research note from Pacific Crest (via Tech Trader Daily ). Analyst Brent Bracelin is reiterating an overweight rating but slightly reducing his price target from $905 to $895, while expressing some concern that Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are starting to catch up and ""becom[e] more viable."" The software and search giants both continue to invest heavily in their cloud offerings, both in terms of technical capability as well as geographic expansion and reach.

Since AWS is immensely more profitable that Amazon's core e-commerce business, its results carry a disproportionate weight when it comes to the bottom line, and strong AWS performance has been a key driver of Amazon's rally over the past two years, which has seen shares more than double.

AMZN data by YCharts .

Microsoft Azure is making inroads at large enterprise customers and government agencies, which are increasingly transitioning their needs away from their own data center infrastructures and toward public cloud platforms. Google Cloud has scored a high-profile win in Snap , which has committed to spending $2 billion with the search giant and is only using AWS as a backup . Google also recently announced a handful of other big wins for its cloud business.

Bracelin still believes that AWS has a ""multiyear competitive lead,"" despite rivals starting to catch up in different ways. As a result, he is tempering his expectations for growth for the next two years. Overall, the analyst considers decelerating growth a ""minor concern,"" but it's definitely something that should be on investors' radar.

Rising cloud use lifts all infrastructure vendors

It's worth pointing out that the cloud infrastructure market is growing so fast -- up 49% last year and expected to jump another 46% this year -- that there should be plenty to go around. The cloud infrastructure market could generate a total of $55.8 billion in total revenue this year. Of course, the dominant vendors will compete aggressively, but we're not talking about zero-sum competition.

(RTTNews.com) - The European Commission said Friday that, following discussions with Facebook Inc. ( FB ), Google and Twitter Inc. ( TWTR ), it has given them one month to come up with detailed plans on how they would comply with EU regulations. If final proposals are not satisfactory, consumer authorities could ultimately resort to enforcement action.

The European union consumer authorities and organisations have received a growing number of complaints from consumers, who have been targeted by fraud or scams when using social media websites, as well as having been subject to certain terms of services that do not respect EU consumer law, the EU said.

On this basis, EU consumer authorities, under the leadership of the French consumer authority and with the support of the European Commission, sent a letter to Facebook, Twitter and Google+ last November asking them to address two areas of concern.

Commissioner JourovÃ¡ said,"".... Social media companies also need to take more responsibility in addressing scams and fraud happening on their platforms. I want to thank the EU consumer authorities who have worked tirelessly with the Commission on this important issue over the past months. From today, social media companies have one month to come up with solutions to comply with EU rules.""

The companies have agreed to propose changes on two areas: Unfair terms and conditions; addressing fraud and scams that mislead consumers when using the social networks.

The EU noted that the Social media companies must remove any fraud and scams appearing on their websites that could mislead consumers, once they become aware of such practices. In this connection, national consumer protection authorities should have a direct and standardised communication channel to signal such wrongdoings to social media operators and obtain take down of content, as well as information concerning the traders responsible for the infringements. This is in line with EU consumer legislation and the E-Commerce Directive, which gives the possibility to Member States to establish procedures governing the removal or disabling of access to illegal information.

Brands (NYSE: YUM) , and Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) . Even after rising about 17%, 14%, and 19%, respectively, in the past 12 months, each of these stocks still looks attractive today.

Alphabet

While Alphabet, parent company of Google, is a pure technology stock, investors shouldn't automatically assume it's just another risky tech stock. On the contrary, Alphabet's leadership in search has carved out a wide economic moat for the company.

Alphabet's Google advertising business, which comprises about 86% of Alphabet's total revenue, is driven by the company's powerful search business. Helping Google's advertising revenue increase 17% year over year, Alphabet's search business not only remains dominant, but its lead over competition even seems to be increasing. Research company eMarketer recently forecasted Alphabet's share of U.S. search advertising will increase from 75.8% to 80% in 2018, thanks to the company's timely and aggressive investments in mobile search.

With a price-to-earnings ratio of about 30, Alphabet isn't cheap. But a wide economic moat and persistent strong growth make this stock worth owning.

Yum! Brands

Yum! Brands offers investors a way to buy into a collection of some of the most well-known food franchises on the planet: KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell. With these highly scalable quick-service restaurants under its ownership, Yum! Brands is well positioned to not only grow, but also to pay investors a solid dividend while it's at it; management expects annualized growth in system sales and operating profit of about 7% in constant currency, and the stock currently offers a dividend yield of about 1.9%.

With a price-to-earnings ratio of about 26, Yum! Brands certainly isn't trading at a deep discount. But its sustainable business model and management's expectations for robust system sales make this stock look tasty.

Wells Fargo

As the biggest bank in the U.S. measured by deposits, Wells Fargo is a bet on a bank with significant scale. Add in Wells Fargo's emphasis of enduring customer relationships, operational excellence, and conservative risk management, Wells Fargo is nearly in a class of its own.

While the bank's sales culture created some ethical problems for the company recently, it's worth noting that even famed investor Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway hasn't sold a single share of the bank amid the high-profile headlines -- a notable move considering Wells Fargo is Berkshire's biggest holding, valued at about $30 billion.

While Wells Fargo is up sharply recently, its attractiveness is highlighted by its 2.6% dividend yield and its conservative price-to-book ratio of 1.7 (which is still well below pre-recession levels). Further, the stock still trades at a fairly conservative price-to-earnings ratio of about 15.

In a bull market like this, a pullback in the overall stock market is certainly possible -- and these three stocks could very well suffer along with the market if this happens. But these are the sort of stocks that have a good chance of performing solidly on a five-year time horizon even if they are purchased at today's prices.

Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) are companies that have become known for their large and growing cloud computing businesses. We don't think of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE: BABA ) that way. But according to a new report , the Chinese e-commerce giant could make the biggest cloud-induced leap in the coming years, which could be a major catalyst for Alibaba stock.

Source: Shutterstock

The report by Morgan Stanley said that BABA stock could gain the most market share in the increasingly crowded cloud-computing market in the coming years.

The bank expects Alibaba's cloud revenue from its AliCloud platform to reach $10 billion by 2021, 10 times the $1 billion it sold last year. For perspective, that was 6.3% of the company's total sales last year. In five years, AliCloud is expected to comprise 18% of BABA's total sales.

AliCloud Is a Big Part of Alibaba Stock's Potential

With the company's sales slowing the last few years - from 215% growth in 2012 to 56% growth in 2014 to 29% last year - an extra $9 billion tacked on to its top line over the next five years would be a game changer. It's just a report, and it's based largely on Morgan Stanley's theory that the cloud ""is a transformational technology like electricity,"" and that its usage should broaden in the coming years. If that's the case, then cloud stocks like BABA stock are ""widely undervalued today,"" the report said.

So, add that to the long list of catalysts for a stock that's already up 38% in the last year, including a 20% run-up since late December. Alibaba stock took a hit in 2015 when the Chinese stock market went belly up, falling as low as $57 in September of that year. In the 18 months since, it has nearly doubled.

Meanwhile, sales and earnings are projected to perk up again this year: Analysts anticipate 54% top-line growth, which would be the highest in three years, and 43% earnings-per-share growth. And those numbers don't include much help from AliCloud, which is actually expected to decrease (to 4%) as a percentage of sales this year before really taking flight starting in 2018.

Given its dominance in China's e-commerce market - it's essentially the Chinese Amazon, right down to a recent acquisition of a major online video-streaming entity - Alibaba stock was already a strong long-term investment candidate for any portfolio. Now that BABA, like Amazon before it, is transforming into something much more than an online marketplace, it could be just scratching the surface of its immense potential. The AliCloud will be a huge part of that transformation.

BABA Is AMZN … 15 Years Ago

Fifteen years ago, AMZN was merely a place where people could go online and buy books, CDs and electronics. Then it launched Amazon Web Services in 2002, and the stock took off, tripling within a year. In 2010, the company starting producing original content for online streaming; AMZN stock has risen nearly 8-fold since.

Put simply: Alibaba is where Amazon was 15 years ago. Thus, I think BABA stock is in the very early innings of a sustained, multi-decade rally. Buy it now and thank me in 15 years.

More From InvestorPlace

The post The Jump in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Is Just Beginning appeared first on InvestorPlace .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3/17/2017,0.465158476,0.119341397,851.61,853.4,847.11,852.12,1716471,6.29,0.51,1,"Snap (NYSE: SNAP) , the parent company of Snapchat, made its public debut on March 3, and the results were underwhelming. Snap made its public debut at $17, surged to nearly $30 on the first day, then tumbled back to just over $20 in less than two weeks.

Why did investors seemingly snub Snap, which some bulls have hailed as the ""next Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) ""? The answer is simple -- six red flags indicate that the stock could slide much lower before it's considered a bargain.

Snap's Android app. Image source: Google Play.

1. Slowing user growth

The decline of Twitter 's (NYSE: TWTR ) stock taught us that social networks live and die by their active user growth. Without active user growth, advertisers start skipping the platform in favor of faster growing ones. Snapchat's daily active users (DAUs) rose just 3% sequentially to 158 million last quarter, compared to 7% growth in the third quarter and 17% growth in the second quarter.

That slowdown was likely caused by the launch of new Snapchat-like features for Facebook's Instagram and Messenger apps -- which include Instagram Stories, vanishing Instagram photos, Instant Video for Messenger, and a Messenger Day app which deletes photos and videos after 24 hours. Instagram Stories, in particular, grew its DAUs from 100 million to 150 million between last October and this January.

2. Its cash burn rate

Snap's S-1 filing revealed that it finished fiscal 2016 with just $150.1 million in cash and equivalents -- a 77% decline from $640.8 million at the end of 2015. The company had a negative operating cash flow of $188 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, and it burned through $1.14 in cash for each dollar in generated revenue.

Snap will retain $2.3 billion of the $3.2 billion it raised during its IPO. That amount will help Snap tread water for a while, but it might not last long if its cash burn rate accelerates. Susquehanna analysts believe that Snap won't achieve positive free cash flow until fiscal 2020. However, that estimate could be far too optimistic if rivals like Instagram Stories continue throttling Snapchat's growth.

3. Widening losses

Snap's revenue surged 590% to $404.5 million in 2016. But on the bottom line, its net loss widened from $372.9 million to $514.6 million. The company's biggest expenses include multi-billion dollar cloud contracts with Alphabet 's Google and Amazon .

If Snap can't narrow its losses with such massive revenue growth, things could get very ugly once its top line growth slows down. Snap has also warned in its SEC filing that it ""may never achieve or maintain profitability.""

4. Unrealistic revenue growth targets

Snap claims that it can generate $500 million to $1 billion in revenues in 2017. That's a very wide range, but analysts are modeling their forecasts on the high-end, with an average estimate of $1.04 billion. However, it's unclear how Snap plans to hit that target.

The three types of Snap ads. Image source: Snap.

96% of Snap's revenue came from advertising in 2016. Snap's ad products include full-screen video ads, sponsored geofilters, and sponsored lenses. If Snap's user growth peaks, it could possibly boost its number of marketing partners to generate higher ad revenues per customer. But more than doubling its 2016 revenues to $1 billion in 2017 seems like a huge stretch.

Research firm eMarketer recently trimmed its 2017 ad revenue forecast for Snapchat from $800 million to $770 million. That reduction was modest, but it indicates that analysts aren't certain that it can hit its ambitious growth targets.

5. It thinks it's a ""camera company""

Co-founder and CEO Evan Spiegel has repeatedly declared that Snap is different from other social networks because it's a ""camera company."" Tthat statement sounded reasonable because it produced special filters and lenses for smartphone cameras, but rivals like Instagram can easily make similar claims.

Snap's Spectacles. Image source: Snap.

Spiegel didn't say that Snap would sell physical cameras anytime soon, but the company launched its Spectacles Snap-capturing glasses late last year. The devices attracted lots of shoppers, thanks to a clever marketing campaign featuring vanishing vending machines .

If Snap builds upon that idea, it could start selling other cheap image capture devices to build its brand and differentiate itself from Instagram. However, that move could cause it to burn through its cash even faster and weigh down its bottom line with a low-margin hardware business.

Should you avoid Snap?

Snap looks like a company that went public before it formed a coherent roadmap toward positive cash flows and profitability. Without the ability to reach those goals, Snap remains an incredibly overvalued stock at nearly 60 times sales.

To put that into perspective, Facebook had a P/S ratio of about 10 at the close of its first trading day. Twitter ended its first day with a P/S ratio of about 11. This means that Snap could easily plummet to the single digits if investors realize that this ephemeral emperor has no clothes.

By far, the two biggest digital advertisers are Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) and Google, a subsidiary of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) . The two will combine to take 57% of the market this year. That's up from 54% last year as the two combine to take about 74% of all the growth in U.S. ad spend.

Even with the recent introduction of ads on the extremely popular Snapchat from Snap (NYSE: SNAP) and continued pressure from Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , the two giants continue to completely dominate the competition.

Google search takes $0.78 of every dollar

Google's biggest business, search, is also its biggest growth driver. Google's search ad revenue is expected to climb 16% this year compared to its overall revenue growth of 15%. eMarketer expects Google to take 78% of all U.S. search ad spend as it takes share from Microsoft and other smaller competitors. The search giant will bring in about $28.6 billion from search ads this year, according to the research group.

Google's growth stems largely from mobile. Android is the most popular mobile operating system in the U.S., and Google is the default search engine on iOS, the second most popular mobile operating system. Microsoft's efforts to penetrate the mobile market largely fell flat, although it is the search engine behind Siri on iOS.

Americans use Google for about 94% of their searches on mobile. As mobile continues to account for more and more of our time, Google's lead in search will only grow wider.

Facebook dominates display advertising

While Google grows more dominant in search, Facebook is increasingly dominant in display ads. eMarketer expects Facebook's U.S. advertising to grow 32.1% to $16.33 billion this year. Google is its next closest competitor, and it's expected to generate just $5.24 billion from display ads.

Image source: Facebook.

eMarketer's projection for U.S. ad revenue growth is actually below analysts' consensus estimate for Facebook's overall revenue growth this year. It's worth noting the U.S. is historically Facebook's largest and one of the faster-growing regions in terms of revenue. However, saturation in ad load could cause U.S. ad growth to slow more significantly compared to regions where Facebook has faster user growth.

Instagram will make a significant contribution to Facebook's U.S. ad revenue this year, growing to account for about 20% of Facebook's total on mobile, up from 15% last year. Mobile accounted for 84% of Facebook's total ad revenue last quarter.

The competition can't touch Facebook or Google

One of Facebook and Google's biggest competitors in display advertising, Twitter, is expected to see its mobile ad revenue decline for the first time in its history. Its revenue on mobile devices will fall about 5% to $1.15 billion, according to eMarketer. Mobile accounted for 89% of Twitter's total ad revenue in the fourth quarter.

The expected to decline comes after management provided anemic first-quarter guidance and followed it up by de-emphasizing certain ad products . Twitter is shifting its focus to its most profitable products in order to make good on its effort to become profitable this year.

Meanwhile, Snapchat is a growing force in video ads. Indeed, eMarketer expects the company's U.S. ad revenue to grow 158% to $770 million. Even with its robust growth, Snap's app revenue still only accounts for 1.2% of the total U.S. mobile ad market, and just 4% of the total growth in U.S. digital advertising.

Even with strong competition, Facebook and Google continue to dominate the market as users flock to their services. The trends favor both to continue growing faster than the rest of the industry for the foreseeable future, too.

Score one for civil liberties. This week, social networking giant Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) overhauled its privacy policies, blocking police departments from using the site as a means of keeping tabs on users who may also be associated with violent protesting.

On the surface, it may seem irrelevant to the current and future value of Facebook stock. Most members of the ad-driven platform know they're of no interest to law enforcement officials, and the protestors that were making themselves known on the social media site likely didn't know they were being watched (and therefore didn't alter the way and frequency with which they used the website).

In other words, so what ?

Thing is, it's more than conceivable there were enough users of the Facebook platform that had been steering clear due to privacy concerns - just on principle - to expect them to log on now that their privacy is being protected.

Privacy Remains Contentious Topic

It's neither a new debate, nor is it a minor one.

So, in the grand scheme of things, it's not difficult to believe that Facebook was looking the other way when it knew law enforcement officials were using its platform as a new tool in the war on crime.

The question Facebook stock holders should be asking: At what point does accommodating every policy and agency request make the website too alarming for even the average user to visit?

The American Civil Liberties Union asked the question, and then answered it in a way that put Facebook in a questionable light . The company responded with a change in its policy.

New Policies Curtail Pinpointing

As of Monday, police and other law enforcement agencies can no longer tap Geofeedia's data , which was built to pinpoint where Facebook users are - Facebook completely cut off Geofeedia's access to the site. It's not necessarily a permanent hurdle, but it is one that will remain in place indefinitely on the location-based analytics platform.

Facebook's deputy chief privacy officer Rob Sherman commented: ""Our goal is to make our policy explicit.""

New Page

The clarified policy does not preclude FB from assisting law enforcement officials on a case-by-case basis. Indeed, the company says it still intends to assist police when appropriate. Presumably, this would mean instances where a search warrant has been issued, which requires a reasonable suspicion that retrieving such information would help lead to a successful prosecution.

Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR ) and Facebook unit Instagram also booted Geofeedia from using their websites to gather and sell user information following the ACLU's exposure of the organization's invasive tactics.

Bottom Line for Facebook Stock

On the surface it seems like a potential setback for Facebook, and by extension for Facebook stock. One of the most compelling features of the social media platform to advertisers was the deep, broad, and well-defined data the company could collect about each and every user.

If it's scaling that detail back - and presumably it's doing so to more developers than just Geofeedia - then the potential value to advertisers is crimped.

Don't overthink it, though, and don't assume there's a cut-and-dried if/then relationship between how invasive a website can be and how valuable detailed user data is to an advertiser. They say they want stratification, but many advertisers are content to promote their product or service to any reasonably targeted consumer.

On the other hand, consumers are more apt to use caution when it comes to websites that may nefariously collect data on a consumer, even without their consent or knowledge. People have a decent sixth sense when it comes to being unreasonably monitored.

In other words, a FB that's more interested in basic civil rights is a better investment than one that's not. The trade-off is more than palatable.

3/17/2017,0.4173363,0.029151745,851.61,853.4,847.11,852.12,1716471,6.29,0.51,1,"Microsoft Corp. 's ( MSFT ) valuation has gone up by more than 20% in the last 12 months and the stock price is constantly near 52-week highs. There are several factors behind the new-found momentum of Microsoft stock , including reduced dependency on Windows revenue streams, a surging software-as-a-service portfolio and near triple-digit growth of the company's infrastructure-as-a-service offering, Microsoft Azure.

One major development in the last six months is the technology giant has decided to put all of its muscle behind its SaaS products, Office 365 and Dynamics 365. Microsoft is in an extremely strong position in the office collaboration market. The company recently announced there are 85 million monthly active Office 365 users around the world. The commercial monthly subscription cost per Office 365 user starts at $5 and goes above $30 for enterprise users, suggesting Microsoft is easily making more than half a billion dollars every month.

The important point to note here is Office commercial revenues have been growing above 50% for the past several quarters, with last quarter numbers coming in at 47%. If there was enough competition in the market, such high growth would not be easy to come by; and when you factor in the near 45% margin from by its Productivity and Business Processes segment, it is clear Microsoft has an above-average product with negligible market competition.

Alphabet Inc. 's ( GOOG ) ( GOOGL ) Google introduced several improvements to its productivity suite, known as G Suite, during the recent Google Cloud Next conference in San Francisco. Amazon ( AMZN ) is slowly stepping into the business productivity segment as well, recently having launched Amazon Chime, a Skype competitor.

The competition is slowly getting there, but the problem with productivity applications is users do not like moving to a new application after getting used to the existing one that is already working well for them. In addition, moving an entire company to new productivity tools is a disruptive experience, to say the least.

Although the objective of all collaboration software is essentially the same, products from different companies will have different features and functions. A global team that is familiar with Office 365 would find it extremely difficult to move to a competitor's product because the learning curve will be steep, and let's not forget the cost and difficulty involved in migrating to the new application suite.

With a base of 85 million users (more than one-fourth the size of Twitter 's (NYSE: TWTR ) user base), Office 365 is possibly one of the most-used commercial SaaS applications in the world, and it is growing fast. Similar to the lead Amazon has in cloud service, the advantage Microsoft has over competitors in regard to Office 365 will make it extremely hard to compete with.

The fact Microsoft has managed to draw attention away from its Windows licensing revenues to its newer cloud-based revenues alone is proof the company has transitioned nicely into the new growth segment.

The company will still face some cannibalization of revenues - because every new Office 365 customer is one customer lost to its standalone Office application - but the beauty of getting users to subscribe to SaaS applications is Microsoft will now be able to keep adding new functions and services on a regular basis, expanding its portfolio and revenues.

In a 6-page order , Judge Lucy Koh told Google ( goog ) and class action attorneys the proposed settlement was insufficient, in part because it failed to clearly tell consumers what the search giant had done.

""This notice is difficult to understand and does not clearly disclose the fact that Google intercepts, scans and analyzes the content of emails sent by non-Gmail users to Gmail users for the purpose of creating user profiles of the Gmail users to create targeted advertising for the Gmail users,"" Koh wrote.

The case is the latest twist in a long-running legal fight over whether Google's email scanning practices amount to illegal wiretaps and a violation of California privacy laws. Even though this scanning is automated—and doesn't amount to Google employees poking around emails—critics say the practice is akin to AT&T listening in on people's phone calls or the United States Postal Service reading personal letters.

Google won a related lawsuit several years ago involving Gmail users who had signed up for the the service. The 2015 case is different, however, because it involves people who use other email providers—such as Microsoft ( msft ) or Yahoo ( yhoo ) —but whose messages are scanned without their permission when they send an email to a Gmail users.

Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.

As part of the proposed settlement, Google agreed to change the way it scans incoming messages so that it no longer reads emails while they are in transit, but only when they are in someone's inbox. The change amounts to a technicality but the company and the class action lawyers agree it puts Google in the clear as far as wiretap laws.

Judge Koh, however, said she's not so sure about that. Her ruling claims the settlement does not provide an adequate technical explanation of Google's workaround, which involves scanning in-transit emails for security purposes, and then later parsing them for advertising data.

""It does not disclose that Google will scan the email of non-Gmail users while the emails are in transit for the “dual purpose” of creating user profiles and targeted advertising and for detecting spam and malware,"" Koh wrote.

The judge also added that another settlement last year, involving Yahoo's scanning of emails, did not reflect the facts of the Google case.

The upshot is that Koh wants the case to proceed further and for the class action lawyers to push Google for recent documents about how the email scanning process really works. As the judge notes, the current settlement relies on documents that are three to six years old.

Any future settlement will presumably also have to do more to inform email users about Google's scanning practices and, possibly, direct some of the settlement money to consumers instead of only the lawyers. Under the deal Koh rejected, Google would have paid $2.2 million to the attorneys, plus up to $140,000 in online ads to publicize the agreement.

Koh's concerns reflect a sore point among many, including judges, who feel a long string of privacy settlements with big tech companies have done little to compensate consumers or improve privacy.

In 2017, Google became the most valuable brand in the world, topping Apple, according to the Brand Finance Global 500 report. Google’s position is due mainly to its core business as a search engine and its ability to transform users into payers via advertising.

About 32 percent of Google visitors come from the US, where the company holds 63.9 percent of the search engine market, according to statista.com. Google had 247 million unique US users in November 2015. Globally, it boasts 1.5 billion search engine users and more than 1 billion users of Gmail.

Google data centers process an average of 40 million searches per second, resulting in 3.5 billion searches per day and 1.2 trillion searches per year, Internet Live Stats reports. That’s up from 795.2 million searcher per year in 1999, one year after Google was launched.

In a reorganization in October 2015, Google became a subsidiary of a new company it created called Alphabet. Since then, several projects have been canceled or scaled back, including the halt of further rollout of Google Fiber. Following the reorg, however, Google has placed a lot of focus (and dedicated a lot of resources) to selling cloud services to enterprises, going head-to-head against the market giant Amazon Web Services and the second-largest player in the space, Microsoft Azure.

That has meant a major expansion of Google data centers specifically to support those cloud services. At the Google Cloud Next conference in San Francisco in March 2017, the company’s execs revealed that it spent nearly $30 billion on data centers over the preceding three years. While the company already has what is probably the world’s largest cloud, it was not built to support enterprise cloud services. To do that, the company needs to have data centers in more locations, and that’s what it has been doing, adding new locations to support cloud services and adding cloud data center capacity wherever it makes sense in existing locations.

Here are some of the most frequently asked questions about Google data centers and our best stab at answering them:

Where are Google Data Centers Located?

Google lists eight data center locations in the U.S., one in South America, four in Europe and two in Asia. Its cloud sites, however, are expanding, and Google’s cloud map shows many points of presence worldwide. The company also has many caching sites in colocation facilities throughout the world, whose locations it does not share.

This far-flung network is necessary not only to support operations than run 24/7, but to meet specific regulations (like the EU’s privacy regulations) of certain regions and to ensure business continuity in the face of risks like natural disasters.

In the works as of March 2017, are Google data centers for cloud services in California, Canada, The Netherlands, Northern Virginia, São Paulo, London, Finland, Frankfurt, Mumbai, Singapore, and Sydney.

Here are the data center sites listed by Google:

North America:

South America

Asia

Europe

How Big are Google Data Centers?

A paper presented during the IEEE 802.3bs Task Force in May 2014 estimates the size of five of Google’s US facilities as:

Pryor Creek (Mayes County), Oklahoma , 980,000 square feet

Lenoir, North Carolina, 337,000 square feet

The Dalles, Oregon, 200,000 square feet (before the 2016, 164,000 square foot expansion)

Council Bluff, Iowa, 200,000 square feet

Berkely County, South Carolina, 200,000 square feet.

Many of these sites have multiple data center buildings, as Google prefers to build additional structures as sites expand rather than containing operations in a single massive building.

Google itself doesn’t disclose the size of its data centers. Instead, it mentions the cost of the sites or number of employees. Sometimes, facility size slips out. For example, the announcement about the opening of The Dalles in Oregon said the initial building was 164,000 square feet. The size of subsequent expansions, however, has been kept tightly under wraps.

Reports discussing Google’s new data center in Emeshaven, Netherlands, which opened December 2016, didn’t mention size. Instead, they said the company has contracted for the entire 62 Megawatt output of a nearby windfarm and ran 9,941 miles of computer cable within the facility. The data center employs 150 people.

How Many Servers Does Google Have?

There’s no official data on how many servers there are in Google data centers, but Gartner estimated in a July 2016 report that Google at the time had 2.5 million servers. This number, of course, is always changing as the company expands capacity and refreshes its hardware.

A serious cockup at the Chocolate Factory caused an over-the-air (OTA) downgrade to people who had side-loaded Android 7.1.1, dropping them back to Android 7.0 and sending their phones into meltdown.

“It makes no sense,"" complained someone calling themselves the Crazy Android Monster. ""[My phone] was on 7.1.1 – it had been sideloaded a couple months ago. The update said 7.0. The update went through and nearly everything in the OS now crashes. I am going to have to sideload the latest factory image.”

The crashes aren’t surprising: the correct downgrade path on a ‘droid is wipe and factory reset, not, well, a weird OTA.

Google finally chimed in on Wednesday to ‘fess up: “There was a recent OTA update for Android 7.0 that is causing confusion for some Nexus 6 users. For those of you that want to guarantee future OTA updates, you will need to get back on the 7.0 supported track. If you are experiencing issues after accepting the 7.0 update, please factory reset your device to help resolve any problems.

“For any Nexus 6 users that want to continue flashing/sideloading future builds, you can stay on 7.1.1 and continue to do so.”

Unpicking Google’s contribution: having accidentally sent an OTA for 7.0 to users on 7.1.1, those who blinked at the wrong moment and pressed “install” now have to run a factory reset; and if they want to get future OTAs, they need to be good children and stick with the 7.0 track.

However: if this Google blog post from January was correct, Nexus 6 isn’t on the list for future OTA upgrades.

Either way, the screwed-over and irritated fandroids have to factory reset, choose whether they’re going to re-install Android 7.0 or 7.1.1, and remember not to press “install” on future OTA upgrades that they probably won’t receive. ®",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After releasing it exclusively to Prime members in late 2014, the device proved so popular that Amazon was able to quickly open orders to everyone in the U.S. by the following summer. On Christmas Eve of 2015, the Echo was one of the top five items ordered, according to Amazon's annual holiday press release. Last year, Echo device sales climbed nine times compared to 2015's holiday season.

That's despite the November introduction of Google Home, a competing smart speaker from the Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary. During Alphabet's fourth-quarter earnings call, RBC analyst Mark Mahaney suggested Echo devices, powered by the virtual assistant Alexa, outsold Google Home 10-to-1 in the quarter.

But Mahaney is changing his tune after conducting a more in-depth survey. ""Home's awareness and installed base could be much closer to Alexa -- with a brand awareness in the U.S. 80% that of Alexa and an installed base that may be close to a third that of Alexa,"" he recently wrote in a note.

It looks like Google Home is quickly catching up to Amazon's Echo.

Google plans to keep investing in Google Home

Google plans to keep making Google Home a better device by improving its search capabilities and functionality. ""We are going to invest a lot in it over 2017,"" Google CEO Sundar Pichai told investors on Alphabet's fourth-quarter earnings call. ""I think there is a lot of work ahead to make all of this work well for users. And this is the core area where we've invested in for the very long term,"" he added.

Google intends to leverage its massive Android platform to continue improving Google Assistant, the artificial intelligence (AI) behind Google Home. At least 200 million devices will have access to the voice assistant, which will provide Google with a lot more opportunities to learn exactly what people are looking for when they say, ""OK, Google.""

Google will also have to improve Google Home's capabilities. The device currently has around 80 Actions, which is nothing compared to the 10,000-plus functionalities available with Alexa. To that end, Google launched the Actions on Google developer kit in December.

Strategy Analytics estimates Google will sell 1 million Google Home devices by midyear. That still trails Amazon's sales by a significant margin. The research group estimates Amazon sold 6.3 million Echo devices last year, and that should go up meaningfully in 2017. Mahaney estimates Amazon will sell 60 million Echo devices by 2020, bringing the install base to 128 million.

Google still doesn't know how to monetize voice search

While Google Home sales are improving relative to Amazon Echo, it's not clear device sales will follow a similar path. Google Home lacks one of the key functionalities of Amazon's devices: the ability to easily shop on Amazon.

Seventeen percent of Echo owners use Alexa to place orders on Amazon, according to Mahaney's survey. As the number of devices in use grows, Mahaney expects the amount of shopping done via Alexa on Amazon to grow as well. By 2020, sales through the voice assistant could reach $5 billion, according to the analyst's estimate.

Google doesn't even have a business model for monetizing Google Home beyond hardware sales. Search and display ads don't work very well on a device with no display.

Moreover, Google doesn't offer a compelling differentiating factor for consumers to pick its device over another smart speaker. Comparatively, Amazon Prime members, of which there's a rapidly growing number , have lots of reasons to pick the Echo, like easy access to ordering things on Amazon or inexpensive use of Amazon Music Unlimited.

As such, Amazon is poised to win the long-term competition even if Google Home is catching up in the short term.

Among venture capitalists a ""down round"" is defined as funding in a private company that carries a lower valuation than the previous investment.

It means a company's investors are taking a loss. That's what is likely to happen when Uber goes public.

Right now, Uber is said to be worth $69 billion after taking losses of $2.2 billion during the first nine months of 2016. Its 2016 revenues were estimated at $5.5 billion, and it is not unusual for fast-growing companies to sustain losses as they invest to keep the growth going.

Valuing a company at 12.5 times revenue when it seems to be at the peak of its performance may seem to make sense for wealthy Silicon Valley investors, but here in the real world, we have a word for that kind of offer, and the word is no.

Trouble Ahead, Trouble Behind for Uber

Uber drivers are not employees. They are, in theory, business partners who pay Uber a commission to bring them work driving people around. They are unlicensed taxi drivers who don't pay for medallions and are thus subject to harassment by the government.

But the Uber drivers I have met are incredibly professional, and their cars are clean, thanks in part to a ""Vehicle Solutions"" program that lets them rent, lease or buy new or nearly new cars. This is how the company has grown.

But relying on contractors carries risks . Uber is said to have a ""toxic"" work culture, one rife with sexual abuse , leading to a Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR ) campaign advocating that customers delete the app .

CEO Travis Kalanick described his corporate culture as ""baller,"" and once joked to a magazine that calling the company ""Boober"" was fine because it got him sex.

Pando Daily founder Sarah Lacy has been an especially harsh critic , and political polarization now seems to be having an effect, as rival Lyft has reportedly grown 7% in just the last two months, although both companies have seen less traffic lately .

Self-Driving Mess

For investors, Uber's biggest risk may lie in its efforts to get into the self-driving car business.

Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ), the parent of Google and Waymo , a self-driving car pioneer, has filed a legal complaint charging that Uber stole Waymo's trade secrets by having an employee walk out with them, founding a company called Otto, then buying Otto for $700 million. If Alphabet wins the case, it could take Uber completely out of that business.

Uber is also challenging Google Maps, pushing its own system on drivers , one that will make their driving fit corporate needs. It also gives the company a direct online connection to drivers.

Uber's fraught relations with competitors, drivers and government is now a global phenomenon . Competition from new entrants is also increasing, even in Africa.

The Bottom Line

Buying Uber stock is based on a belief that the company will grow, but it's more likely that Uber is now at the replacement end of the curve, where growth slows down.

Buying Uber in hopes of getting into the self-driving ""cars as a service"" craze is also risky, because Uber's ownership of the necessary intellectual property is under question.

The risk of venture capitalists holding companies through their period of maximum growth is always that they will hold on too long, that they will be unable to exit the investment on their own timetable - that they will, in the end, get too greedy.

That's what has happened here. When Uber goes public, wait for all lock-up periods to expire before considering an investment. See what its full value is before you buy. Don't bet on the hype of the IPO. Treat Uber as the mature company it is.

The Nasdaq-100 is posting new highs, and it's being led higher by companies like Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ). To most traders, though, it would seem like it's too late to initiate a long position in GOOGL stock by purchasing shares at $870.

Luckily, you and I have the options markets.

With GOOGL options, we can design trades that allow for a margin of error. That would give us a lot more confidence going forward; otherwise, our stops would kick in on the first few red days.

Less than 30 days ago, I shared a trade that was designed to be a sure thing . Almost $4 per contract in profits came fast. Today, with those profits in my pocket, I want to ""range trade"" Alphabet stock instead. We could all use a little speculative risk in our portfolio.

The short story of Alphabet is that fundamentally it's as solid as it gets. It's the king of search, and that's a cash cow that just keeps getting fatter. So with a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 30, GOOGL's potential is built in somewhat … but I think it's not fully built in. I think what people are forgetting is that Alphabet can still monetize the billions of users on the Android OS much better than it already is.

Technically speaking, Alphabet stock is at all-time highs, but still has room to run. I'd just expect some resistance first.

How to Trade GOOGL Stock

The bullish side: Sell the GOOGL 13 Apr $845/$842.5 credit put spread for 40 cents per contract. We have an 80% chance that price will stay above my strike where we need it.

The bearish side: Sell the GOOGL 13 Apr $887.5/$890 credit call spread for an additional 60 cents per contract. Here, given the upside potential in markets, our chances of success are around 75%.

Taking both trades would constitute a sold iron condor for a total $1 in credit. Since we can only lose on one side or the other, our max risk drops, thereby raising my potential yield above 60% on risk. This trade's delta is much higher than my usual points of entry, and that's what makes it a speculative setup in GOOGL stock.

In this market, I know we'll need to tightly manage this iron condor. So we shouldn't risk more money than we can afford to lose.

They're social-media powerhouse Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) and messaging platform Line Corporation (NYSE: LN) .

Line made its public debut last July, so the sample size of its trading history is minuscule. However, in the months since its IPO, the respective fortunes of Line and Facebook have diverged to a meaningful degree.

LN data by YCharts

Of course, this only tells any investor a fraction of what he or she needs to know. Let's examine three important aspects of Facebook's and Line's investment narratives, to figure out which stock is the better buy today.

Financial fortitude

The comparison of financial might between Line and Facebook is an instance of David versus Goliath. Look at these four important measures of solvency and liquidity for both companies:

Winner: Facebook.

Durable competitive advantages

The size contrast between Facebook and Line continues in examining their durable competitive advantages.

As of its most recent earnings report, Facebook counted 1.86 billion monthly active users (MAUs) on its core social-networking platform, or about 58% of the world's population that has access to the internet. Beyond this, Facebook owns other social-media platforms and messaging services, such as Instagram (600 million MAUs), Facebook Messenger (1 billion MAUs), and WhatsApp (1 billion MAUs), that are seeing large and growing user counts as well. This immense base of users has allowed Facebook to create the most powerful digital advertising this side of Alphabet . Better still, Facebook is moving into emerging areas of technology, including virtual reality, artificial intelligence, live digital video streaming, and much more. Facebook, in short, has quickly ascended to become one of the most important technology companies on the face of the earth.

Line, on the other hand, is far smaller. As of its most recent earnings report, the company counted 217 million monthly active users on its messaging platform, though 76% of its users are concentrated in just four core markets: Japan, Thailand, Taiwan, and Indonesia. Worse, its user growth declined sequentially from 220 million in its Q3 report, suggesting that Line may be feeling pressure from larger global messaging platforms -- like the ones Facebook owns. The company has moved aggressively to monetize its users through products such as paid stickers, games, and a host of other mobile apps, but the jury remains out on whether Line can translate its regional strength in messaging into a sustainable long-term business. Compared with Facebook, it's clear which company enjoys more substantial durable competitive advantages.

Winner: Facebook.

Valuation

A meaningful gap exists between Facebook's and Line's valuations, and for good reason. First, look at three of the most commonly used valuation metrics for both companies:

Company P/E Forward P/E EV/EBITDA Facebook 39.1 20.4 24.7 Line Corp. 111.8 34.6 34.3

Data source: Yahoo! Finance.

Again, Facebook beats Line across all three valuation statistics. Comparing this performance to their projected future growth rates, analysts estimate that Facebook's earnings per share will grow at an average annual rate of 23.5% over the next five years, versus 39.3% for Line -- which has only one sell-side analyst covering its stock at the moment. I think the key question here is to what extent investors believe in Line's monetization capabilities. If Line can indeed grow its EPS at such above-average rates, Line shares could do quite well. However, the cracks that have emerged in its user growth story give me pause. So let's call this section a draw and move on.

Winner: Tie.

And the winner is... Facebook

Facebook remains undeniably stronger than Line, even factoring in Line's higher estimated future growth rates. The Asian messaging platform still has plenty of questions to answer about whether it can continue to expand its uses. On the other hand, Facebook is one of the most powerful and iconic companies in all of tech. It stands as the better buy between the two today.

Most recently, market researcher eMarketer lowered its expectations for Snap's U.S. ad revenue from $800 million to $770 million. The reason behind the lower estimate is ""higher-than-estimated revenue sharing with partners.""

Snapchat offers revenue sharing as an incentive for content publishers to use its Publisher Stories (formerly Discover) format. Snap is also partnering with various media companies to produce original shows, which may provide even more favorable revenue share for the content producer.

Let's take a look at how revenue sharing affects Snap's financials.

Image source: Snap/Author.

Revenue sharing doesn't impact Snap's top line

While eMarketer is lowering its expectations for Snapchat, the actual decline in net ad revenue won't show up in Snap's top line. Snap reports gross revenue similarly to how Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) reports Google's revenue. Google lumps in revenue from its network partners with its search and YouTube revenue, and then accounts for revenue sharing as part of its traffic acquisition costs.

The amount of revenue Snap shares with its publisher partners is then reported as an item in the company's cost of revenue. So, eMarketer may have well said it expects Snap's cost of revenue to come in $30 million higher than originally anticipated.

Snap's Publisher Stories. Image source: Snap.

Last year, Snap says revenue sharing payments increased $48.2 million from 2015, but it doesn't provide a specific amount it paid to partners. That does at least provide a floor, and it's nearly 12% of Snap's $404.5 million in total revenue last year.

For comparison, Google paid out $10.9 billion in revenue sharing to its network partners (not including YouTube) in 2016. That's almost 14% of its total ad revenue for the year.

Revenue sharing may increase even faster

While most analysts expect Snap to grow its top line to around $1 billion this year, its path to that mark may mean less of that revenue makes it past the second line (cost of revenue) on its income statement. Snap has inked several high-profile deals with media companies over the last year.

It already has deals in place with NBC, ABC, BBC, Turner, New York Time, Discovery, Time, A+E Networks, and VICE to produce original shows for Snapchat. Snap is still actively pursuing these high-profile deals.

It's important to note that Snap says its revenue-sharing arrangements ""generally do not contain minimum financial commitments to our publisher partners and are generally not tied to specific events or promotions."" That seems to indicate Snap doesn't pay anything up front for these productions, but Snap may help out with the costs as ""content creation costs"" also show up in management's description of cost of revenue. Content creation costs include personnel-related costs, according to Snap's S-1.

With the growth of the Publisher Stories platform, investors should expect a stark increase in cost of goods sold due to revenue-sharing and content-creation costs.

Cost of revenue is already under scrutiny

Snap posted a negative gross margin last year as its cost of revenue overshadowed its revenue. The biggest factor behind it is Snap's hosting expenses, for which it primarily relies on Google Cloud. It's already committed to spending $3 billion in total on cloud infrastructure over the next five years, which will continue to put pressure on Snap's gross margin as it tries to scale.

Add to that the fact that one of its revenue drivers is growing content from publisher partners, which contributes to even more cost of revenue. While a few tens of millions of dollars is relatively small compared to the hundreds of millions Snap is spending with its cloud partners each year, Snap's margins are so thin that every dollar counts.

To most traders, though, it would seem like it’s too late to initiate a long position in GOOGL stock by purchasing shares at $870.

Luckily, you and I have the options markets.

With GOOGL options, we can design trades that allow for a margin of error. That would give us a lot more confidence going forward; otherwise, our stops would kick in on the first few red days.

Less than 30 days ago, I shared a trade that was designed to be a sure thing. Almost $4 per contract in profits came fast. Today, with those profits in my pocket, I want to “range trade” Alphabet stock instead. We could all use a little speculative risk in our portfolio.

The short story of Alphabet is that fundamentally it’s as solid as it gets. It’s the king of search, and that’s a cash cow that just keeps getting fatter. So with a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 30, GOOGL’s potential is built in somewhat … but I think it’s not fully built in. I think what people are forgetting is that Alphabet can still monetize the billions of users on the Android OS much better than it already is.

Technically speaking, Alphabet stock is at all-time highs, but still has room to run. I’d just expect some resistance first.

For now, then, this is what we’ll do.

How to Trade GOOGL Stock

The bullish side: Sell the GOOGL 13 Apr $845/$842.5 credit put spread for 40 cents per contract. We have an 80% chance that price will stay above my strike where we need it.

The bearish side: Sell the GOOGL 13 Apr $887.5/$890 credit call spread for an additional 60 cents per contract. Here, given the upside potential in markets, our chances of success are around 75%.

Taking both trades would constitute a sold iron condor for a total $1 in credit. Since we can only lose on one side or the other, our max risk drops, thereby raising my potential yield above 60% on risk. This trade’s delta is much higher than my usual points of entry, and that’s what makes it a speculative setup in GOOGL stock.

In this market, I know we’ll need to tightly manage this iron condor. So we shouldn’t risk more money than we can afford to lose.

While all the major mobile device providers – Apple, Google, and Amazon included – offer parental controls on their devices – Family Link is different because it’s a two-party system. Instead, it works more like the third-party parental control and monitoring software already on the market, where an app installed on a parent’s device is used to configure settings and keep an eye on kids’ digital behavior.

For the system to work, Family Link requires that both parent and child use Android. The parent will first download the Family Link mobile app to their own device, running Android KitKat (4.4) or higher. An iOS version is not yet available, says Google.

From this app, parents will set up the child’s Google account. It’s designed to be used for those children under the age of 13, Google notes.

Then, on the kid’s device, the child signs in using these new credentials. The child’s phone or tablet must be running either Android Nougat (7.0), or a supported device running Marshmallow (6.1). (A full list is here in the Family Link FAQ.)

Once signed in, the child’s phone usage is tracked and logged, so parents can see how much time kids spend in various apps, via weekly and monthly activity reports. From the parent’s app, moms and dads can set a number of rules for their kids, including how long kids are allowed to be on their mobile devices every day, at what time the devices can no longer be used that day (through a remote locking feature), and which apps can be installed.

Parents can approve or block apps the child wants to download from the Google Play Store, much like how Apple’s iCloud Family Sharing’s “Ask” feature works today.

Like Apple, Google doesn’t offer any suggestions as to whether a given app should be approved, however – that decision is left up to the parents’ discretion.

Explains Google:

“[Family Link] can’t make the apps or services on their phone that were designed for adults kid-safe; it’s up to parents to choose what’s right for their kid.”

A lack of guidance is one of the gaping holes with many parental control systems today. That’s unfortunate given that all the app stores have app ratings. It seems that simply highlighting the rating to parents during the “Ask” process could go a long way to helping parents make better decisions.

That being said, Family Link does allow parents to at least remotely configure the filtering options for some of Google’s own apps, like the Google Search app and the Chrome browser. This will protect kids from adult content and other inappropriate material when doing web searches.

Plus, having standalone application that lets parents remotely configure a variety of control mechanisms for children’s devices will be generally helpful, and could become a selling point for Android phones and tablets.

Family Link isn’t yet broadly available. Google is offering early access to testers willing to try the service during this early preview, and provide feedback.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The answer may very well be ""No,"" depending on your office environment and how long you've been with a company.

Getting to know your colleagues on a more personal level can be a long process that takes months, if not years. But having meaningful work relationships pay off. Employees who have friends at work are happier and work harder at work, a national Gallup poll found.

To fast-track the process of building meaningful work relationships, Peter Roper, Google's head of mobile brand strategy, asks his employees fun ice-breaker questions.

Some of his favorite are these three: ""What's on your bucket list?"" ""What's the craziest thing you've done?"" and ""What's your favorite color?""

These unusual questions, which Roper occasionally asks at team meetings, get people out of their comfort zones and encourage them to share personal interests. That often sparks more meaningful connections.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(RTTNews.com) - Google has introduced a new way of sending or requesting money. You can now use the Gmail app for Android, which has Google Wallet integration.

It is similar to sending payments via Google Wallet through Gmail on the web, a feature that is available for quite a while now.

Sending money in Gmail is as easy as sending any other attachment like a photo, video or document. Just tap on the attachment icon and choose whether you want to send or request money.

Recipients will be able to receive or request the money right from the email itself and they are not required to install another payment app. They can even arrange for money to be transferred directly into their bank account.

The feature is completely free for both the sender and recipient, which is an advantage compared to the fees that come with mobile apps like Venmo or Square Cash.

However, the new feature is currently available only in the U.S. only on Gmail on the web or Android.

(RTTNews.com) - Google is ready to throttle background tabs in its Chrome 57 version to check battery life. Background tabs usually need more energy and consume up to a third of Chrome's power.

Earlier in September Google has revealed its efforts to throttle badly behaved pages such as JavaScript ads, analytic scripts, etc. Such pages would consume a lot of CPU even when they are at the background, affecting browser performance and battery life.

Google has planned to allocate or budget each web-view in seconds for running timers in the background. If a background tab has live budgeted seconds then it will be allowed to use the CPU. Whenever the budget expires its access to CPU will be seized.

Google said that web developers should be aware that a lot of tabs can have serious effect on power usage and battery life. The tech giant instructed developers that the work in the background should be kept to a minimum, unless it is absolutely necessary to provide a particular user experience.

The deflation of the Twilio Inc (NYSE: TWLO ) IPO has certainly been stunning. The company pulled off its offering in June at $15 a share and within a few months, the price hit a nose-bleed $69. But then there was an avalanche of selling with Twilio stock. As of now, the price is at $31.

Despite all this, TWLO has continued to grow at a rapid pace. In the latest quarter , the revenues jumped by 60% to $82 million, as the number of active customer accounts went from 34,457 to 36,606.

In fact, Twilio beat the Street consensus. The company also forecasted that the growth ramp would continue throughout the year.

But it was not enough to get TWLO stock back into gear. For the most part, Twilio stock has been trading in a tight range.

So might there be an opportunity? Perhaps TWLO stock has bottomed out and is poised for a move on the upside? Well, to see, let's take a look at three pros and three cons:

Three Pros to Twilio Stock

Powerful Platform : TWLO has a suite of powerful cloud-based applications, allowing for SMS, chat, voice calling and video. A developer can easily embed this technology into an app, providing access to a sophisticated communications network.

The business model is also enticing. That is, payments are only required when there is usage of the Twilio service.

As a result, the company has been able to quickly attract developers. Note that there are over 1 million accounts.

Going Upmarket : TWLO has an Enterprise Plan, which is focused on large customers that have tough requirements for compliance, security and administration. A key part of this was the recent granting of ISO 27001 certification, which is a global standard for security.

While still in the early stages, the Enterprise Plan is showing encouraging results. For example, in the latest quarter TWLO snagged a major airline as well as Capital One Financial Corp . (NYSE: COF ) and the Blue Cross Blue Shield companies.

According to CEO Jeff Lawson, on the most recent earnings call : ""We are seeing really good response in terms of the enterprise. Again, I would say this is our developer first model at play where developers are the ones bringing Twilio into the enterprise just like they've brought us into a number of different types of technology first companies.""

Growth Opportunity : Companies like Uber, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG ,NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) have raised the bar when it comes to apps and cloud technologies. Customers have come to expect that they can get quick service with just a few taps.

This is where TWLO is so powerful. The company's systems can easily allow for must-have features to remain competitive.

So in light of this, it should be no surprise that the market opportunity for Twilio stock is enormous. According to research from IDC , it's estimated at about $45.4 billion.

Three Cons to Twilio Stock

Competition : It's certainly fierce. Just some of the rivals include Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO ), Vonage Holdings Corp. (NYSE: VG ), CallFire, Nexmo and Bandwidth.com. In fact, some of TWLO's own customers could wind up being competitors, such as Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ). And telecom operators like AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T ) and Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ ) could leverage their own networks to take on TWLO.

Granted, the low-price strategy of the company has probably been a key in maintaining marketshare. But then again, this may make it tough for it to ultimately get to profitability on a GAAP basis.

Customer Concentration : It is fairly heavy. Last year about 30% of revenues came from only 10 customers. Keep in mind that FB's WhatsApp represented 9% and Uber was over 10%. It's important to note that TWLO also generally allows customers to terminate their contracts at any time.

Now this is not to say that these customers will suddenly bolt. Again, TWLO has continued to invest in R&D and to provide strong service.

Yet there are still risks. Let's face it, large companies can certainly leverage their power to exact better terms, especially when there are alternatives available.

Valuation : Even with the plunge in Twilio stock, the multiple is still at hefty levels. Note that the price-to-sales ratio is roughly 10X. Even for a fast-growing cloud company, this is steep.

Take a look at some of the valuations in the industry:

Bottom Line on TWLO stock

(NYSE: NEWR ) 8X(NYSE: BOX ) 5.3X(NASDAQ: APTI ) 3X

Twilio definitely has a strong platform and it has continued to innovate it. Going forward, the company should benefit from the megatrends of cloud computing and mobile.

But for now, it's probably best not to take a position in TWLO stock as the valuation remains fairly high. Let's face it, there are cheaper alternatives available when it comes to fast-growing enterprise plays, such as NEWR, BOX or APTI.

Last year, the social network's sequential monthly active user growth stalled and even temporarily turned negative. Meanwhile, Twitter's revenue growth rates have decelerated rapidly and its stock price has plummeted nearly 70% in two years.

Going further, there isn't a clear end in sight to Twitter's revenue challenges. A new report by research company eMarketer (via Recode ) forecasts Twitter's U.S. mobile ad revenue will actually decline in 2017 compared to 2016 as Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) and Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google gobble up marketers' rising spending on mobile advertisements.

Twitter's missed opportunity

In 2017, Twitter's U.S. mobile advertising revenue will decline from $1.21 billion last year to $1.15 billion, eMarketer estimates. A quick glance at Twitter's financials in the company's most recent quarter suggests this estimate is realistic. Twitter's $382 million in U.S. advertising revenue in Q4 was down 7% from the year-ago period. And given that 89% of Twitter's global ad revenue during the quarter came from mobile, it's safe to say that Twitter's mobile ad revenue in the U.S. probably isn't faring too well.

What's unfortunate about Twitter's struggling mobile ad business in the U.S. is that it's happening at a time when marketers are spending more on mobile ads. Total mobile ad spend in the U.S. is expected to increase 25% in 2017 compared to 2016, eMarketer estimates.

Unlike Twitter, advertising juggernauts Google and Facebook are well-positioned to snap-up this incremental spending. The two companies' combined share of U.S. mobile ad spend will increase from 54% in 2016 to 57% in 2017, eMarketer estimates. But eMarketer estimates that Twitter's share of U.S. mobile advertising revenue will decline from 2.6% in 2016 to 2% in 2017.

Twitter management likely agrees that it won't be keeping up with Google's or Facebook's growth rate in 2017. In the company's fourth-quarter shareholder letter, management said, ""escalating competition for digital ad spending"" could present challenges for advertising revenue growth in 2017.

Image source: Twitter.

Can Twitter reinvigorate growth?

Looking further into the future -- perhaps toward the end of 2017 and into 2018 -- Twitter's domestic advertising revenue could start growing again. Management believes that the company's recent reacceleration in user growth will drive revenue growth. But it's going to take time as management expects ""advertising revenue growth to continue to lag that of audience growth in 2017,"" the company explained in its fourth-quarter shareholder letter.

But if Twitter does return to mobile ad growth in the U.S. toward the end of the year or in 2018, don't expect growth rates to be very high. Not only may overall growth in U.S.-based mobile ad spend be much slower by then, but Twitter's anemic 3% year-over-year growth in U.S. monthly active users during the company's most recent quarter -- notably below Facebook's 5.5% year-over-year growth in U.S. monthly active users in the same period -- suggests the user growth won't be much help for Twitter in driving domestic ad revenue growth.

Family Link is a new way for parents and their children to be connected on Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG ,NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and its online capabilities.

The service essentially allows your children to have a Google account in a safe way. Here are seven things to know about it

Family Link is an app that allows you to have a joint Google account with your kid.

In order to access it, you will need the app, an Android phone running Android KitKat 4.4 or higher (for yourself), and a newer Android phone running Nougat (for your kid).

The two phones will be in sync following this move and the parent will be able to keep tabs on what the kid is doing.

Kids can use the app to play games and watch movies.

Family Link makes it easy for parents ages 13 and under to approve or block apps, set daily screen limits, see how much time they're spending weekly or monthly, and lock their devices when it's time to take a break or go to bed.

Parents can monitor their kids settings remotely through their own device, see the location of their child's device and more.

You can also set a new unlock code if your kid forgets theirs in order to make sure they can be connected whenever they want, unless you don't want them to.

GOOG stock and GOOGL stock grew 0.2% and 0.3% respectively.

In late after hours trading, I see the stock at $33.39 up $2.76 or about 9%.

Estimates Likely Moving Higher

When a company raises guidance over the consensus you can expect the analysts to adjust their models. These models help them derive their earnings estimates which are used in the Zacks Rank. Since there haven't been any earnings revisions over the last 60 days, ALRM is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). In the coming days I anticipate the stock to see several upward revisions which should help boost the Zacks Rank for this stock to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) or a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Acquisitions

ALRM made a few recent acquisitions and they were touched on during the conference call. During the call, management talked about how the ObjectVideo acquisition will allow customers to track cars and license plates or even customers in a store.

The Icontrol Networks deal closed in the quarter and the company mentioned how the Piper unit powers a portion of the ADT platform. The industry had been viewed as ""we versus ADT"" but that has changed with the advent of customer home protection services offered by cable companies.

An analyst questioned if the company was looking to a product offering around cars, and while the company would not commit on a specific answer, it was clear that it could be something coming down the road. Many times during the call management noted that they were maintaining a healthy level of spending for R&D. Having an expandable platform is key because the security business has been changing very rapidly.

Outlook

As we think about the changes in home security, it is clear that people are adding devices and services thanks to the relative ease of the internet. Management noted on the call that people want these products and services to come from one source.

As an example, I have a Google Cam (formerly Dropcam) and while it is accessible via its own app I would like to see it be usable via my Amazon echo. Yes the Google Nest is controllable via the voice recognizing tool, but I would like more functionality. I often search on Amazon for devices that are compatible with Alexa since I have power out that is controlled by another company. It too has its own app and with only a few devices having multiple apps is already a pressure point for me.

With the strong revenue guidance, management believes that its products and services will be well received by customers.

Analysts Notes Coming

As I look at where most recommendations are, I see a few potential upgrades tomorrow. Goldman Sachs started coverage of the stock with a Neutral rating on January 31 and a $31 price target. The analyst for the firm asked about the potential for organic growth from Icontrol which allowed management to talk about how they were going to hold their cost structure constant and could expect about $66M in EBITDA which translates to better than 20% margin. It is possible that Goldman Sachs ups the stock to ""Buy"" tomorrow.

Raymond James downgraded the stock back on August 16 as the moved their rating to Market Perform from Outperform. Imperial Capital has the stock as ""In-line"" with a $30 price target.

Roth Capital started coverage on October 3 with a buy and a $33.50 price target. Don't be surprised to see that price target moved to $37.50 range.

Maxim Group initiated with a buy rating and $37 price target on December 1. They are clearly the most bullish on the stock and for good reason. I would look for the Maxim price target to expand to $40 or more given the recently posted results.

Trading Range?

The stock has a 52 week high of $34.43, but don't be too surprised to see a new level reached tomorrow. Why do I say this? Well back on October 31, 2016 some unusual call buying was spotted in ALRM. The call was a $35 strike with a March expiration. At the time, the stock was $29 and change so it was a pretty big reach. I see those same calls closing at $0.17 with open interest of 856 - so not anything to get too excited about.

What did catch my eye on the option chain was all the puts that moved the day of earnings. The 27.5 strike that expires on Friday saw 729 contracts vs open interest of 898. Check that open interest level tomorrow to see if those were all premium sellers as the put was paying $0.42.

I like the chances of several price target increases coming tomorrow. There is an outside chance we get an upgrade on the stock as well. Throw in the idea that some mildly aggressive calls were bought several months ago I and I like the chances of this stock trading over $35 on March 16 or soon thereafter. Either way, look for this stock to become a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in a day or two.

DeepMind, the London-based artificial intelligence company owned by Alphabet Inc., claims it overcame a key limitation affecting one of the most promising machine learning technologies: the software’s inability to remember.

The breakthrough, described in a paper published Tuesday in the academic journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, may open the way for artificial intelligence systems to be more easily applied to multiple tasks, instead of being narrowly trained for one purpose. It should also improve the ability of AI systems to transfer knowledge between tasks and to master a sequence of linked steps.

Neural networks, software which is loosely based on the structure of synapses in the human brain, are considered the best machine learning technique for language translation, image classification and image generation. But these networks suffer from a major flaw scientists call “catastrophic forgetting.” They exist in a kind of perpetual present: every time the network is given new data, it overwrites what it has previously learned.

In human brains, neuroscientists believe that one way in which memory works is that connections between neurons that seem important for a particular skill become less likely to be rewired. The DeepMind researchers drew on this theory, known as synaptic consolidation, to create a way to allow neural networks to remember. They worked with Claudia Clopath, a neuroscientist at London’s Imperial College, who is a co-author on the paper. “We have shown it is possible to train a neural network sequentially, which was previously thought to be a fundamental limitation,” James Kirkpatrick, a DeepMind researcher who was the lead author on the paper, said in an interview.

The researchers created an algorithm, called Elastic Weight Consolidation or EWC that computes how important each connection in a neural network is to the task it has just learned and then assigns this connection a mathematical weight proportional to its importance. The weight slows down the rate at which the value of that particular node in the neural network can be altered. In this way, the network is able to retain knowledge while learning a new task.

The researchers tested the algorithm on ten classic Atari games, which the neural network had to learn to play from scratch. DeepMind had previously created an AI agent able to play these games as well or better than any human player. But that earlier AI could only learn one game at a time. If it was later shown one of the first games it learned, it had to start all over again. The new EWC-enabled software was able to learn all ten games and, on average, come close to human-level performance on all of them. It did not, however, perform as well as a neural network trained specifically for just one game, the researchers wrote.

Peter Dayan, a professor of neuroscience at University College London, said DeepMind’s paper might benefit neuroscientists in thinking about how synaptic consolidation works. He said studies by psychologist John Pearce, at Cardiff University, seemed to indicate a very similar mechanism determined which synapses were available or unavailable for new learning.

DeepMind, which Alphabet purchased for 400 million pounds ($486.4 million) in 2014, is best known for having created AI software able to beat the world’s best players at the ancient Asian strategy game Go. That achievement was considered a major milestone in computer science because Go has so many possible moves that a computer cannot simply figure out the best move in every situation and instead must rely on something more akin to intuition – making educated guesses based on its own experience.

The commitment follows the company’s 1 million mark milestone reached today and follows the opening of Google’s Launchpad Accelerator for African startups earlier this month — tracking a growing presence by the global internet services firm on the continent.

Debuted in April 2016 with a goal of training 1 million within a year, Digital Skills for Africa offers online and face to face instruction to individuals and small businesses through 14 partners across 27 African countries. Anyone can register for free and set an individualized plan across three primary categories: business development, career advancement, or basic internet use. Users can choose from 89 courses across 23 topic areas and earn badges and certificates for successful completion.

“Across Africa…one of the things that hold people back from taking advantage of the web is a lack of understanding on how to use digital tools,” said Bunmi Banjo, Google’s Growth Engine and Brand Lead for Sub-Saharan Africa. “We are providing training to young people and business owners to succeed however, they define success for themselves?finding a job, growing a business, starting on email,” she told TechCrunch.

To meet the goal of another million trained, Google will add countries and regions to Digital Skills for Africa in 2017. It will include more offline versions of online training materials for low net access areas. Google will also offer instruction in new languages, such as Swahili, IsiZulu, and Hausa. Digital Skills for Africa will also increase its partner network for in-person instruction. Current partners include organizations like the eMobilus technical institute in Kenya and vocational training company Centrum Learning in Nigeria.

As for Google’s overall Africa presence, it now has country heads in core economy nations such as South Africa (Luke Mckend), Nigeria (Juliet Ehimuan), and Kenya (Charles Murito). The Launchpad Accelerator?which offers 6 months of equity free Google startup support with two weeks in Silicon Valley?is now accepting Africa applications.

Google provides financial and capacity support to five African tech hubs in Kenya (iHub), South Africa, Ghana, and Uganda, and Nigeria (CCHub). The company has also begun programs and partnerships to overcome Africa’s internet access and connectivity challenges. Despite progress on mobile phone ownership and ICT infrastructure over the last decade, the continent remains one of the world’s most digitally disconnected. Though some countries, such as Kenya and South Africa, have attained high usage, Africa’s internet penetration lingers at less than one- third of the continent’s estimated 1.2 billion people.

In 2016, Google entered a licensing pact with South African startup Onyx, which plans to manufacture Android smartphones on the continent. In several African countries, the company also offers its “Add to Offline” option for YouTube video playback with little to no connectivity.

Though Google could not provide overall traffic data, African search activity has increased significantly in recent years, a spokesperson confirmed. Statistics are available for popular search terms across Africa’s largest economies, providing insight on the interest palette of the continent’s growing online community.

By most accounts, the future looks bright for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Citi recently upped its price target on Apple stock in anticipation of a massive wave of upgrades from iPhone owners who have aging models, and the company's plans to double its high-margin service revenue over the course of the coming four years doesn't seem un-doable.

After all, AAPL has been beefing up its app and digital content business at a rather brisk pace for some time now.

And yet, to observers not looking at the company through rose-colored glasses, there's potential trouble ahead. Here's a closer look at three headwinds that could slow AAPL shares down more than most traders might expect.

Three Troubling Realities for Apple Stock

Last week, analysts with Citi raised their price target on Apple stock from $140 to $160 per share (maintaining the research outfit's ""Buy"" rating), thinking a wide swath of the 715 million iPhone owners out there right now are on the verge of finally upgrading their device, as 31% of those owners haven't upgraded in a couple of years .

It's not bad logic; we know the company's best new customers are its old ones.

Meanwhile, though it was little more than an afterthought just a year ago, CEO Tim Cook has put plenty of emphasis on sales of services and digital content. He's only scratched the surface, however. After generating roughly $25 billion in revenue in 2016, Apple is aiming for $50 billion in services revenue by $50 billion. That's still only a fraction of the $215 billion worth of revenue Apple mustered in 2016, but digital sales now make up the company's second-biggest segment; the iPhone is still the biggest.

Before we pop the corks on the champagne bottles though, there are three red flags everyone would be wise to process.

1. The iPhone 8 (probably) costs too much

While the launch of the iPhone 7 in the fall of last year could be considered a success in that the company sold a record-breaking 78.2 million units in the previous quarter , given the hype surrounding the device , the company should have blown away sales figures for its iPhone 6.

Some (many) suspect the demand that should have materialized for the 7 was ultimately displaced to the iPhone 8, which is supposed to be unveiled in September of this year. The word is that the admittedly impressive device is going to go for a cool $1000 each . At that price, even the most loyal of Apple fans could balk.

2. The popular smartphone is preemptively cannibalizing itself

Aside from sticker shock, would-be owners of the upcoming iPhone 8 may keep their wallet closed for the same reason many potential buyers of the iPhone 7 didn't pull the trigger - they're waiting for the phone after the next phone, which is sure to be even more amazing.

To that end, what's currently being referred to as the iPhone 9 already promises (in rumors) to be an amazing piece of hardware, complete with a folding screen . That may postpone purchases of the iPhone 8 later this year, though 2018's iPhone 9 could see softer demand because whispers of the iPhone 10 rumors will be circulating by then.

It's a vicious cycle, with Apple arguably unable to ever really log a blowout iPhone launch.

3. The Google Pixel is really, really impressive

Finally, as solid as the recent Pixel phone from Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) subsidiary Google was, it wasn't a game-changer. Analysts estimate the company only sold about 2.5 million of the device .

Bear in mind, however, this is Google's first direct foray into the smartphone world, and could be considered little more than a dry run. The Pixel 2 is slated to debut sometime this year , and it's a good bet the company has made a point of learning a lot with its first outing.

Bottom Line for AAPL Stock

Invariably, some (or several) owners of Apple stock interpret these concerns as a call that the company is doomed, and then proceed to ""colorfully disagree."" So, let me clarify something that shouldn't need saying. That is, even on AAPL stock's worst day it's still essentially unstoppable to other smartphone players. Don't read too much into the worries.

On the flipside, in that Apple stock is all too often found on investors' pedestals - lifted there by assumptions that the company is infallible - it's never a bad idea to recognize all plausible risks. These three risks could each end up stirring up surprising headwinds, and nothing takes a toll on a stock like an unexpected disappointment.

As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

Three and half years ago the company announced its plans for an audacious goal: to literally eavesdrop on the body's electrical system and enter into the body's own internal conversations in order to heal disease.

Not as crazy as it sounds

Medicine has long focused on chemical processes to alter biological function, but every organ has a nerve connection that regulates its function. Organs are controlled by patterns of electrical impulses transmitted through nerve fibers, but when organs dysfunction in chronic disease, the electrical patterns are different. That fact opens up the possibility that inserting patterns in nerves to certain organs can correct conditions that lead to disease. Using electrical impulses to influence organ function is nothing new -- cardiac pacemakers have been in use for decades -- but scientists are just beginning to realize the possibilities of using nerve signals to restore organs to normal function and actually treat disease.

Image source: GlaxoSmithKline plc.

A seminal paper was published in the scientific journal Nature in 2000 which presented evidence that stimulation of the vagus nerve could actually trigger an anti-inflammatory response in rats. Electrical stimulation of the nerve inhibited the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which is also the mechanism used by some blockbuster anti-inflammatory drugs such as AbbVie 's Humira. Since then, researchers have come to believe that influencing the the body's electrical system could lead to treatments for conditions as diverse as asthma, arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, hypertension, diabetes, infertility, and even cancer. A drug gets dispersed throughout the body, affecting multiple pathways and organs in the process and potentially causing undesired side effects, but targeting the signals of a specific nerve bundle with an implanted device has the potential for producing highly localized and specific effects.

GlaxoSmithKline announced in 2013 an effort to pour resources into the field of bioelectronics, taking a leadership role in the industry. The company announced a $1 million innovation prize, the creation and funding of a network of researchers, and the launch of a $50 million venture capital fund, Action Potential Venture Capital, to invest in pioneering bioelectronic technologies.

The investment is already producing visible progress. The first investment by the venture capital fund was in SetPoint Medical, a privately held California company that is developing a platform to treat inflammatory diseases by modulating nerve signals with implanted devices and was co-founded by one of the authors of the original 2000 paper in Nature. In July 2016 the company reported the results of a first-in-human study of vagal nerve stimulation by an implanted device for treatment of arthritis. The study showed that the approach inhibited TNF production and improved symptoms, including in some patients who had not responded to conventional drug treatments. In January 2017, SetPoint reported positive results of another human study using its device to treat Crohn's disease.

Googling the body's internal network

Image source: GlaxoSmithKline plc.

As encouraging as the results from SetPoint are, that approach is primitive compared with the ambitions of a $715 million joint venture that Glaxo and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) birthed last August called Galvani Bioelectronics. The collaboration with Verily Life Sciences, formerly known as Google Life Sciences, aims to do no less than to map the human nervous system, crack the electrical codes flowing through nerves controlling the body's organs, and be able to modify the signals to restore health using implantable devices the size of a grain of rice.

The effort has enormous potential... and enormous challenges. Verily will contribute expertise in device miniaturization and software. The tiny devices will need a read/write interface to nerve fibers and a way to be powered without heating the body -- both significant technical problems yet to be solved. The approach will also require the analysis and interpretation of massive amounts of data taken from the signals sensed on individual bundles of nerves controlling the targeted organs, something that's right up Google's alley. Glaxo, for its part, has been working for several years on a ""nerve atlas"" with the goal of identifying the specific nerve fibers whose signals will need to be decoded and modulated.

A long shot, but we could get news by 2019

Executives from GlaxoSmithKline and Verily are optimistic, though. At the time of the announcement last August, Glaxo executive Moncef Slaoui expressed the belief that Galvani could begin human trials within 18 months, achieve proof of concept in three years, and begin commercialization in seven years. This timeline puts the effort on the radar of long-term investors, who could be seeing news on developments in the next few years.

The challenge is huge, but then so is the potential payoff. ""Bioelectronic medicines have the potential of doing to the pharmaceutical industry what biopharmaceuticals did to small molecules back in the 1980s,"" says Imran Eba, partner in Action Potential Venture Capital. If that happens, GlaxoSmithKline could be in ideal position to benefit from the next big disruption in medical technology.

When it comes to investing, Warren Buffett says investors should go with index funds. But Buffett himself takes a different approach by buying individual stocks, such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ).

I n 2016, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK.B ) reported a 9.8 million-share position in AAPL stock as of March 31. That position almost doubled to 15.2 million shares as of Sept. 30, then almost quadrupled to a whopping 57.3 million shares by year's end.

So what has Buffett done with AAPL stock in 2017?

The Oracle of Omaha has more than doubled his position . The stake now stands at some 133 million shares worth about $18.1 billion. Buffett buying some 75 million shares of AAPL stock in such a short span shows confidence in Apple.

While Buffett is not known for his short-term predictions, he is heralded for his long-term investments. So, what does he like so much about Apple stock anyway? ""Apple strikes me as having quite a sticky product, and an enormously useful product to people that use it,"" Buffett told CNBC in late-February.

Perhaps the most ironic part of Buffett's discussion on Apple centered on his own device - the famed investor doesn't even own an iPhone.

Positives for AAPL Stock

Apple stock has a lot of positives. For starters, the company is flush with cash. With more than $40 per share of cash, Apple could go on a transformative M&A spree - even with the repatriation tax that, right now, it would have to pay. Add in the potential for a tax repatriation holiday from the Trump administration, and Apple's in even better shape.

Additionally, Apple is a cash cow that continues to bring in billions of dollars each quarter, which should help continue to fund dividends and stock buybacks. Plus, its cash hoard should continue to grow over time.

Despite rallying more than 40% over the past eight months, AAPL stock still trades with a below-market valuation. Sporting a price-to-earnings ratio of around 16, it's hard to consider Apple overvalued.

And the valuation argument is important. Too many investors try to justify a higher Apple stock price by applying a market-average multiple. That's an inaccurate measurement, as Apple tends to trade between a P/E range of 10 to 17 (more on that in a moment). So rarely will it trade in-line with the average S&P 500 stock.

With that said, having a low valuation is part of what makes Apple stock attractive. Shares go through pretty extreme ups and downs. But long-term investors can feel confident in buying a stock that's not egregiously priced.

Finally, investors can look forward to Apple releasing the much-anticipated iPhone 8 later this fall. With a higher potential selling price and plenty of fancy features, the new device is likely to drive record results.

Add on its quickly growing, high-margin Services business, and AAPL stock becomes even more attractive for long-term investors.



Should You Follow Buffett Into AAPL Stock?

With all these positives, Apple stock may seem like a slam-dunk.

However, I think investors would be best off waiting for a pullback. While we just highlighted its P/E ratio as a positive, it is close to the top of its five-year range. AAPL stock is cheap compared to the average stock, but getting expensive compared to its historical average.

Additionally, Apple stock has gone on a massive rally. While it's admittedly consolidating nicely just under $140, I find it hard to be a buyer at these levels.

With the overall market still up big, I can sleep more comfortably at night waiting for a pullback to buy Apple stock. If it doesn't materialize, that is something waiting investors will have to live with. I would rather miss a few points of upside in order to avoid significant points on the downside.

Historically, Apple's stock is volatile, which makes a pullback likely at some point in the next few months.

A 7% to 10% correction would be needed for me to get interested.

3/14/2017,0.580063131,0.245296717,843.64,847.24,840.8,845.62,780198,6.44,1.98,1,"Thanks to its $15.3 billion acquisition of Israeli self-driving technology company Mobileye ( MBLY ), Intel ( INTC ) is no longer on the outside looking in when it comes to the autonomous car market, which has become the new battleground for high-tech companies looking new revenue streams.

While Intel’s semiconductor prowess and breadth in R&D should accelerate the pace of Mobileye’s technology innovation, will the combined company have enough tread to catch the likes of Tesla ( TSLA ) and Google ( GOOGL )?

Intel seems to think so. The deal, which sent MBLY stock soaring 28% in active trade Monday, ""merges the intelligent eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car,” said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich in a statement. “The saying 'what's under the hood' will increasingly refer to computing, not horsepower.”

Investors weren’t immediately impressed, sending Intel shares down 2.1% to close at a three-month low of $35.16. This isn’t Intel’s first run at self-driving cars, however. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based chip giant, through its financing arm Intel Capital, has spent $250 million in R&D looking for an edge. The Mobileye deal, meanwhile, has now made it known that autonomous driving capabilities was never a hobby for Intel. It’s become a critical market for the company.

Still, Tesla and Google won’t be run off the road. In December, Google launched Waymo, which stands for “a new way forward in mobility.” Waymo’s website features a two-seater prototype fitted with Google’s hardware and software that is built to move with the touch of a button, with neither a steering wheel nor a brake pedal. Meanwhile, in Tesla’s most popular sedan, the Model S, the company has already rolled out self-driving capabilities that receive incremental updates on autopilot features.

These updates, which include “exit ramp autonomy” on highways, automatic lane-changing, and auto-steering, are also available to Model X, its SUV family. And to say nothing about Apple’s ( AAPL ) own autonomous car ambitions, which the Wall Street Journal recently confirmed. With more money stashed than the U.S. Treasury, Apple’s autonomous car position depends only on how hard it wants to mash the accelerator.

But here’s the thing: Mobileye was once a prominent partner to Tesla, meaning it could have had first-hand knowledge of what Tesla has under its hood. And to the extent Intel can utilize that knowledge to accelerate its own technology, Intel will narrow that gap relatively quickly.

At the same time, the fact that Intel wants to emerge as the go-to chip name when it comes to autonomous car processors, powering functions such as displays and communication between two self-driving vehicles, Intel doesn’t necessarily have to be the car, it can just be the brains inside the car — something it thrived on during the height of the PC era.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consumers are spending much more time on social media sites like Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) , Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) , Snap 's(NYSE: SNAP) Snapchat, and YouTube -- the subsidiary of Google, an Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) company.

But if advertisers are going to replace television ads with digital ads, they'd prefer to buy them the same way they buy those old TV commercials. Twitter is happy to oblige. The company started offering guaranteed views for pre-roll video ads, and it's also letting marketers decide what content its ads run against, according to a report from AdAge .

Back in July, former COO Adam Bain described Twitter's ability to attract television ad spend as a huge opportunity for the company. With Twitter's revenue expected to fall this year, Twitter needs to do everything it can to attract those budgets.

A bigger focus on video ads

Last month, Twitter decided to reassess its direct response, promoted tweets, and TellApart products, and focus more intently on video ads. That's where Twitter sees the potential for its highest return on investment after slashing its marketing and sales personnel by 9% last fall.

The company has been growing the amount of video on its platform by integrating Periscope, partnering with major media companies, and shifting to an algorithmic-based timeline so it can push more videos into users' feeds. In the fourth quarter, Twitter streamed more than 600 hours of live premium video from content partners, attracting 31 million unique viewers. Deals with the NFL, NBA, Bloomberg, and others has opened up a lot of high-quality video ad inventory similar to television.

By offering guarantees on marketers hitting their target audiences, Twitter should be able to attract more TV ad budgets. Television networks also offer guarantees, and use extremely popular events to make good on them if they fail to hit the mark with the original ad run. Twitter has the advantage of more advanced targeting capabilities than television, which should enable it to dynamically insert ads based on users' profiles, and more easily make good on those guarantees.

But Twitter has a lot of competition

Twitter isn't the only company competing for television ad budgets. Snap explicitly talks about the decline in television viewership among millennials, its primary demographic, as a massive opportunity for it to capitalize upon. Snapchat has several ad formats, and it's currently focusing on increasing the number of video ads it can show in users' stories, publisher's stories, and live stories.

Meanwhile, Facebook is going after the television ad market by developing more video features on both its flagship app and Instagram. Facebook now has a dedicated video section within the app, and the company is seeding it with high-quality content. It's been testing mid-roll ads to grab more ad revenue as it faces saturation of its regular newsfeed ads.

YouTube has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of shifting ad budgets, and now it's looking to prove its worth with literal TV ads. The impending launch of YouTube TV will provide a few ad slots per hour for YouTube to fill in its over-the-top streaming TV service. If YouTube can prove results better than regular television commercials, it may attract more ad spend to its main platform, as well.

Can Twitter take the pressure?

With a growing number of options for marketers to buy high-quality digital video ads, Twitter has to do what it can to stand out from the crowd. It's notably outsized by both Facebook and YouTube, and Snapchat boasts much better engagement and the demographics marketers look for.

Offering guarantees, and more say on what kind of content ads are paired with, is a good start, but those offers are easily replicated. YouTube, for example, already offers the option to buy into Google Preferred, which lets advertisers select specific packages of the most popular YouTube channels. If the guarantees make a big difference in buying trends, don't expect Twitter's victory to last long, as Google and Facebook quickly jump on board with their own guarantees.

Now I’ll dive into what I think the risks of GOOGL stock are, and how they may manifest.

Source: Shutterstock

My biggest concern with GOOGL stock has always been that it is effectively a one-trick pony. Alphabet is the largest digital advertising billboard in the world, with about 88% of its revenues coming from advertising. Moreover, GOOGL stock’s growth has been driven by this spectacular seizure of internet territory from competitors.

In fact, during the financial crisis, ad revenues still grew about 8% year-over-year in 2009 despite a worldwide ad revenue decline of 11% that year.

GOOGL Stock and Digital Advertising

Now, digital advertising was still in its hyper-growth phase back then. Should another major crisis hit, I’m not so sure that Alphabet won’t see a decline. Yet what’s so astonishing about GOOGL stock is just how much money it makes from advertising. It could get hit with a 20% decline in total revenues, which would bring it roughly in line with fiscal year 2015 results, and still generate net income of $15 billion or so, and operating cash flow of $26 billion or so.

This is hardly a catastrophe, which shows that for now at least, GOOGL has a lock on substantial growth in ad revenue. However, that advertising is the result of people using Google’s search engine. What if that changes? Right now, Google has more than 80% search engine market share. It’s so popular that we now use the product’s name as a verb.

I think it will be very difficult to supplant Google as far as search engine usage goes. However, there is other behavior which may result in less reliance on the search engine and, therefore, fewer eyeballs for ads. Mobile apps have obviously exploded in number and usage. The more adept and fully functional that apps become, the less Google may be used.

Social media is only going to grow, and the more that these products offer in terms of either their own search engines, or places for advertisers to divide their ad spend, the worse it is for GOOGL.

The apps, which were spawned by seven different developers, mostly contained carefully concealed HTML-based iframe tags that connected to two heavily obfuscated malicious domains. In one case, an app didn't use iframes but instead used Microsoft's Visual Basic language to inject an entire obfuscated Windows executable into the HTML. The apps were equipped with two capabilities. One was to load interstitial ads, and the other was to load the main app. The main apps loaded WebView components that were configured to allow loaded JavaScript code to access the app's native functionality.

That was a lot of work considering that the Windows-based malware was incapable of executing on an Android device. On top of that, the two malicious domains in the iframes—brenz.pl and chura.pl—were taken over by Polish security authorities in 2013. So what, precisely, was going on?

Researchers from Palo Alto Networks—the security firm that discovered the 132 Android apps and reported them to Google so they could be removed—believe the developers didn't intentionally include the malicious domains and executable. Instead, the researchers suspect that the developers unknowingly used the same infected programming platform to code the apps. A key reason behind the theory: the developers all shared a geographic proximity to Indonesia, and a significant number of them included the word ""Indonesia"" in their app names. In a blog post published Wednesday, the researchers wrote:

One common way HTML files have been infected with malicious IFrames has been through file infecting viruses like Ramnit. After infecting a Windows host, these viruses search the hard drive for HTML files and append IFrames to each document. If a developer was infected with one of these viruses, their app’s HTML files could be infected. However, given that the developers may all be Indonesia [sic], it’s also possible they may have downloaded an infected [integrated developer environment] from the same hosting website or they used the same infected online app generation platform. In either case, we believe the developers are not malicious and are victims in this attack. There are a few other pieces of supporting evidences from our investigation: All samples share similarities in their coding structure, suggesting that they may be generated from the same platform;

Both malicious domains used resolve to sinkholes. If developers were the attack[er]s behind all these, they could have replaced them with working domains to cause real damage;

One infected sample attempts to download windows executable file. It suggests that the attacker does not know about the target platform. Clearly, this is not the case for app developers. Potential Damages and Mitigation Currently, infected apps will not cause damage to Android users. However, this does represent a novel way for platforms to be a “carrier” for malware: not be infected themselves but spread the malware to other platforms without realizing it. Similar to the XcodeGhost attack we identified in 2015, this threat shows how attacking developers can impact end-users.

The dormant domains and the focus on Windows-based malware prevented the apps from posing a threat to the more than 10,000 people who installed the apps. But the researchers said it might have been possible for the apps to be much more malicious. Under one scenario, the iframes could have linked to active domains that used the JavaScript settings to access the apps' native functionality.

""Through this vector, all resources within the app would be available to the attackers and under their control,"" the researchers wrote. ""They could also operate silently to replace the developer's designated server with their own, and as a result, whatever information that was sent to the developer's server now falls in the hands of the attacker. Advanced attackers can also directly modify the app's internal logic, i.e., adding rooting utility, declaring additional permissions, or dropping malicious APK file, to escalate their capabilities.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you're even remotely paying attention to Wall Street, you've heard of China's e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA ). BABA stock has garnered quite a bit of media attention since making its way onto the scene in 2014 and now analysts have started to compare the firm to its American counterpart Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ).

Source: Shutterstock

Any stock that has been deemed ""the next Amazon"" deserves a second look, especially considering that AMZN has delivered returns of more than 2,000% to investors that bought into the stock 10 years ago.

However, while AMZN and Alibaba are both e-commerce giants, it's important to consider whether the similarities end there.

BABA's International Growth

Perhaps the biggest determinant of whether BABA stock can live up to its comparison with AMZN is whether Alibaba will be able to move beyond China. At the moment the Chinese e-commerce market is BABA's bread and butter and the firm has done very little to break out of that bubble.

The problem with being reliant solely on Chinese customers is that Alibaba is limited in terms of future growth potential and the firm would also suffer alongside a slide in the Chinese economy.

That's not to say that BABA hasn't already taken steps to expand its business internationally - the firm's affiliate Ant Financial recently boughtMoneygram International Inc (NASDAQ: MGI ), which could eventually develop into Alibaba's own worldwide payments business.

However, the Ant and Moneygram tie-up are still a big what-if for BABA stock. Right now, Alibaba has very little international exposure, without which the firm will never live up to AMZN.

Alibaba Stock and Cloud Computing

Much like its American counterpart, BABA is building out a cloud computing business that is worth considering. Alibaba's cloud computing arm is in the very early stages, generating just $765 million in sales. BABA's cloud efforts have eaten into the firm's profitability, with the business losing more than $90 million last year. However, all of these figures aren't necessarily a bad thing.

Alibaba was, by all accounts, a late entrant into the cloud computing space. That means that the company is having to spend significantly in order to gain market share. That explains the lack of profitability and should provide investors with some comfort about the business' inability to turn a profit. BABA's cloud computing business has also put up some pretty impressive growth metrics over the last few quarters as well - the firm gained 114,000 new customers and saw revenue growth of 115% in the December quarter.

The picture that Alibaba's financials paint of its cloud computing business looks very similar to Amazon Web Services five years ago, when it had just begun. It's important to consider the fact that BABA is starting its cloud business much later than Amazon did, but as the industry is still relatively new, that factor shouldn't hold BABA back.

There are definitely a lot of similarities between BABA and Amazon, especially if you believe in Alibaba's efforts to expand internationally and the firm's blossoming cloud computing arm. However, while they both oversee a massive e-commerce business, AMZN offers an impressive distribution and logistics network that BABA can't hold a candle to.

Also, Amazon's business model differs significantly from that of Alibaba . Amazon's business is a mix of direct sales and commission for its retail partners' sales. Alibaba, on the other hand, acts as a middleman for both small and large retailers.

The firm doesn't charge a commission, but instead sellers can pay to improve their ranking on BABA's search engine, so you could make the argument that Alibaba's business model is more similar to that of Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google.

Alibaba Stock: A Different Kind of Risk

It's also important to note that even if the two were identical businesses, the fact that BABA is based in China and conducts most of its business there is a significant difference. As fellow InvestorPlace contributor Josh Enomoto noted - cultural differences should be considered when you're comparing the two.

Gambling is much more widely accepted in Asian cultures, which could be part of the reason that the firm's share price has had such a roller-coaster ride since its IPO. Investors who are picking BABA as the next Amazon should be aware that even if the stock does deliver the same explosive growth that AMZN has, they may not see the same financial results as BABA stock has the potential to trade much more erratically.

Alibaba stock does bear a striking resemblance to Amazon, especially in AMZN's early days. However, it's not worth buying BABA stock for that reason alone, because it is likely to behave much differently than AMZN did. With that being said, Alibaba stock isn't a bad growth play when you consider its potential expansion in the payments and cloud computing space.

DISH Network (NASDAQ: DISH) was the first player in the space with the launch of its live-streaming cable alternative a little over two years ago. Sony (NYSE: SNE) began testing its own PlayStation Vue in select markets not long after that and has since taken its cable-like streaming product national. Most recently, AT&T (NYSE: T) launched DirecTV Now, giving consumers three distinct choices (not counting the not-yet-launched options from YouTube and Hulu which are still developing).

For consumers it's a lot of choices, but unlike traditional cable where every company offers roughly the same package, these three players are somewhat different. That makes determining the best one a bit of a moving target, but with three players in the space (and two more coming) it's clearly a buyer's market.

DISH Sling has the cheapest offer. Image source: DISH.

DISH has the lowest base price

For consumers looking to cut the cord in order to save money (or those who never had a cord, but are looking for the cheapest way to have some live-streaming channels) DISH's Sling TV may be the answer. The service offers 30 channels including ESPN, CNN, TNT, and a number of other cable favorites for $20 a month as part of its ""Orange"" package. For $25 a month consumers could opt for ""Blue"" which drops ESPN but adds the FOX family of channels including the broadcast network while offering 44 total choices.

On top of the base packages Sling Subscribers can choose from a number of extra add-ons in areas like news, sports, and kids programming which cost $5 or $10 each. Sling members can also add HBO, Cinemax, Starz, or one of a variety of global programming options which conveniently all work within the same player making for a very television-like experience.

PlayStation Vue is cord-free cable

Sony's PlayStation Vue has four packages starting at $29.99 a month. The entry-level offer, ""Access Slim"" comes with 45 channels, including in very-limited markets some broadcast networks. Most of the stations offered are the same ones Sling TV has, with consumers paying slightly more money for them. The ""Core Slim"" package offers 60 channels for $34.99 (perhaps the best deal) while ""Elite Slim"" comes with 90 channels for $44.99, and Ultra Slim at $64.99 which has the same 90 channels plus HBO and Showtime.

Like Sling, PlayStation Vue also offers add-on packages of Spanish-language and news programs. In addition users can buy a number of premium channels on a stand-alone basis along with HBO and Showtime. The bottom tiers for PS Vue are very similar to DISH, albeit pricier, while the higher-end tiers are essentially full-on cable packages (minus the broadcast networks in most cases) at better-than-cable pricing.

Here's what DirecTV is doing

AT&T's entree into the space looks a lot like Sony's. DirecTV Now offers very similar pricing with 60 channels costing $35, including ABC and FOX, along with some top-tier cable favorites. $50 a month gets users 80-plus channels, while $60 a month comes with over 100, and $70 takes the package to over 120 stations including Starz.

Subscribers can also add Starz separately to lower-tier deals, or add HBO or Cinemax. AT&T does not offer add-on channel packages covering specialty stations the way its rivals do. In addition DirecTV Now launches with better pricing (the $35 price for the $50 package) and it seems likely that AT&T will offer future specials likely tied to bundling other services from the company.

Which one is the best?

For consumers it's easy to test each service because all offer free trials, while also letting users come and go as they please without contracts or penalties. Sling has the best service for people looking to cut expenses while Sony and AT&T offer good deals on services that come close to mirroring actual cable. Of those two, DirecTV Now gets a slight edge because it offers ABC and FOX nationally while PlayStation Vue only offers access to broadcast networks selectively.

In addition to varying channel selections, all three services have different rules when it comes to multiple streams. Sling Orange, the cheapest service, only offers a single stream, while the $25 Blue packages allows three. DirectTV Now offers two streams to all subscribers while Sony's service allows customers to stream on five registered devices at a time giving PS Vue the advantage in this area, but it's a minor edge over Blue.

When it comes to interface all three leave something to be desired. Sony's service has a DVR (with a lot of limitations) while Sling has some on-demand programming, as does DirecTV. The biggest drawback of the streaming services is that none of them offer an experience that feels like flipping around with traditional cable. Still, once you have selected a show, the viewing experience works and feels familiar.

Sony and AT&T have decent products that save consumers some money over the average comparable cable package. But for a traditional family watching on multiple televisions, the savings may not be worth the holes in what's offered along with a viewing experience that still lags traditional cable. Sling has those same limitations, but the three streams for $25 Blue package represents the best combo of content and value, giving it a small victory in an emerging space.

Mobileye's stock is up 29.43% in early afternoon trading on Monday to $61.19 per share, near its all-time high. Intel's stock dropped 2.31% to $35.08 per share.

Mobileye specializes in chip-based camera systems called ""artificial vision sensors."" The technology alerts drivers in real-time to potential road hazards, like pedestrians. The company claims that the sensor technology is 99% accurate and helps prevent accidents. It is working towards putting this technology into self-driving car technology in the future. Mobileye currently helps support over 15 million vehicles.

Israel-based Mobileye was founded in 1999 and it went public in July 2014. The IPO came after Mobileye began to invest in driverless car technology. The company's current market cap is nearly $10.5 billion. In a memo to employees , Mobileye executives said Intel's existing automated-driving efforts will be integrated into the company, and existing Israel leaders will head up the efforts.

Intel's $15.3 billion acquisition is the biggest ever for an Israeli technology company. The move positions Intel as a ""leading technology provider in the fast-growing market for highly and fully autonomous vehicles,"" according to a company statement Monday. ""Intel estimates the vehicle systems, data and services market opportunity to be up to $70 billion by 2030.""

Mobileye previously worked with Tesla, Inc. TSLA to help power the electric carmaker's Autopilot technology. The two companies parted ways after a Tesla driver died in a car crash on May 7, 2016, while using its Autopilot feature.

The deal comes after Mobileye partnered with self-driving technology company Delphi Automotive in Aug. 2016. The two companies plannedto create an affordable self-driving car platform to sell to carmakers by 2019. In Nov. 2016, Intel announced that Mobileye and Delphi would use its processors.Intel, Mobileye and German automaker BMW AG partnered to test 40 self-driving cars, which could possibly lead to production by 2021.

Intel's purchase helps the technology giant begin to compete in the race towards autonomous car technology .

Last year, in the self-driving race, General Motors GM spent $1 billion to purchase Cruise Automation. Uber recently bought self-driving truck maker Otto for $680 million. QUALCOMM Incorporated QCOM , an Intel competitor, recently bought NXP Semiconductors N.V. NXPI , a leading semiconductor supplier to the automotive industry.

In Nov. 2016, Samsung Electronics Co. bought Harman International Industries Inc. for $8 billion to move into the automotive vehicle space.

Waymo, the self-driving car company that split off from Google's parent company Alphabet Inc. GOOG , asked a federal court recently to stop Uber Technologies Inc.'s from developing autonomous vehicles. Waymo claims that Uber stole proprietary design secrets. The lawsuit states that a former manager of Google's self-driving car project took documents before quitting to start the self-driving truck company Otto, which Uber acquired quickly.

Intel bought security-software company McAfee Inc. for $7.7 billion in 2011. The company sold McAfee for a major loss in 2016.

After missing out on the rise of the smartphone, Intel has fought to try and stay ahead of the next big technology. Intel is betting big on driverless car technology. The company purchased Israel-based 3D video technology company Replay Technologies in March 2016.

Intel announced in April 2016 it would lay off 11% of its workforce to in order to cut costs and to free up capital to invest in new businesses. In January, Intel announced it would purchase a 15% stake in digital mapmaker Here International B.V., joining BMW AG and Volkswagen AG's VLKAY Audi, to further the development in the real-time technology needed to improve self-driving car technology.

Auto part suppliers are doing well today in the wake of the Intel and Mobileye deal. Lear Corporation's LEA stock is 1.30% to $46.36+ per share Monday, an all-time high. Delphi's DLPH stock is up 3.37% to $79.69 per share. Visteon Corporation's VC stock is up 5.58% to $98.77 per share.

Shareholders are the ultimate owners of any publicly traded business.

By putting capital on the line to gain fractional ownership of a company, shareholders will participate in the successes (and failures) of the underlying business.

Company management teams have some very obvious goals that are dictated by shareholders, including:

Maximize profits

Minimize expenses

Reduce reputational risk

Make ethical and socially responsible decisions

There are also certain behaviors that are considered to be shareholder-friendly, which typically include dividend payments and share repurchases.

This article will discuss six signs of a shareholder-friendly stock in detail.

Reasonable levels of executive compensation

Executive compensation is a hot topic on both Main Street and Wall Street.

The CEOs of large corporations are almost always the highest-paid employees, and total compensation can reach the $20 million-plus range.

Further, CEO compensation has been growing more quickly than the rest of the 0.1% and the stock market (as measured by the S&P 500).

Source: Economic Policy Institute

There are two measures by which the shareholder-friendliness of a company's executive compensation program can be checked.

First, the total compensation package of a business' upper-level management should be in the same range as its peers.

Information about executive compensation is disclosed in a filing called the Definitive 14A proxy statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

You can find company filings with the SEC by searching this database. For information on executive compensation, search for ""DEF 14A"" filings, which will return the company's ""Other definitive proxy statements.""

For an example, you can see Johnson & Johnson 's ( JNJ ) CEO compensation package below.

Source: Johnson & Johnson Proxy Circular

Another important consideration is whether executive compensation is dependent on the performance of the business they lead.

In most cases, this is certainly the case. CEO compensation is usually dependent on the company meeting certain financial performance targets.

These targets are outlined in the same DEF 14A filings with the SEC. Johnson & Johnson's criteria for its executive compensation package can be seen below.

Source: Johnson & Johnson Proxy Circular

For investors looking to own shareholder-friendly companies, finding businesses whose executive compensation practices are reasonable and dependent on company performance is a great place to start.

High levels of insider ownership

Insider ownership is when company insiders (executives, board members, etc.) own company stock.

When insider ownership levels are high, it means the company's management has a lot of faith in the business' investment prospects.

Since management knows more about the business than any investor, shareholders can rest assured the most informed individuals are confident in the company's future.

The requirement of insider ownership is also seen as shareholder-friendly corporate governance.

Details about executive stock ownership requirements can also be found in the company's 14A proxy statements.

For instance, Johnson & Johnson's executive stock ownership requirements can be seen below.

Source: Johnson & Johnson Proxy Statement, page 44

Notice the stock ownership guidelines are expressed as a multiple of base salary. This is typical among companies that require executives to be shareholders.

A textbook example of high insider ownership is Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B).

Berkshire is a large conglomerate with holdings in many industries (including insurance, manufacturing and railways) that also has a large portfolio of common stock investments.

You can see an analysis of Berkshire Hathaway's top 20 high-yield dividend stocks here.

In Berkshire Hathaway's 2016 definitive proxy statement, the company reported Buffett owned 38.2% of Berkshire Hathaway's Class A stock. This high level of insider ownership is almost unheard of in a company as large as Berkshire.

Insider ownership (and the requirement of insider ownership) is a sign of a shareholder-friendly stock.

Clear communication with shareholders

Through shareholder presentations and press releases, a company's management team has plenty of opportunities to communicate with shareholders.

Companies who make the most of these communication opportunities should be appreciated by their investors. There are two benefits to investing in companies that readily communicate with shareholders:

Gain a greater understanding of the underlying business.

Gain a greater understanding of the business' prospects.

For the first point, there is no better example than Buffett (again).

His shareholder letters often elaborate on Berkshire's businesses in much more detail than is required by regulators.

This helps investors understand the intricacies of the $433 billion conglomerate.

A great example of a company whose management is clear about the business' prospects is 3M ( MMM ). The company is very clear about its long-term goals for business growth:

Source: 3M Investor Presentation, slide 14

The Coca-Cola Co. (KO) is another business that is similarly candid about business prospects.

In the company's presentation at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York (CAGNY) conference, it provided the following slide on its 2016 outlook.

Source: Coca-Cola 2016 CAGNY Presentation, slide 47

As with most things, financial forecasting is best digested in moderation. Even the wisest management teams cannot fully predict the future.

Business forecasts that go beyond the realm of reasonable prediction should be considered a red flag by investors.

Buffett has warned against excessive forecasting in the past, writing the following in a letter to shareholders:

"" Finally, be suspicious of companies that trumpet earnings projections and growth expectations. Businesses seldom operate in a tranquil, no-surprise environment, and earnings simply don't advance smoothly (except, of course, in the offering books of investment bankers). ""

Source: Berkshire Hathaway 2002 Annual Report, page 2

With that in mind, management teams that work to help investors understand their business and its growth prospects (within reason) are a sign of a shareholder-friendly company.

Acceptable use of adjusted financial metrics

When companies report earnings, they have the option to report adjusted earnings per share, which generally backs out one-time expenses such as:

Restructuring charges

Severance packages

One-time tax liabilities

And other metrics that are perceived to impede comparability to previous fiscal years.

Including adjusted earnings in shareholder reports is completely optional. The proportion of companies that include adjusted financial metrics has been rising over time however.

Source: Business Insider

Buffett commented on this trend in Berkshire Hathaway's 2016 Annual Report:

"" Too many managements - and the number seems to grow every year - are looking for any means to report, and indeed feature, 'adjusted earnings' that are higher than their company's GAAP earnings. There are many ways for practitioners to perform this legerdemain. Two of their favorites are the omission of 'restructuring costs' and 'stock-based compensation' as expenses. ""

Source: Berkshire Hathaway 2016 Annual Report, page 16

Buffett later elaborates on each of these, saying about restructuring costs:

"" Berkshire, I would say, has been restructuring from the first day we took over in 1965. [...]We have never, however, singled out restructuring charges and told you to ignore them in estimating our normal earning power. If there were to be some truly major expenses in a single year, I would, of course, mention it in my commentary.""

Source: Berkshire Hathaway 2016 Annual Report, page 16

And later, on the exclusion of stock-based compensation in the calculation of adjusted earnings:

"" If CEOs want to leave out stock-based compensation in reporting earnings, they should be required to affirm to their owners one of two propositions: why items of value used to pay employees are not a cost or why a payroll cost should be excluded when calculating earnings. ""

Source: Berkshire Hathaway 2016 Annual Report, page 16

It is perfectly acceptable for a company to report adjusted earnings under one condition - shareholders read and understand the reconciliation between adjusted earnings and GAAP earnings.

These reconciliations can be found in quarterly earnings presentations. For example, the Walt Disney Co. ( DIS ) included the following reconciliation in its first-quarter earnings release:

Source: The Walt Disney Company Investor Document

Disney's reconciliation is simple and easy to understand - which makes its use of adjusted earnings helpful and acceptable.

Another alternative method of presenting a company's perceived earnings power is through EBITDA, which stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.

Buffett, among others, has been vocally critical of this metric in the past since the implication is that the four excluded costs (interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) are not true expenses.

"" Every dime of depreciation expense we report is a real cost. That's true, moreover, at most other companies. When CEOs tout EBITDA as a valuation guide, wire them up for a polygraph test. ""

Source: Berkshire Hathaway 2014 Annual Report, page 15

Buffett's criticism of EBITDA has been long-standing. He also commented on the use of EBITDA in his 2002 shareholder letter, and probably earlier.

"" Trumpeting EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) is a particularly pernicious practice. Doing so implies that depreciation is not truly an expense, given that it is a 'non-cash' charge. That's nonsense. In truth, depreciation is a particularly unattractive expense because the cash outlay it represents is paid up front, before the asset acquired has delivered any benefits to the business. ""

Source: Berkshire Hathaway 2002 Annual Report, page 21

Overall, investors should only accept the use of adjusted financial metrics if they can understand the reconciliation between the GAAP and non-GAAP metrics.

Share repurchases

Share repurchases involve a company buying its own stock on the open market with the intent of reducing the number of shares outstanding.

This is beneficial because the company's financial results are divided among less shares.

Share repurchases can have a pretty remarkable effect on bottom line growth and shareholder returns. The table below shows the amazing compounding power of a business that:

Grows earnings at 8% a year

Trades at a constant price-earnings ratio of 15

Uses 75% of earnings on share repurchases

Note this is a very simplified example because earnings growth, valuation multiples and share repurchases will all tend to fluctuate over time.

More importantly, note most of the total return was due to the share repurchases. The company's stock price grew by more than a factor of 10, while earnings grew by a factor of approximately 4.6.

Without the buybacks, the company's return over the 20-year period would be less than half as large.

Share repurchases create value only when the stock is trading at less than its perceived intrinsic value.

If company management repurchases shares at a high valuation, they are effectively ""buying three quarters for the price of a dollar.""

This has the same value-destroying capabilities as when investors buy overpriced stocks on the open market.

Buffett commented on this in his 2016 Annual Report:

"" For continuing shareholders, however, repurchases only make sense if the shares are bought at a price below intrinsic value. When that rule is followed, the remaining shares experience an immediate gain in intrinsic value. Consider a simple analogy: If there are three equal partners in a business worth $3,000 and one is bought out by the partnership for $900, each of the remaining partners realizes an immediate gain of $50. If the exiting partner is paid $1,100, however, the continuing partners each suffer a loss of $50. The same math applies with corporations and their shareholders. Ergo, the question of whether a repurchase action is value-enhancing or value-destroying for continuing shareholders is entirely purchase-price dependent.""

Source: Berkshire Hathaway 2016 Annual Report, page 7

A good example of a company repurchasing undervalued shares recently is Apple ( AAPL ).

Because of its incredibly popular products like the iPhone, Mac and iPad, Apple has a massive cash hoard that has been effectively deployed to repurchase shares.

In the company's first-quarter earnings release, Apple reported $10.9 billion spent on repurchases of common stock, which is more than three times the $3.1 billion spent on dividend payments.

Source: Apple First Quarter 8-K , page 6

These buybacks have followed Buffett's rule of only repurchasing undervalued shares.

Apple has traded at a notably lower price-earnings ratio than its peers (large-cap technology companies) over the past few years, and this trend continues today:

Apple: 16.7

Alphabet ( GOOG ) (GOOGL): 30.2

( GOOG ) (GOOGL): 30.2 Microsoft (MSFT): 30.6

(MSFT): 30.6 Facebook (FB): 39.6

The valuation multiples listed above are based on trailing 12-month GAAP EPS.

When assessing a company's investment prospects, the two main buyback-related considerations are whether it is engaged in a buyback program currently and whether the management states a particular price or valuation at which they would be happy to repurchase stock.

Dividend payments

Dividend payments are an important part of shareholder returns.

Dividends are the only way for an investor to profit from investing in a company without reducing or eliminating their ownership stake.

Dividends also have a high degree of correlation with shareholder returns. In a previous analysis, I examined the long-term (2000 to 2015) correlations of a variety of financial metrics and total returns.

You can see the results of that analysis below.

Source: Publicly Available Financial Statements

Dividend payments demonstrated higher correlation with total returns than any other financial metric - even earnings per share.

The outperformance of companies that consistently raise their dividends can be seen when looking at the Dividend Aristocrats Index, which is comprised of companies with at least 25 years of consecutive dividend payments.

You can see the list of all 51 Dividend Aristocrats here.

The performance of the Dividend Aristocrats is compared to the S&P 500 Index below.

Source: Dividend Aristocrats Fact Sheet

Over the past 10 years, the Dividend Aristocrats have returned 10.14% per year while the S&P 500 has returned 7.62% per year - an outperformance of 2.52%.

When searching for shareholder-friendly stocks, dividend payments are one of the most important (and most straightforward) signs to look for.

Final thoughts

Shareholder-friendly companies will make better investments than those that are not, all else being equal.

Fortunately, there are many telltale signs of a shareholder-friendly stock:

Reasonable levels of executive compensation High levels of insider ownership Clear communication with shareholders Acceptable use of adjusted financial metrics Share repurchases Dividend dayments

Incorporating these signs into your investment process can help identify companies with management teams that have shareholders' best interests in mind.

(RTTNews.com) - The California State proposed new regulations for the testing and deployment of fully autonomous vehicles, dropping an earlier requirement that a human driver had to be present while testing on public roads.

The state's Department of Motor Vehicles or DMV also backed down on a previous rule that required a steering wheel and pedals in the vehicles for the operator to take back control.

The latest regulations are expected to finally prepare self driving cars move from testing to commercialization. The state's DMV had published draft regulations in late 2015 that required human drivers, a steering wheel and pedals.

California DMV Chief Counsel Brian Soublet during a conference call said, ""When we think of driverless vehicles they can either have conventional controls, which are steering wheels, pedals, things like that, or they cannot.""

For companies testing vehicles without conventional controls, the approval from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has to be shown to the California DMV, Soublet said. In early 2016, NHTSA reportedly said that self-driving software systems can also be considered drivers.

California-based Alphabet Inc. is developing self-driving software and vehicles through its Waymo division. Responding to the previous draft regulations, the company had said that it was gravely disappointed. Google has been developing prototypes with no steering wheel or pedals.

The proposed regulations have a 45-day public comment period that ends on April 24, which will be followed by a public hearing. The California DMV expects the rules to be completed by the end of the year.

(RTTNews.com) - A couple of jet skiers on a spring break were saved by Port Canaveral harbor pilot and a Brevard County Sheriff Marine Unit deputy from a near tragic accident.

According to the Port Canaveral Harbor Pilot Association, Captain Doug Brown, one of its harbor pilot, was navigating Carnival Cruise ship Magic out of the port when he noticed two women on a jet ski within the navigation channel. He alerted the sheriff's deputy Taner Primmer who was operating a patrol boat nearby for help.

As Primmer reached the scene one of the boaters fell off the water craft and when an attempt was made to re-board, the water craft flipped and both boaters ended up in the water in extremely close proximity to the bow of the ship now bearing down on their position. Brown, working with the Captain and bridge team of the Carnival Magic, maneuvered the vessel away from the boaters while Deputy Primmer pulled both boaters aboard his patrol vessel and out of harm's way.

It’s always been known that devices running Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Android operating system are much more susceptible to being infected than Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhones. However, the situation may be even worse than we realized.

Source: Check Point Software Technologies

A mobile security research team posted on Friday that it scanned devices owned by two large companies and found Android malware pre-installed on smartphones from 38 different manufacturers.

That discovery should concern both corporate IT departments, and consumers. And it once again validates Apple’s “controlling” iPhone approach.

Android Malware Illustrates the Downside of Google’s Approach

From the launch of the first iPhone in 2007, Apple retained full control of its iOS operating system and installed it only on its own hardware. Apps can only be downloaded from the App Store and these are checked and vetted by Apple engineers.

With limited hardware configurations, Apple is able to test iOS thoroughly for all iPhone users. The company is aggressive about pushing out new iOS versions (79% of all iPhones are running iOS 10), and in the event of a security issue, it’s able to quickly push out system updates to address it.

With Android, GOOGL took a very different approach from Apple. It went wide open, licensing Android to dozens of different smartphone manufacturers. Users are free to tinker with the operating system and they can download apps from virtually anywhere — not just Google Play. This open approach helped Google to dominate the smartphone industry, with nine out of 10 new smartphones running Android.

But the approach makes smartphone security a nightmare.

Android updates often require manufacturer and/or carrier cooperation. As a result, only 2% of Android devices are running the latest version of Android, while the majority are running software that’s at least several years out of date.

Freedom to install questionable apps plus an older version of the operating system has let Android malware run rampant. At one point it was estimated to account for 97% of all mobile malware.

Check Point’s Pre-Installed Android Malware Discovery

Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ: CHKP ), an IT security company, reported in a Friday blog post that it had scanned the smartphones for two large companies (identified only as “large telecommunications company” and a “multinational technology company”) and discovered Android malware had been pre-installed on smartphones from 38 different hardware manufacturers.

Android malware identified ranged from adware to mobile ransomware capable of encrypting all data on the device until a fee is paid to unlock it. Some had been added to the smartphone ROM, meaning reinstalling Android would not remove it. And none of this malware was downloaded by users. The smartphones arrived at the two companies pre-infected, with installation happening “somewhere along the supply chain.”

(RTTNews.com) - Alphabet's self-driving project Waymo is seeking an injunction to block Uber from using self-driving operations.

The motion for the injunction comes a few weeks after Waymo filed a lawsuit against Uber and the head of its self-driving division Anthony Levandowski accusing of theft of a key technology system.

Levandowski had joined Uber when the ride-hailing service acquired his startup, Otto, last year.

According to Verge, Gary Brown, a forensic security engineer with Google, said that Levandowski downloaded those files using his personal laptop, which made it easy to track.

""When an employee's device interacts with a Google service or is active on a Google network, those interactions and activities can be recorded in logs that identify the device (by its unique identifiers) and/or the interaction or activity (for example, downloading files from a secure repository),"" Brown said.

The past couple of weeks have been … well, interesting ones for Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD ) shareholders. AMD stock, after more than quintupling over the course of the prior 12 months, fell 16% in just four days a week ago and has struggled to pick itself up off the mat in the meantime.

The prod for the pullback? Reports that its new (and well-hyped) computer processor wasn't performing quite as well as expected once put to the test in real-world applications. As Ars Technica reviewer Mark Walton put it :

""The [Ryzen] 1800X lags behind its Intel counterparts in gaming, regardless of whether it's running at the same clock speed or higher.""

It was a real blow to optimistic investors, who had bid AMD stock up in a big way on hopes that the new CPU would be the centerpiece of a turnaround story. Now that story is in question.

Thing is, the Ryzen may not be as central to the company's rebound as it's been made it to be. Indeed, Advanced Micro Devices has a lot more going for it besides the new CPU that investors aren't giving it credit for. Three specific items come to mind. Note than a handful of AMD's competitors are now becoming partners.

3 Things AMD Still Has Going For It

While investors had high expectations for Ryzen, the future for Advanced Micro Devices isn't dependent on it. In fact, there are three other areas that may end up meaning even more for its top and bottom lines.

In no particular order …

Penetrating the Cloud Market: While AMD has always had a presence in most key tech markets, cloud computing was never a key one for the company. That's changing now though… a ball that got rolling just in the past few weeks. In November, Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google division tapped AMD, looking to add its graphical processor units to Google's machine learning architecture .

It's a curious development, as GPU chips weren't designed to do anything more than handle a computer's display screen. As it turns out, though, its GPUs are very capable of parallel computing, which is a critical aspect of this new cloud-based function.

In the meantime, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) selected AMD processors to power its next-generation open course cloud platform.

At stake is a piece of the cloud infrastructure market worth an estimated $300 billion per year.

More Licensing Revenue: It's only an unconfirmed rumor thus far, but a reasonably credible one. That is, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC ) is reportedly interested in using AMDs Radeon graphics technology to power Intel's integrated GPUs in future computers … displacing Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ). The agreement between Nvidia and Intel ends at the end of March.

At the very least, the prospect of such an IP licensing deal could mean a couple hundred million dollars in annual high-margin revenue. If Intel really wants to step up its game, though, it could help fund improvements in the way its CPUs handle graphics.

New GPUs Will Enhance New CPU Revenue: While the reviews for the new Ryzen processor have been mixed, AMD stock holders should bear in mind that they're only half the next generation of hardware for Advanced Micro Devices.

The other half of the one-two punch combination for AMD this year is the new Vega GPU, which should be unveiled around the middle of this year. As was noted back on Feb. 7 :

""Vega, is a second-generation high bandwidth memory (or HBM2) design found on a stacked-memory architecture that performs significantly better than the more common GDDR5 (double data rate type-five) utilized by most graphics processing units today. An essentially-infinite amount of memory can be dedicated to handling the display - the maximum virtualization is capped at a ridiculous 512 terabytes. This platform is about twice as powerful as most current alternatives, and will make Advanced Micro Devices competitive with the newest generation of GPU architecture from Nvidia, called Pascal.""

More important, Vega was largely built with the Ryzen processor in mend, with each getting the most performance out of one another.

In the meantime, it's not like the Ryzen CPU is a lost cause. As the company's CEO Lisa Su recently explained , ""We hear people on wanting to see improved 1080p performance and we fully expect that Ryzen performance in 1080p will only get better as developers get more time with 'Zen.' We have over 300+ developers now working with 'Zen' and several of the developers for Ashes of Singularity and Total [War:] Warhammer are actively optimizing now.""

Bottom Line for AMD Stock

As encouraging as the future may be for the company whether or not Ryzen ends up performing well, there's still no denying that AMD stock is overbought and ripe for some profit-taking; that 16% dip is nothing compared to 2016's huge rally.

But don't confuse any future weakness from AMD as evidence of what's in store, results-wise, from the company. Advanced Micro Devices is very well positioned for a great 2017. The trick is just being patient enough to wait for a truly palatable entry price. That could still be well below the recent low.

In other words, you don't want to step into AMD stock for the long haul until it's almost uncomfortable to do so. We aren't there yet.

As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

This podcast was recorded on March 3, 2017.

Dylan Lewis: The next piece of news we're going to talk about is even more bizarre. According to reports from The New York Times , the company had other hardware ambitions, namely drones. At the moment, details are scarce, but several anonymous sources at the company confirmed Snap has been pursuing a drone camera project. I guess the thought here is, drones would allow aerial Snaps, it would allow people to capture video and images in a more novel way and a cool landscape way. Again, this seems kind of crazy to me, for this to be the focus.

Evan Niu: [laughs] Yeah. It makes no sense to me. As ridiculous as the Spectacle thing is, trying to brand a company around those, the drone thing also makes no sense to me. It's hard to imagine someone buying a drone. First of all, it's hard to imagine Snap coming out with a drone that is competitive with what's already out there from DJI and even GoPro . Look at even GoPro trying to get into drones -- they've had a lot of trouble. A company like GoPro that had experience making cameras still has trouble making a really compelling drone that has all the full features that people expect nowadays.

Lewis: They famously had to recall one of their products, because they were having trouble with it.

Niu: Yeah, because the battery was loose. If you shook it, the battery would move by a millimeter and the contacts would lose power, which is a really simple and kind of embarrassing problem. It was such a silly little mistake, and it probably had something to do with their manufacturing or something, I don't know. But yeah, the point being, GoPro hasn't really pulled off the drone thing very well either. And they were probably much better-positioned to make that kind of jump in the first place. And, of course, this is just a report that they're working on. Who knows if they actually do it. I hope they realize that it's a bad idea, and probably save everyone a bunch of headaches if they just don't do it at all. I mean, I guess it's not surprising that they have looked into it, since they want to become a camera company. But whether or not they actually do it, I think the chances are probably against it. I would hope so.

Lewis: Yeah. I get that, it's tempting to be a tech company and have these really sexy side project. You see the stuff that Alphabet has done with Google's self-driving cars. That is so far afield from their core search property. Even getting into virtual reality on the hardware side with Oculus. But, you look at those two companies, those are businesses that have a cash cow underlying all of these futuristic R&D projects. Their core platforms, their ad-selling platforms are doing wonders for them, and are allowing them to throw money off on the side, and see what happens with these more futuristic, hard-to-pin-down-what-the-impact-might-be type projects. I think with Snap right now, there's a little bit of a focus concern on my end, because you haven't really figured out your core platform yet, you haven't monetized it really well. You're still rolling ads into it and building it into the user experience. And, you have like 3% quarter-to-quarter user growth. You have so many issues with what should be your core focus, I'm not really sure why they're doubling down on their hardware initiatives, if this is something they're really spending a lot of time on.

Niu: That's a good point, I agree completely. Why aren't they focusing on getting the core business up and running in a good way? They're just now really rolling out these ads. Of course, in advertising, your ability to target ads is really critical in delivering value to your advertisers, who are the actual customers. That's who pays you. Facebook does a really good job with ad targeting because they have so much of your data. Twitter , I think, has had some troubles, which is partially why they're not monetizing as well as they should be. So, I guess the question is, how much user data can Snap really get, and how valuable will that be? Most of the stuff you're putting on Snapchat disappears immediately. What kind of data can they gather that's going to be really useful to turn around and use for targeting? It's kind of the same thing with Twitter. A lot of times, people can view tweets publicly without having to sign in, which limits Twitter's ability to gather data on them, which is also why it's harder for them to monetize their users. It's a big question on execution going forward, how they can really grow this ad business. If they can, this will do well. They are very new to this.

Lewis: Yeah, it's something that I think they really have to figure out still. You look at the data points that Facebook and Google have on their users, and you're right, it's totally different, the profile is so robust for what people have on their Facebook. They know all my interests, they know everything I like, and they're able to incorporate that into the algorithms they're using to feed stuff up to me. Google knows exactly what you're searching for, and can serve up hyper-relevant stuff. With Snap, they know your friends, they know your demographic, and maybe they know some of the outlets that you're typically interested in on the story side. But I think they still need to do a ton to figure that out, and I'd rather see them doubling down there than going further afield with some of these hardware projects.

Niu: Yeah. The big emphasis on hardware in general is confounding to me. I don't understand why they're doing it, or why they're trying to make this pivot -- if you want to call it a pivot. They should just get down to working on their actual ad platform, focus on the software-as-a-service stuff, before they really start dabbling in this hardware stuff. Hardware is hard.

Lewis: And the way that their hardware is set up, too, their Spectacles are built-in to integrate with Snapchat. They're not really a device that you can use across platforms.

Niu: Well, you can export, and it exports in a circular format as opposed to the square format that most people see. So, there is a way that you can export content that you take on Spectacles. But, yeah, the point is, you would think they would want to tie exclusively to the platform. But then, it's like, why would you buy some product that's only available for this platform? Conversely, if it's not a good product, if it works on all platforms, why would you buy it unless it's the best product out there? It's this really weird Catch 22. Imagine, would you buy a product that could only submit stuff to Facebook? It doesn't make any sense. But that would be the differentiating factor. But yeah, their whole strategy makes no sense to me.

Lewis: Yeah, it seems a little backwards. The point that I was going to make is just, the biggest salesman for the hardware stuff is going to be people being on the platform in general. The addressable market for those products is going to be whatever the user base that they have is. Right now, it's around 160 million daily active users. The most compelling way to make that hardware business look appetizing is to continue to grow that user base, then maybe you have people that want something that's a little bit more dedicated. I'm still skeptical of that. But ultimately, that logic ties back to, build the platform out and grow the user base, and worry about hardware second, right?

Niu: Yeah, I agree.

(NASDAQ: AMZN ) — the dominant name in the category — is not alone anymore.

At the company’s Google Cloud Next conference keynote, Alphabet chairman Eric Schmidt declared, “We’re here for real.” He added, “[Google] has the money, the means and the commitment to pull off a new platform of computation globally, for everybody who needs it.”

The Mountain View-based company calls Google Cloud, which is third behind No. 2 cloud player, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ), its next growth engine. Google CEO Sundar Pichai deemed the platform as an “extraordinarily big bet.”

To that end, Alphabet, which on Thursday unveiled an enterprise version of its Google Hangouts messaging platform called “Hangouts Chat,” must find ways to convince current and would-be enterprise clients that Google Cloud is the platform they belong on.

GOOGL Stock

Despite the strong revenue Alphabet generates, Google’s cloud revenue, which is estimated to have a run rate of only $1 billion, according to Recode. The company ended fiscal 2016 with revenue of $90.27 billion.

By contrast, market leader Amazon’s Web Services last year surpassed an annual run rate of $12 billion. Notably, Google Cloud’s $1 billion run rate is still about one-third of Microsoft’s $2.7 billion. But all of this means that Google still has tons of room for growth. Over the past year, the company has landed cloud clients such as Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS ), The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE: HD ) and even rival Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ).

Why are these industry titans important to Google?

According to IDC, worldwide spending on public cloud services is expected to soar to more than $195 billion by 2020, more than doubling the revenue of 2016. “Cloud software will significantly outpace traditional software product delivery over the next five years, growing nearly three times faster than the software market as a whole and becoming the significant growth driver to all functional software markets,” said Benjamin McGrath, senior research analyst, SaaS and Business Models.

Meanwhile, Pacific Crest analyst Brent Bracelin forecasts public cloud spending, currently around $58 billion annually, will triple to $205 billion in the next three years. As Google’s cloud business grows, GOOGL stock will too.

Bottom Line for Alphabet

GOOGL stock closed Thursday at $857.84, up 0.49%. The shares have risen 8.7% year to date, while climbing 17.6% over the past year. These aren’t breathtaking returns when compared to the almost 50% one-year gains Amazon stock has delivered, but Alphabet looks poised to make up ground if the company can realize its cloud ambitions.

The search giant is splitting its video and chatting service into two separate products to better appeal to business customers. As of Thursday, Hangouts Meet will be focused on corporate video conferencing while Hangouts Chat will target workplace chat and business productivity.

The revamped Hangouts apps are part of Google’s G Suite portfolio of workplace software that includes the Gmail and Calendar apps, said Google’s director of product management Scott Johnston. Unlike the free version of Hangouts used by consumers, businesses will have to pay for the new services as part of a package deal for G Suite, like they do for the current enterprise-version of Hangouts. Johnston said Google's existing Hangouts enterprise customers will not be charged extra for the new Hangouts apps.

Google's revamp of Hangouts is part of a broader push into enterprise technology and away from its roots as a consumer-oriented search and advertising business. Since hiring Diane Greene, the former CEO and founder of enterprise software company VMware ( vmw ) , as head of its cloud business unit, Google is heavily marketing itself as a sort of one-stop-shop for business technology.

Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.

In addition to selling basic computing infrastructure in what’s known as cloud computing, Google ( goog ) is also selling database software, developer tools, and workplace productivity apps.

“We are fighting this perception that we are search,” said Scott Johnston, Google’s director of product management, while citing progress in enterprise software. “It feels like it is less of an uphill battle now.”

But the company still faces many challenges.

For one, numerous rivals are also investing heavily in areas that Google wants to dominate. The biggest cloud-computing vendor Amazon ( amzn ) , for example, just recently debuted its own Chime video conferencing service and will reportedly introduce more workplace software soon. Microsoft ( msft ) , on the other hand, operates its popular Skype video conferencing service, and its long-awaited Teams chat app will be released next week.

Cisco ( csco ) , Atlassian ( team ) , and Slack also sell similar tools.

Google is pitching its new conferencing app as faster to set up meetings than competing web conferencing services like Cisco’s WebEx. The new Hangouts Meet app, which Google accidentally pushed live to its online store before the app's debut, also comes with the ability to record meetings, has various features intended to satisfy company legal teams like the ability to retain conferencing data, and can handle up to 30 people at once.

Hangouts Chat, which will be available to the general public at an undisclosed date, is similar to other competing chat services like Slack, which lets employees initiate conversations with others based on topics. However, both Hangouts Chat and Meet were built on top of several homegrown Google services like the Spanner database that Johnston claims make the services less likely to crash.

The apps are also connected to Google’s machine-learning tools that make it possible for so-called software bots to automatically perform various tasks. These tasks include scheduling meetings based on when people's respective calendars show they're available.

Still, the fact that Google is essentially splitting its popular Hangouts app into two services has the potential to confuse people who are used to seeing both chat and video conferencing features glued together.

Although Google wants to popularize its Hangouts apps to business clientele, many consumers still use Hangouts in its current state to call family and chat with friends. Google is trying to convince consumers to switch from Hangouts to its Duo video-calling app and Allo messaging app, but its unclear how many people currently use those new services. Eventually, consumers will be ""upgraded to Hangouts Meet and Chat,"" but those versions won't contain the data retention services, conferencing features, or other bushiness-oriented features like the paid versions, Johnston said.

It’s also unclear how many users will upgrade from the free version of Hangouts to the new paid services. Johnston is optimistic, saying “the freemium model works,” the idea of luring customers with free services that they can upgrade by paying, but Google does not disclose how many people do so.

Google also has a history of killing off products after a while like Google Reader for receiving news feeds, Google Search Appliance, and Google Site Search, for companies to use Google search for internal documents. Additionally, Google said recently that it would stop supporting its Spaces messaging app that it debuted in May.

For more about technology and finance, watch :

Johnston, who did not work on the Spaces app, said he “understands where the perception comes from” that Google can appear uncommitted to products. It’s a delicate balance, however, because Google “wants to be a company that is willing to try anything” while also ensuring people that it’s dedicated to its experiments that may not pan out.

By splitting Hangouts into two new apps that both contain the word “Hangouts,” it is opening the door to confusion.

But the new Hangouts apps put ease-of-use at the forefront, Johnston said, and they “can strip away all of the mundane steps” people have to do before they initiate online video conferencing and host online chats.

Perhaps the biggest hurdle Google faces is trying to convince enterprise customers that it’s serious about them, says John Dinsdale, an analyst at Synergy Research, a firm that tracks cloud market share. “The issues of course are around it being late to market and the perception that Google isn’t strong in the enterprise. Until recently Google never gave the impression (through words or deeds) that cloud services were really important to it. It is now trying to make up for lost ground, but AWS and Microsoft are streets ahead,” he explained.

When Kubernetes got started, it was an unnatural act. Google hadn’t contributed to an open source community, but a group of people internally thought they needed to change the game in the cloud and open source was the way to do it. — Scott Raney, Redpoint

But Google has been making some strides using open source to lead the way. Using Kubernetes, the popular open source container orchestration system as an example, Scott Raney, a partner at venture capitalist firm Redpoint, says it showed that Google could offer robust open source tools, something that surprised some people in this market.

“When Kubernetes got started, it was an unnatural act. Google hadn’t contributed to an open source community, but a group of people internally thought they needed to change the game in the cloud and open source was the way to do it,” Raney said.

Kubernetes, and indeed all of the open source projects being generated by Google, such as TensorFlow for machine learning, Spanner for launching massive distributed databases or Draco for 3D graphics compression, to name but a few, were part of a concerted and deliberate effort in-house to be a more open organization.

Resistance is futile

That openness is what attracted GCP VP of product management, Sam Ramji to Google last November when he joined the company from Cloud Foundry. Ramji admits he wasn’t looking for a job, but he was pleasantly surprised to find such an open philosophy, and he saw the chance to shape Google Cloud into a developer-friendly platform — an opportunity, he says, that was too good to pass up.

“My job is to make [the open philosophy] happen and to make it real,” Ramji explained. He said that, when he spoke to Google VP of cloud platforms Brian Stevens last year about taking this job, he hadn’t considered Google a place to work on open things. When he was told the vision was to make GCP the open cloud, “I thought that was really a shock,” he said.

That openness philosophy runs the gamut now including letting customers run whatever open source stack they choose on Google’s infrastructure, releasing and supporting open source projects and making the ecosystem, the partners who build tools and technologies on top of GCP, a first class citizen on the platform. “We are treating them as part of the whole and the net is bringing the tech you want and using Google technology or using any of the [partner] services,” Ramji said.

For example, its open source poster child, Kubernetes, can run on any platform. Just recently Microsoft announced Kubernetes on Azure. Ramji also points out with some excitement that there is more TensorFlow adoption on AWS than there is on GCP, which could be even more shocking than Kubernetes on Azure.

Make it so

The question becomes, how do you differentiate yourself in a crowded market and Redpoint’s Raney says the way to win over developers is being open. “They need to win the hearts and minds of developers. Clearly Amazon has done that. If you’re Google, how do you play this game? You can’t just roll out similar services,” he said.

“The fact that these guys have become much more supportive of the open source community makes people feel better about Google and makes developers feel better about working with their tools because they can avoid lock-in,” he added.

In fact, one of the biggest things that has frustrated enterprise buyers with traditional technology vendors was getting locked in, Greg DeMichillie, director of product management explained.

“We invest as much in what it takes to get off of [our platform] as we have in getting on because we honestly believe open source and open APIs will be critical. Every enterprise you talk to signed contracts with ‘Oracles’ and other companies and they seemed like good deals, and in the end they were not happy — and the cloud is an opportunity not to repeat that mistake,” he said.

Forrester cloud analyst Dave Bartoletti says the company also could take advantage of its strength around data and analytics. “If I’ve got a terabyte of data with customer sentiment, how can I throw it on a platform and run machine learning algorithms and get useful answers to use — and make open source for even the partners to get something going,” he asked. This is precisely what Google is doing.

Greene, speaking at the Goldman Sachs conference last month, pointed to data and analytics as a special strength for the company. When asked by the moderator what the easiest path to the enterprise could be, she answered that it was around data management and analytics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exploring the Relationship Between Architecture Coupling and Software Vulnerabilities: A Google Chrome Case

Overview — Managing software vulnerabilities is a top issue in today’s society. By studying the Google Chrome codebase, the authors explore software metrics including architecture coupling measures in relation to software vulnerabilities. This paper adds new findings to research on software metrics and vulnerabilities, bringing the field closer to generalizable and conclusive results.

Author Abstract

Employing software metrics, such as size and complexity, for predicting defects has been given a lot of attention over the years and has proven very useful. However, the few studies looking at software architecture and vulnerabilities are limited in scope and findings. We explore the relationship between software vulnerabilities and component metrics (like code churn and cyclomatic complexity) as well as architecture coupling metrics (direct, indirect, and cyclic coupling). Our case is based on the Google Chromium project, an open-source project that has not yet been studied for this topic. Our findings show a strong relationship between vulnerabilities and both component level metrics and architecture coupling metrics. Unfortunately, the effects of different types of coupling are somewhat hard to distinguish.

Dubbed “Verifiable Data Audit”, the plan is to create a special digital ledger that automatically records every interaction with patient data in a cryptographically verifiable manner. This means any changes to, or access of, the data would be visible.

DeepMind has been working in partnership with London’s Royal Free Hospital to develop kidney monitoring software called Streams and has faced criticism from patient groups for what they claim are overly broad data sharing agreements. Critics fear that the data sharing has the potential to give DeepMind, and thus Google, too much power over the NHS.

In a blogpost, DeepMind co-founder, Mustafa Suleyman, and head of security and transparency, Ben Laurie, use an example relating to the Royal Free Hospital partnership to explain how the system will work. “[An] entry will record the fact that a particular piece of data has been used, and also the reason why, for example, that blood test data was checked against the NHS national algorithm to detect possible acute kidney injury,” they write.

Suleyman says that development on the data audit proposal began long before the launch of Streams, when Laurie, the co-creator of the widely-used Apache server software, was hired by DeepMind. “This project has been brewing since before we started DeepMind Health,” he told the Guardian, “but it does add another layer of transparency.

“Our mission is absolutely central, and a core part of that is figuring out how we can do a better job of building trust. Transparency and better control of data is what will build trust in the long term.” Suleyman pointed to a number of efforts DeepMind has already undertaken in an attempt to build that trust, from its founding membership of the industry group Partnership on AI to its creation of a board of independent reviewers for DeepMind Health, but argued the technical methods being proposed by the firm provide the “other half” of the equation.



Nicola Perrin, the head of the Wellcome Trust’s “Understanding Patient Data” taskforce, welcomed the verifiable data audit concept. “There are a lot of calls for a robust audit trail to be able to track exactly what happens to personal data, and particularly to be able to check how data is used once it leaves a hospital or NHS Digital. DeepMind are suggesting using technology to help deliver that audit trail, in a way that should be much more secure than anything we have seen before.”

Perrin said the approach could help address DeepMind’s challenge of winning over the public. “One of the main criticisms about DeepMind’s collaboration with the Royal Free was the difficulty of distinguishing between uses of data for care and for research. This type of approach could help address that challenge, and suggests they are trying to respond to the concerns.



“Technological solutions won’t be the only answer, but I think will form an important part of developing trustworthy systems that give people more confidence about how data is used.”

The systems at work are loosely related to the cryptocurrency bitcoin, and the blockchain technology that underpins it. DeepMind says: “Like blockchain, the ledger will be append-only, so once a record of data use is added, it can’t later be erased. And like blockchain, the ledger will make it possible for third parties to verify that nobody has tampered with any of the entries.”

Laurie downplays the similarities. “I can’t stop people from calling it blockchain related,” he said, but he described blockchains in general as “incredibly wasteful” in the way they go about ensuring data integrity: the technology involves blockchain participants burning astronomical amounts of energy – by some estimates as much as the nation of Cyprus – in an effort to ensure that a decentralised ledger can’t be monopolised by any one group.

DeepMind argues that health data, unlike a cryptocurrency, doesn’t need to be decentralised – Laurie says at most it needs to be “federated” between a small group of healthcare providers and data processors – so the wasteful elements of blockchain technology need not be imported over. Instead, the data audit system uses a mathematical function called a Merkle tree, which allows the entire history of the data to be represented by a relatively small record, yet one which instantly shows any attempt to rewrite history.

Although not technologically complete yet, DeepMind already has high hopes for the proposal, which it would like to see form the basis of a new model for data storage and logging in the NHS overall, and potentially even outside healthcare altogether. Right now, says Suleyman, “It’s really difficult for people to know where data has moved, when, and under which authorised policy. Introducing a light of transparency under this process I think will be very useful to data controllers, so they can verify where their processes have used or moved or accessed data.

“That’s going to add technical proof to the governance transparency that’s already in place. The point is to turn that regulation into a technical proof.”

In the long-run, Suleyman says, the audit system could be expanded so that patients can have direct oversight over how and where their data has been used. But such a system would come a long time in the future, once concerns over how to secure access have been solved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Choose well, and these high-risk yet potentially high-reward stocks can deliver multibagger returns and turbocharge your portfolio's overall performance. But choose poorly, and a small-cap stock can produce painful losses, up to and including a complete loss of capital should the business be forced into bankruptcy.

That's why it's so important to invest in only the best of these businesses -- those poised to benefit from undeniable long-term trends and enjoy the largest growth opportunities. Read on to learn about one such business that meets these challenging criteria -- and that is one of the small-cap stocks best positioned to reward investors in the years ahead.

Mindbody (NASDAQ: MB) provides cloud-based software solutions to the health and wellness industry: Think spas, yoga studios, and fitness classes. It's a massive market that's gone largely underserved -- and Mindbody is working to address that need.

Mindbody's all-in-one solution helps its clients manage nearly every aspect of their businesses. Need to post an online class schedule and allow your clients to book appointments through their smartphones? Mindbody has you covered. Want an easy way to manage your employees' schedules? No problem. How about processing payments? Mindbody can help you with that, too.

With plans starting at just $75 per month, Mindbody's offerings are affordable even for start-ups with the most limited financial resources. And an increasing number of larger businesses are utilizing Mindbody's more extensive -- and higher-priced -- packages. In this way, Mindbody is able to scale its business along with the success of its customers.

More than 60,000 businesses have turned to Mindbody's platform for these solutions. That's up from less than 34,000 subscribers in the first quarter of 2014. During this time, Mindbody's revenue has nearly doubled from $70 million in 2014 to $139 million last year.

Still, Mindbody is not yet profitable , which is likely why its stock is currently trading for around $27; properly valuing early-stage growth companies can be difficult. But at that price, Mindbody's current $1.1 billion market cap drastically understates its market potential. The 60,000 businesses Mindbody currently serves are just a tiny fraction -- about 1.5% -- of the 4.2 million wellness businesses that the company says exists around the world. And its $139 million in revenue is just a smidgeon of the $9.5 billion that Mindbody estimates as the current size of its addressable market -- a market that itself is growing, as more people come to understand the benefits of fitness and overall healthier living. That's a massive untapped opportunity that could offer Mindbody years -- and potentially even decades -- of strong growth.

Mindbody's powerful network effects should allow it to capture the lion's share of this immense market. Each new user expands the base of potential customers for Mindbody's business clients, and each business that joins Mindbody's platform increases the number of wellness offerings that users can choose among. It's a virtuous cycle that should continue to grow stronger as Mindbody expands its user and subscriber counts in the coming years.

To further strengthen its ecosystem, Mindbody reached a deal with Under Armour (NYSE: UA) (NYSE: UAA) that lets the more than 180 million users of Under Armour's MyFitnessPal app sign up for classes offered by Mindbody's subscribers. Mindbody also has a partnership with Alphabet 's Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) allowing people in several major cities to book classes listed on Mindbody directly through Google Search and Maps. These two titans choosing to partner with Mindbody is a major vote of confidence for its platform, and I wouldn't be surprised if a company like Under Armour makes a bid for Mindbody at some point in the future.

All told, Mindbody is a leader in a huge and expanding industry with the ability to grow its market share exponentially in the years ahead. And at current prices, Mindbody offers long-term investors a chance at multibagger-type returns in the coming decade. That makes this currently small-cap stock a great buy today.

A group of institutional investors have approached stock index providers S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI to bar the shares from becoming part of several major indexes. Their argument is that one of the criteria for inclusion in the indexes is ""a corporate governance structure consistent with U.S. practice."" Snap's corporate structure is quite unusual, with the founders holding about 90% of the voting rights, and average investors holding no votes at all.

Excluding Snap shares from the S&P 500 may not sound like a big deal -- it doesn't affect the underlying fundamentals of the company. But the growing popularity of index funds and ETFs means Snap will miss out on billions of dollars of buyer support that early investors may have been expecting down the road.

$6 trillion and growing

Index funds and ETFs are expected to overtake actively managed investments in the next seven years or so, according to Moody's. Currently, investors have plowed $6 trillion in assets into the passive investments. $2 trillion of those assets track the S&P 500 index.

Getting added to the S&P 500 is a big deal. When Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) was added to the S&P 500, it received an immediate 7% bump in its share price. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) received a 4% boost upon the news that it would have a place in the index.

What's more, the stocks continued to benefit for some time as active funds that are benchmarked against the index were compelled to buy more shares of the heavily weighted stocks. Alphabet and Facebook are two of the largest companies in the S&P 500. Snap, with its market cap floating around $30 billion, would be more moderately weighted than both, but it would still see similar benefits.

Snap knew this was a possibility

In Snap's S-1 filing with the SEC, it wrote that it couldn't predict whether its decision to make its Class A shares non-voting ""will result in adverse publicity or other adverse consequences."" Certainly, it saw it as a possibility, and it even noted that no other company has made an IPO with non-voting shares.

While Snap's capital structure is different from those of most U.S. companies, it's worth noting that it's not the only company with non-voting shares. In fact, Alphabet has two publicly traded share classes -- one voting and one non-voting -- and it's included in the S&P 500. Likewise, Facebook plans to issue two non-voting (Class C) shares to current shareholders of any class under its approved stock split plan.

But the fact that investors cannot buy voting shares of Snap on the open market makes its situation unique.

How will it impact investors?

While having buyer support in the form of institutional investors is a nice insurance policy, it's not the only thing that matters. After all, the primary driver of a stock's value is the underlying company's performance. If Snap can continue growing its user base and revenue at a rapid clip, the share price should inevitably climb to meet its fundamental performance.

There are a lot of question marks surrounding Snap, especially in light of the recent slowdown in user growth seemingly brought on by the increased intensity of Facebook's competition. The potential for several major indexes to exclude the stock make it even riskier.

Google Cloud Takes Aim at AWS, Azure

The public cloud is currently dominated by Amazon’s AWS, with over 30% of the market — triple the footprint of second-place Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Azure. Google cloud is in fourth place, trailing International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM ).

The cloud is a huge market already and it’s expected to get far larger, quickly. Forrester recently pegged the expected value of the public cloud — services like AWS, Azure and Google Cloud — to reach $236 billion by 2020.

And Google wants a bigger piece of that pie.

At its Next 2017 conference keynote, the company made the case for choosing Google cloud over AWS or Azure. While noting that it has invested $30 billion in its cloud services, the company rattled off an impressive list of companies that have recently made the move to Google cloud. eBay Inc. (NASDAQ: EBAY ) and Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE: CL ) represent the large corporate side of Google cloud’s capabilities, while popular apps like Pokemon Go and Snap Inc.’s (NYSE: SNAP ) Snapchat show off its suitability for hosting consumer apps.

Google cloud’s head Diane Greene, took the opportunity to fire a shot at Amazon’s AWS and the bad PR it’s received for large-scale outages. Chances are, you were affected by an AWS issue at the end of February that slowed or took down thousands of websites, apps and services for hours.

Greene noted that Google cloud has been recognized for topping all cloud service providers in availability for 2016. She puts that availability level at 99.999% reliability, which is very impressive.

It certainly makes a case for switching from AWS.

The New York-based company was plagued by operational problems and losing market share in 2015 when Verizon offered $50 per share to get access to its ad technology, Tim Armstrong, told a Delaware Chancery Court judge on Wednesday. Armstrong testified in a lawsuit filed by investors who claimed they were shortchanged in the deal.

“Our bucket was leaking every year to the tune of $10 million in losses and some years $100 million,’’ Armstrong said. “The Verizon offer was a good deal for the company.’’

Investment funds holding more than 8 million AOL shares want Chancery Judge Sam Glasscock to find that the Verizon deal undervalued the former Internet portal by more than $1.5 billion. The funds’ shares are worth more than $400 million at the deal’s current valuation, according to court filings. Shareholders are seeking nearly $19 more per share in the appraisal case.

Verizon, the nation’s largest wireless provider, is looking to media investments as growth slows in the mobile-phone industry. It bought AOL for its online-advertising assets and it’s buying Yahoo! Inc.’s Internet business for $4.48 billion.

‘You’ve Got Mail’

The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter.

Once called America Online, AOL was one of the main pathways through which people first accessed the Internet. Its famous “You’ve Got Mail’’ slogan heralded the rise of email as a popular form of communication. The company’s trajectory peaked with a now-infamous $124 billion combination with Time Warner Inc. in 2000, after which it began losing customers to faster services from telephone and cable-television carriers. After years of losses the merger was unwound with a spinoff in late 2009.

AOL transformed itself into an Internet-advertising force, focusing on online video and programmatic advertising, which uses computer algorithms rather than salespeople to buy and sell ad space on websites. That system helps companies gather data and more efficiently target ads to specific consumers.

Still, the company struggled to meet its strategic goals, Armstrong said in court. The company hired investment bankers in 2014 to seek out offers from online giants such as Google, Facebook and Microsoft Corp., Armstrong said. They weren’t interested, he added.

Yahoo Combination

AOL also considered joining forces with Yahoo, another struggling Internet company, at the behest of some of its shareholders, Armstrong said. The CEO noted in an October 2014 email that “everybody knows there are synergies’’ in terms of costs and revenue from such a deal. Yahoo officials ultimately backed away from a combination, he added.

AOL directors agreed to the Verizon buyout in May 2015 after it added $3 per share to its original $47 bid, Armstrong said. “It was a very strong match,” he added.

During cross-examination, lawyers for shareholders said Armstrong failed to mention the buyout talks with Google, Microsoft and Facebook in securities filings and painted a rosier picture of the company’s prospects on 2014 and 2015 investor earnings calls than he did in court.

“From your testimony, AOL sounded like a company in trouble,’’ Mary Thomas, one of the investors’ lawyers, said. “But you told investors in a 2015 call that you’d had some success with your strategy’’ of transforming the company into an online advertising power.

“Isn’t that a different picture than the one you painted here today?’’ Thomas asked Armstrong.

“Same picture,’’ Armstrong replied, noting that he’d laid out the company’s difficulties in claiming market share and operational miscues as part of his testimony before Glasscock.

YOU MIGHT NOT be familiar with all 13 pioneering women featured today on Google’s home page. That, in fact, is part of the point. To celebrate International Women’s Day, the team behind the slide show Doodle hopes to fuel the viewer’s own hunger for discovery.

“I hope people are excited to learn more about these” heroes on their own, said the Doodle’s artist, Olivia Huynh, for whom the elegant slide show was a two-month labor of love.

In choosing to dramatize that sparked sense of discovery, Huynh said she was inspired by the fact that many of the women in her own life, including several relatives, are storytellers.

“The Doodle itself is a frame narrative about this girl and her grandmother, [who] is telling her the story of one of her heroes,” Huynh told The Washington Post’s Comic Riffs. “And that inspires the girl to go and look at other women in history, and so she [has] an imaginative journey. … At the end, she comes back to her grandmother and has so many things to tell her.”

The slide show’s 13 heroes have each previously received individual Doodles. Because today’s Doodle will appear worldwide, the artist said, Google chose “people of diverse backgrounds and diverse global locations.”

The globe-spanning array of women spotlighted in Google’s slide show are (in order): Ida B. Wells, Lotfia El Nadi, Frida Kahlo, Lina Bo Bardi, Olga Skorokhodova, Miriam Makeba, Sally Ride, Halet Çambel, Ada Lovelace, Rukmini Devi (Arundale), Cecilia Grierson, Lee Tai-young and Suzanne Lenglen.

The first National Women’s Day, which was backed by the Socialist Party of America largely over labor rights, was observed in the United States in 1909. Two years later, International Women’s Day was marked in numerous European countries, as more than a million people reportedly attended rallies for women’s rights.

“International Women’s Day has become a powerful day for women activists banding together to have their voice heard,” Glenda Stone, founder of the global hub InternationalWomensDay.com , told Comic Riffs in 2012. “It has also become a mainstream day for celebrating the success of women in all fields across all countries.

For the Texas-born Huynh — who studied animation at the Maryland Institute College of Art — today’s Doodle was a very personal project.

“If I could do anything on Women’s Day, it would be to look back at my heroes [and] tell them how much they’ve influenced me,” said Huynh, who pitched the Doodle’s concept as a virtual time-traveling tribute. She believes most people would readily “go back in time and tell their heroes: ‘Thank you.’”

From that inspiration, Huynh — who was hired at Google two years ago (after traveling to festivals with her thesis film, “Borrowed Light”) — sat on the floor last December and began to churn out “no pressure” sketches. On that occasion, the visual ideas flowed easily.

As Huynh worked on the Doodle, she felt especially fortunate to have so many supportive women in her workplace. In contrast to much of the hiring in Silicon Valley, Team Google Doodle is diverse in its gender balance. “It’s great to have women around whose opinions are really helpful in a super-supportive environment,” the artist said.

And as her Doodle goes out into the world, Huynh said she hopes it “inspires people to see women doing these things.”

“It’s like the great quote,” she said. “‘You can’t be what you can’t see.’”

* Fed rate meeting on March 14-15 * Financials among top gainers; utilities top drag * Dow down 0.03 pct, S&P up 0.11 pct, Nasdaq up 0.38 pct (Adds details, comments, updates prices) By Yashaswini SwamynathanMarch 8 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average swung between losses and gains on Wednesday after a strong private hiring report raised the odds of an interest rate hike next week, lifting bank stocks while dragging rate-sensitive sectors. The ADP National Employment report showed the U.S. private sector added 298,000 jobs last month, far bigger than 190,000 that economists on average had estimated. [nZON1YYR00] The data acts a precursor to Friday's nonfarm payrolls report, which includes private and public sector jobs and acts as a barometer of the U.S. economy. The S&P 500 financial index <.SPSY> was up 0.63 percent, led by big banks such as Citigroup <C.N>, Bank of America <BAC.N> and Wells Fargo <WFC.N>. However, the impact was offset by a 1 percent decline in high-dividend paying utilities <.SPLRCU> and real estate <.SPLRCR> sectors. The dollar gathered strength, while gold - which tends to lose value in a rising rates environment - was lower. ""Equities are at the crossroads of optimism and concern and are likely to go sideways until we get greater clarity from the Fed and legislative action,"" said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis. Investors are also digesting a strong post-election rally that has driven the main indexes to record highs, sparking some concern over market valuations. ""I think to a degree, equities are priced to perfection and there are several indicators that point to caution,"" Sandven said. The S&P 500 is trading at about 18 times forward earnings estimates against the long-term average of about 15 times, according to Thomson Reuters data. At 10:58 a.m. ET (1558 GMT), the Dow <.DJI> was down 6.88 points, or 0.03 percent, at 20,917.88 and the S&P 500 <.SPX> was up 2.5 points, or 0.11 percent, at 2,370.89. The Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> was up 22.15 points, or 0.38 percent, at 5,856.08, boosted by gains in Microsoft <MSFT.O> and Alphabet <GOOG.O>. Caterpillar <CAT.N> kept the Dow in the red, declining 1.2 percent after the New York Times said it reviewed a report commissioned by the U.S. government that accused the heavy equipment maker of carrying out tax and accounting fraud. Exxon <XOM.N> and Chevron <CVX.N> were the top drags on the S&P as oil prices slipped 1.4 percent. [O/R] Urban Outfitters <URBN.O> was the biggest percentage loser on the S&P, with a 4.8 percent decline following a sales miss that prompted William Blair to downgrade the stock and other brokerages to cut price targets. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,651 to 1,166. On the Nasdaq, 1,433 issues rose and 1,178 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 12 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 46 new highs and 27 new lows.

Shares of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) rebounded nicely following their short-lived but sharp post-earnings selloff in late January. This very ability of GOOGL stock to recover so quickly speaks to underlying demand and a multimonth uptrend that active investors and traders must respect until proven otherwise.

When I last discussed Alphabet stock on Jan. 9 , I said that shares appeared to have good upside potential into late January. I wanted to target the $845-$850 area before the Jan. 26 earnings report. The stock reached the upper end of this price range by Jan. 24.

Note that this was specifically a pre-earnings trade; the goal was to get out before Alphabet's report on Jan. 26.

Why? Because empirically, trying to time a specific post-earnings outcome for any given stock has at best a 50% chance of success.

While parts of the broader stock market showed some signs of volatility in recent days, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 - as represented by the PowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1(ETF) (NASDAQ: QQQ ) - continues to motor higher. Both GOOGL stock and GOOG stock, being an important part of this index often times can flash important signals as to the next directional move in the Nasdaq-100.

GOOGL Stock Charts

Looking at the big-picture multiyear weekly chart of Alphabet, we see that the uptrend (purple-dotted parallels) remains well intact. However, GOOGL is now bumping up against the very upper end of this range.



Click to Enlarge

Another way of looking at this trading channel is to note that previous attempts at overshooting to the upside failed. As such, traders and investors primarily want to respect the trend.

The weekly chart provides some perspective as to the possibility of another explosive move higher from here. In fairness, that likelihood is fairly low in this time frame - at least without some sort of sideways consolidation, if not an outright corrective move lower to the middle or lower end of said channel.

On the daily chart, we see that GOOGL stock last November and December found support at its 200-day simple moving average (red). This was followed by a rally that pushed the stock back above its 50-day MA (yellow), which acted as support in early January and early February.



Click to Enlarge

The sharp rebound following a multiday selloff on the back of the January earnings report is impressive. By last week, it had GOOGL stock bumping right back at the pre-earnings levels around $860.

Although the stock has taken a little breather in recent days, on Monday, shares closed well off their intraday lows. Follow-through buying commenced on Tuesday.

Active investors and traders can now use Monday's lows around $840 as a stop-loss to play the stock higher for a trade to new highs with a first upside price target around $870-$880.

More conservative traders may want to first wait for GOOGL stock to close back above the $855 area before legging into this trade.

Few names in the markets have almost universal appeal. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is one of them. Sure, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) products have more appeal, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG ,NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is more popular and Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is more engaging, but let's give credit where credit is due. Most of us have grown up with Microsoft programs, and we continue to use them frequently to this day.

Source: Shutterstock

Of course, emotional sentiment only goes so far. To prove its relevance in a changing world, Microsoft must deliver the goods. For most of this decade, the results for Microsoft stock have been fantastic.

We're talking five out of seven years in the black, with an average annual profit of nearly 14%. In addition, MSFT stock has enjoyed four consecutive years of double-digit growth.

I don't care how many caveats you can mention about the proverbial old dog … that's a trick that's tough to master at any age. Seemingly, the change at the top of the Microsoft war room, from Steve Ballmer to Satya Nadella, is working wonders. Most importantly, the willingness to aggressively push into new territory is encouraging for potential Microsoft shareholders.

InvestorPlace contributor Will Ashworth took this confidence further by declaring that MSFT stock will hit $80 this year . Is this wishful thinking, or is there more to this than mere bravado?

Challenges Facing MSFT stock

First things first - I admire the guts Ashworth displayed. That's putting yourself out there and giving clarity to your point of view. It's something I wish I could see in Washington, but that's a whole different ballgame.

With MSFT stock specifically, the bullish argument is an easy one, but so is the cautious approach. Shares have soared despite the wave of competition in the consumer tech sector. InvestorPlace contributor Vince Martin speaks for a lot of people when he wrote , ""I continue to be surprised at the strength shown by Microsoft stock. MSFT stock has risen roughly 150% in just four years - despite little movement in profits.""

The lack of fundamental growth is even more perplexing when you consider Microsoft's position within the fierce environment. The company is either lagging, or is getting challenged by rising up-and-comers. Martin writes:

""For Office 365, Tableau Software Inc (NYSE: DATA ) is challenging Excel - and 27% revenue growth in 2016 suggests DATA is taking share from MSFT. Behemoths like Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL ) and many others are in the cloud space. Microsoft's Dynamics CRM product is a distant second to salesforce.com, inc . (NYSE: CRM ).""

A huge concern for those trading MSFT stock is the market capitalization. I'm not a fan of focusing on any one metric. Still, with its equity valued at half a trillion dollars, you have to take a step back. Is Microsoft stock really worth that much?



Click to Enlarge Keep in mind that despite four consecutive years of double-digit growth, the magnitude has also declined. The first strike was 39.5% in 2013, followed by performances of 28.4%, 21.9% and 16.5%.

Microsoft Stock Is a Proven Winner

Admittedly, that's not the direction the trend should go. Nevertheless, I think Ashworth is going to be a happy camper. Like other tech names, Microsoft stock starts off the year fairly slowly. For example, its first quarter returns are a relatively pedestrian 8%.

But at year's end, the average return jumps up to 30.7%, nearly four times higher. That also means that those who are concerned about this year's slow start for MSFT stock shouldn't be.

The other attribute that is remarkable about Microsoft is its resiliency. Between 2000 and 2011, MSFT stock suffered a negative Q1 performance ten times. But in four of those instances, shares managed to claw back positive returns for the year. That provides a lot of security for those making strongly optimistic calls for Microsoft stock.

While investors have reason to look at MSFT cautiously, I think Wall Street is giving Nadella and company a fair shake. They want to see what it can do with its long-term strategy, and the signs are encouraging. A prime example is Microsoft's high-profile acquisition of LinkedIn . By integrating its intellectual capital with Microsoft's vast networks, it can do serious damage in the social media sphere.

Overall, $80 for Microsoft stock is very reasonable. Although not dominant, it's competing well in some of the most exciting and high-growth sectors. Both the company and the markets are loving the change in leadership and culture. Finally, Microsoft continues to find ways to do well, even in the most trying of circumstances. The only question is, can I be the first to call $100 in 2018?

As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Can anything stop tech juggernaut Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL )? With AAPL stock now trading at all-time highs, driven by its 27% one-month rise, investors want to know whether it's too late to bite.

Apple stock, which already ranks as the best-performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , closed Monday at $139.34.

AAPL shares have soared nearly 21% year-to-date, crushing not only all the major indexes, but also the performances of FANG stocks Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ).

All told, the Cupertino-based tech giant, which has been on a winning streak over the last year, has made investors tons of money with more than 35% returns. And with some patience, there's still at least 15% gains to be had as AAPL stock is poised to reach $160 in the next 12 to 18 months. How's it going to get there?

Apple Stock's Strength

Aside from the recent endorsement Apple received from billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who revealed on CNBC last week that his Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK.A ) (NYSE: BRK.B ) conglomerate more than doubled its stake in Apple to 133 million shares worth around $17 billion. AAPL has its iPhone 8 and a host of other tailwinds to propel the revenue higher. Rumors suggest that the tenth-anniversary iPhone, which will feature a new OLED display, could sell for more than $1,000 per device.

As such, given that Apple, which sold more than 78 million phones in 2016's holiday quarter, has surpassed Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS: SSNLF ) in market share, according to data just released research firm Gartner, the company should have no problems selling the new iPhones and generating huge profits. What's more, Apple has also become more than just an iPhone shop.

In its fiscal first quarter, Apple's Services revenue, which includes Apple Music, the App Store, iCloud, Apple Care and Apple Pay, grew 17.5% year-over-year to $7.17 billion, topping forecasts of $6.91 billion. With Services quickly becoming the company's second-largest business segment, Apple appears better balanced going forward. And all of this makes AAPL stock less risky, despite its all-time high status.

Bottom Line for AAPL Stock

When factoring Apple's massive cash stockpile of more than $250 billion, AAPL stock - despite trading at all-time highs - still looks like a bargain. Based on fiscal 2017 consensus estimates of $8.94 per share, Apple stock is priced at just 15.5x earnings-per-share, which is about four points below the S&P 500 index. Assuming AAPL was priced on par with the rest of the market, the shares would trade today at around $170. In other words, even the a $160 target looks too conservative.

YouTube TV will include 40 live channels and will be initially available in select markets.

While YouTube TV is missing quite a few channels compared with competing services, it has the potential to attract a lot of attention from media companies in the future thanks to one huge advantage over the competitors: Google, the Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary and owner of YouTube, is one of the best digital video advertisers in the world.

Image source: YouTube

Disney already sees the value in digital streaming

Disney (NYSE: DIS) CEO Bob Iger is actively trying to get his networks into digital skinny bundles. Indeed, Disney's networks, including ESPN, are available in the lowest-priced tiers of all of the aforementioned streaming services.

Importantly, Disney is not sacrificing any of its affiliate fees to get its channels into those tiers. ""The per-channel fees, which we are not getting too specific about, are commensurate with what the fees are on the existing services,"" Iger said about its deal with DirecTV Now.

But there's an added benefit to going digital. ""Some of the technology platforms will offer dynamic ad insertion. We think that that has got some real potential for the company,"" Iger told investors on the company's third-quarter earnings call last year.

Dynamic ad insertion allows media companies to serve targeted ads to viewers instead of using the one-size-fits-all system of traditional live broadcasts. YouTube TV may give media companies the opportunity to tap into Google's targeting data. On top of that, YouTube already has millions of advertisers on its platform, which it could tap for more premium YouTube TV ads.

Media companies might give YouTube TV a bigger break on affiliate fees if it can produce meaningfully higher ad revenue per viewer than its competitors.

YouTube will have a chance to prove itself, too

Media companies will handle the majority of their ad buying at the launch of YouTube TV, but YouTube will have access to about two minutes of ads for every hour of viewing. That's the ad inventory that every cable company receives. If YouTube can use its decade of advertising experience and produce outsize results, it could increase interest from media companies for its services.

That bit of advertising is about the only thing that will make YouTube TV profitable, as analysts estimate its affiliate fees total about $29 before accounting for various regional sports networks, which could add $4 to $5.

Suffice it to say YouTube TV has a lot running on that small slice of advertising inventory.

Taking on a $71 billion market

The market Google is going after with YouTube TV isn't so much the pay-TV market as it is the television advertising market. Google tried to break into the market before by partnering with media companies about a decade ago. Now, it's using YouTube TV as a platform to gain access to that inventory, which generated about $71 billion in the U.S. last year.

Getting YouTube TV off the ground and showing media companies what it's capable of with advertising is the first step. The more successful it is with its own ad inventory, the more likely it is to win the business of more media companies. In turn, more customers will sign up as the value improves and YouTube is able to bring on more networks.

If YouTube TV is successful, it will be because its superior advertising makes it a win-win-win -- the media companies, the consumers, and YouTube.

Speaking at the event, Google CEO Sundar Pichai made it clear that he sees Google Cloud as an incredibly important part of the search giant's future, and not just one of the company's many side bets. ""To me, Google Cloud is a natural extension of our mission to make the world's information accessible and usable,"" Pichai said.

The distinction is that while search helps regular users access information, cloud computing infrastructure and the related value-added services like analytics help the enterprise organize and access their information. The cloud infrastructure market is booming, growing 49% last year to $38.1 billion, according to market researcher Canalys. It's expected to jump another 46% this year to $55.8 billion. As the market grows, so, too, does the impact on the financials of the major players: Google Cloud, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure, and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) AWS.

Google data center in Council Bluffs, Iowa. Image source: Google.

As such, the former two should start disclosing exactly how much cloud revenue they're bringing in.

Follow Amazon's lead

I never thought I'd see the day when Amazon was leading the way in investor transparency, given the e-commerce giant's long-standing refusal to share various operating metrics that are pertinent to investors. Yet, when it comes to AWS and cloud revenue, Amazon is doing just that; Amazon started sharing AWS financials in 2015. AWS revenue was $12.2 billion last year, translating into $3.1 billion in operating income.

Microsoft only discloses growth rates for Azure (up 93% last quarter), but lacking a base number, that data point is less meaningful. We do know that total revenue in Microsoft's intelligent cloud segment, which includes Azure among other offerings, was $6.9 billion last quarter, resulting in $2.4 billion in operating income. Lacking an official figure, JPMorgan analysts estimate Azure revenue for all of 2016 was $2.7 billion, which would make AWS nearly five times bigger.

Google includes Google Cloud revenue within its Google other revenues segment, which generated a hair over $10 billion in sales in 2016. That also includes revenue from Google Play as well as the company's growing hardware portfolio. One particularly prominent Google Cloud customer that just went public likely spent between $400 million to $450 million last year, and is committed to $400 million per year for the next five years , so there's that.

Sharing is caring

You could reasonably argue that AWS is far more important to Amazon than its peers' respective cloud businesses, though, specifically since AWS is by far the market leader and it's such a major contributor to profitability due to razor-thin margins in the core e-commerce business. In contrast, Google and Microsoft enjoy much higher gross margin, as they each specialize in software and services.

Still, the cloud infrastructure market is only going to become increasingly important in the years ahead, and investors will want to see the results from the three largest players to assess each company's competitiveness. Google and Microsoft should start sharing more, especially if it's as important as Pichai says it is.

This very ability of GOOGL stock to recover so quickly speaks to underlying demand and a multimonth uptrend that active investors and traders must respect until proven otherwise.

When I last discussed Alphabet stock on Jan. 9, I said that shares appeared to have good upside potential into late January. I wanted to target the $845-$850 area before the Jan. 26 earnings report. The stock reached the upper end of this price range by Jan. 24.

Note that this was specifically a pre-earnings trade; the goal was to get out before Alphabet’s report on Jan. 26.

Why? Because empirically, trying to time a specific post-earnings outcome for any given stock has at best a 50% chance of success.

While parts of the broader stock market showed some signs of volatility in recent days, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 — as represented by the PowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (ETF) (NASDAQ: QQQ ) — continues to motor higher. Both GOOGL stock and GOOG stock, being an important part of this index often times can flash important signals as to the next directional move in the Nasdaq-100.

Looking at the big-picture multiyear weekly chart of Alphabet, we see that the uptrend (purple-dotted parallels) remains well intact. However, GOOGL is now bumping up against the very upper end of this range.

Google Has Upside and Wall Street is Missing It

2017-03-08

While the smartphone numbers we looked at above are interesting, it's all really just conversation for Google.



The company has essentially zero footprint in the smartphone market with respect to actual hardware, so even if smartphones were shrinking, the opportunity for Google is to go from ""zero"" to some number greater than zero, and that opportunity is big.

Let Tesla sell its 500,000 cars by 2018 if they can. Alphabet Inc is looking to sell tens of millions within five years, with no cost of production, no assembly line, no radical new business - just the best technology in the world licensed to the largest auto makers in the world.



Now, this isn't done but it's definitely starting and Wall Street is miles behind (no pun intended).

Date Published:Written by Ophir GottliebAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock has enormous upside that may well make it the most promising of the mega cap tech stocks that include Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).Alphabet Inc has seen its revenue and earnings grow essentially unabated. Here is a chart of both metrics:The bars represent revenue (TTM) and the orange line traces net income (TTM), which in English is after tax profit. But, just as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has faced concerns over a diversification of its revenue stream with respect to the iPhone, and as Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) has faced concerns of slowing revenue and earnings growth due to a lack of diversification, so too has Alphabet Inc faced those concerns.That mountain of revenue is about 80% from advertising. Most of that advertising comes from Google's Search, and there has been a concern that as search has moved to mobile, Google has less control over the ecosystem which could give way to Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone, if the company so chose, to move away from Google, and it also means Google now faces advertising competition from Facebook's enormous user base, and even, oddly, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).But, Google has a secret weapon -- in fact, it has, and each has the potential to make up a large cap tech company in and of themselves. We can start with the simple, and move to the breaking news at the end.First, there is this absurd narrative circling that smartphones are doomed to be the next PCs - a dying technology replaced with newer looks, designs and specs. Here is the PC market via our friends at Statista:The PC market is in decline and will continue to be. But, friends, that is not at all emblematic of the smartphone market. Check out this chart from Statista.I don't know what else to say other than, the smartphone market is growing, not shrinking.We wrote a dedicated dossier to Google's new Pixel smartphone Google Has a Huge New Upside Weapon . In that dossier we note the obvious, but somehow wildly misunderstood reality that Wall Street is missing:We must understand that simply launching a smartphone does not mean it will work. Just ask Microsoft. But, as we discuss in that dossier above, Google has done more than just ""launch a phone.""Let's call it an even split at the high end for smartphones, meaning between Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung, about 450 million high end phones have been sold in the last year by the two dominant players.Alphabet Inc's Google Pixel has been given the imprimatur of the tech critic crowd, placing it directly in competition with the Android Samsung flagships and the Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhones. In English, the Google Pixel is a legitimate substitution threat.We'll stop here so not wax rhapsodic (and not to repeat ourselves), but the smartphone market has made Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) the largest company in the world, even a little piece of that market for Alphabet Inc could mean fully a 25% rise in revenue from this opportunity alone. The Pixel 2 was just announced and will be here in 2017.After all of that, you could make an argument thatWe wrote a dossier It's Time to Focus on Google's Cars . In that piece we uncover the magnificence that is Waymo.In the last couple of months Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has spun out its self-driving car segment into a stand-alone company, still under the Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) umbrella, called Waymo. Before we dig into the details, a quick step back. This is the expected growth in the market for self-driving featured cars:For the longest time this project felt like one of the many moonshots that would never really see the light of day - that's what Wall Street would have had us think, at least. But it isn't a moonshot, it's a business - and a rather large one.It was lost in the wind of headlines, but Alphabet inc has already started talks with General Motors and Ford as well as Honda and Chrysler-Fiat. As we note from that dossier:In our recent dossier Google is Gunning for the Cloud , we discuss at length the moves Alphabet Inc is putting on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft to snap that market into its own hands.While the cloud has become more like a colloquialism than a name for a technology, the tailwinds to this technological shift are simply unstoppable at this point. There is too much data and too many connected devices even today, not to speak of the absurdity that is to come, to not have a machine learning driven technology to balance the needs of every website, every app, all the data in complete harmony. Enter the cloud.The worldwide public cloud market is forecast to rise from $154 billion this year to nearly half a trillion dollars by 2026. Right now, there are two distinct leaders. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the undisputed leader and right behind the e-commerce giant is Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Here is a market share chart:While the mainstream media will talk about the battle between Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation, the third place company is none other than Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL).We won't belabor the point here since it is written nice and neat in the dossier noted above, but the point is that the cloud computing market is going to be enormous, and Google has an advantage over both of the incumbents -- there simply is no company that has made more progress in the world of end-to-end machine learning and artificial intelligence than Google.The demands of the cloud will very soon go well past ""having a bunch of servers in a room,"" and well into the realm of advanced analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning. With over 25 billion devices soon to be connected in the Internet of Things, don't be surprised to see Google as the new leader in the cloud -- with an advantage that goes well beyond a well formed API structure and cost savings.Now, that was three of the four secret weapons for Google -- but friends, number four may be larger than all of them.It's just a matter of fact that cord-cutting is coming. In fact, here is a nice visual we put together with data from Statista:Everything from cord-cutters, to people never having cable, to the number of cable subscribers is pointing in the obvious direction of a need for a new way to deliver TV. And Google is the company with an undisputed lead that it may never relinquish.YouTube has more viewers aged 18-49, now listen carefully,than any other network or cable broadcast channel in the United States. Here's what new data just showed:That reality led to one of the biggest stories in technology of the last five years that somehow has received very little notice. On February 28th we learned that Google has partnered to create ""YouTubeTV."" And what is this new ""YouTube TV?"" It's astreaming TV service that will up end cable.Then CNBC added some more flavor:The most recent data puts cable TV subscriptions at just under 50 million, and subscribers to cable broadband now at 55 million. If we use 50 million as our base, that puts the total addressable market (TAM) for Google at 50 million * $40 /month = $2 billion a month, or $24 billion a year,Let's keep our eyes on the ball, here. Alphabet Inc is still an advertising first company, and there is risk to that business as mobile becomes a bigger part, if not the central part, and the ad blocking phenomenon also grows.Further, all of these opportunities, taken as one business at a time, are yet to be proven as winners for Alphabet Inc, although the cloud and YouTube are doing quite well already.If this is the kind of research you seek, beyond all the click bait that clutters the world of ""news,"" then what we offer may be up your alley: Our research sits side-by-side with Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Barclays, JP Morgan, and the rest on professional terminals as a part of the famed Thomson First Call group.

The answers Google gives in featured snippets are sometimes ""terribly wrong,"" says Search Engine Land founding editor Danny Sullivan. (Photo: Josh Edelson, AFP/Getty Images)

The featured snippets are one of the 10 top search results Google displays in a special box. And they are in the spotlight thanks to longtime Google observer Danny Sullivan, founding editor of the blog Search Engine Land. Sullivan says the snippets, which he has dubbed Google's ""one true answer"" feature, can be deeply flawed. How flawed? ""Sometimes these answers are terribly wrong,"" Sullivan says.

Recent examples? One featured snippet claimed some U.S. presidents were members of the Ku Klux Klan. (False). Another claimed President Obama was planning a coup d'etat. (Only if you scrolled down did you stumble on an ABC news story debunking the snippet).

Google isn't even telling you the truth about how long it takes to caramelize onions (""28 minutes if you cooked them as hot as possible and constantly stirred them, 45 minutes if you were sane about it"" but definitely not about five minutes), according to Gizmodo writer Tom Scocca. Or on whether MSG can kill you. (We're pretty sure it can't, at least we hope not).

""The featured snippets feature is an automatic and algorithmic match to the search query, and the content comes from third-party sites,"" Google said in an emailed statement. ""We’re always working to improve our algorithms, and we welcome feedback on incorrect information.""

Users can report incorrect information through a ""Feedback"" button at the bottom right of the featured snippet, Google said.

""Many of Google’s direct answers are correct. Ask Google if vaccines cause autism, and it will tell you they do not. Ask it if jet fuel melts steel beams, and it will pull an answer from a Popular Mechanics article debunking the famous 9/11 conspiracy theory,"" reports web magazine The Outline. ""But it’s easy to find examples of Google grabbing quick answers from shady places.""

One more. As best I can tell, no US presidents were in the KKK yet Google lists five of them. pic.twitter.com/TQJ0Zov2eT — Danny Sullivan (@dannysullivan) March 5, 2017

This is not a minor issue. About 15% of searches return a featured snippet, according to MozCast, a website that tracks the Google algorithm.

And, as Sullivan points out, featured snippets have been returning some pretty wacky answers for a couple of years now. It's a problem that will only get worse as people become more and more dependent on voice-activated assistants such as Google Home to fetch quick answers.

I know @ruskin147 already shared this, but here's my own Google Home informing me Obama plans a coup. pic.twitter.com/gs0s0ivF3L — Danny Sullivan (@dannysullivan) March 5, 2017

The featured snippets problem comes as Google and Facebook are taking heat for doing too little to curb fake news during the presidential election.

So what does Sullivan recommend?

""The easy solution would be for Google to stop using featured snippets,"" he says. ""That doesn’t mean that Google wouldn’t come under criticism for bad results. After all, featured snippets come from one of the 10 web listings that are presented. One or more of those listings might still be problematic. But at least a problematic result wouldn’t get elevated to such exalted status, subjecting Google to greater criticism.""

Unfortunately that would undercut Google as it battles with Apple and Amazon for dominance in the next wave of search, voice-activated assistants, so a non-starter.

But wait, what's the answer?

""In the end, I don’t know that there’s a perfect answer,"" Sullivan says. ""But Google clearly needs to do something.""

Good news for folks who don't want to play Russian roulette with featured snippets: You can opt out of them.

But the growth of digital platforms like Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) and Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google make it easy to reach hundreds of millions of people. What's more, you can target your message so it only reaches the most qualified potential buyers.

That's why digital has been eating into television ad budgets -- and why analysts expect that trend to continue for the foreseeable future. eMarketer forecasts that digital advertising spend in the U.S. will climb to $113 billion by 2020, while TV ad spend grows much more slowly, reaching just $77 billion. Digital spend just surpassed television last year.

One of the biggest beneficiaries of the shift of ad budgets from television to digital is Facebook.

Image source: Facebook.

A Super Bowl every day

Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg once likened Facebook's reach to the largest television event. ""We have a Super Bowl on mobile every day,"" she said.

And it's true. Facebook has 1.23 billion daily active users -- 1.14 billion on mobile and 180 million in the U.S. and Canada. The Super Bowl earlier this year attracted 111.3 million viewers in the U.S.

Granted the Super Bowl lasts something like five hours (more if Tom Brady sends it into overtime). The average Facebook user spends ""just"" 50 minutes per day across Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger, the last of which doesn't yet show ads.

However, the average American watches less television today than they did a few years ago. View time across all age groups fell 11% in the six years ending last fall. The trend is more pronounced among younger people. People between 18 and 24 spent 35% less time watching traditional television during the second quarter last year compared to the second quarter of 2010, according to Nielsen.

While Facebook isn't the only reason people are watching less TV, it presents a very good option for advertisers looking to replace that lost watch time.

Facebook is taking a huge share of digital advertising growth

Digital advertising is growing rapidly, but that doesn't mean all of that ad spend will go to Facebook. Nonetheless, Facebook has done an excellent job winning those new ad dollars flowing from television ad budgets to digital.

In the third quarter last year, Facebook took 45% of all digital advertising growth. Google managed to take 54% of advertising growth, leaving just 1% of growth for everyone else.

Facebook is poised to continue capturing a lion's share of digital ad spend growth in the future, too. Display advertising is the largest form of digital advertising today, and eMarketer expects that to remain the case in the future. Facebook holds a wide lead in display advertising, bringing in around $12 billion in the U.S. last year compared to less than $5 billion for Google.

Facebook is also working to attract more video content to its platform, which fits nicely with the trend of shifting ad budgets. Facebook is reportedly funding new content productions for its platform in the hopes of seeding an entire ecosystem similar to YouTube. YouTube has proven extremely lucrative for Google, and Facebook wants in on the billions of digital video adverting revenue it generates every year.

Not only are ad budgets shifting from television to digital, Facebook is one of the few companies that's been able to attract those ad dollars thanks to its audience size, engagement, and ad targeting capabilities. As the trend continues through the end of the decade, that makes Facebook an awesome buy.

UPDATE 2-WikiLeaks says it has secret CIA hacking tools



(Rewrites with details, comments and background) By Dustin Volz and Warren StrobelWASHINGTON, March 7 (Reuters) - Anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks on Tuesday said it had obtained a secret trove of hacking tools used by the CIA to break into or circumvent the security of phones, communication apps and other devices, and published confidential documents describing those programs. Among the most noteworthy WikiLeaks claims are that the Central Intelligence Agency, in partnership with other U.S. and foreign agencies, has been able to bypass the encryption on popular messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal, by hacking phones that use Google Inc's <GOOG.O> Android platform to collect audio and message traffic before encryption is applied. Reuters could not immediately verify the contents of the published documents, but several contractors and private cyber security experts said the materials, dated between 2013 and 2016, appeared to be legitimate. The information in what WikiLeaks said were 7,818 web pages with 943 attachments appears to represent the latest in a string of breaches in recent years of classified material from U.S. intelligence agencies. Experts differed over how much the disclosures will damage U.S. cyber espionage. Many said that, while harmful, they do not compare to former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden's revelations in 2013 of intrusive NSA surveillance. Stuart McClure, CEO of Cylance, an Irvine, California, cyber security firm, said that one of the most significant disclosures shows how CIA hackers cover their tracks by leaving trails suggesting they are from Russia, China and Iran rather than the United States. Other revelations show how the CIA took advantage of vulnerabilities that are known, if not widely publicized. In one case, the documents say, U.S. and British personnel, under a program known as Weeping Angel, developed ways to take over a Samsung smart television, making it appear it was off when in fact it was recording conversations in the room. ""You thought your technology was safe. It's never been safe,"" said James Lewis, cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank. The CIA and White House declined comment. ""We do not comment on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents,"" CIA spokesman Jonathan Liu said in a statement. Google declined to comment on the reported hacking of its Android platform, but said it was investigating the matter. Snowden on Twitter said the files amount to the first public evidence that the U.S. government secretly buys software to exploit technology, referring to a table published by WikiLeaks that appeared to list various Apple iOS flaws purchased by the CIA and other intelligence agencies. An Apple Inc <AAPL.O> spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment. The documents refer to means for accessing phones directly in order to catch messages before they are protected by end-to-end encryption tools like Signal. Signal inventor Moxie Marlinspike said he took that as ""confirmation that what we're doing is working."" Signal and the like are ""pushing intelligence agencies from a world of undetectable mass surveillance to a world where they have to use expensive, high-risk, extremely targeted attacks."" CIA CYBER PROGRAMS The CIA in recent years underwent a restructuring to focus more on cyber warfare to keep pace with the increasing digital sophistication of foreign adversaries. The spy agency is prohibited by law from collecting intelligence that details domestic activities of Americans and is generally restricted in how it may gather any U.S. data for counterintelligence purposes. The documents published Tuesday appeared to supply specific details to what has been long-known in the abstract: U.S. intelligence agencies, like their allies and adversaries, are constantly working to discover and exploit flaws in any manner of technology products. Unlike the Snowden leaks, which revealed the NSA was secretly collecting details of telephone calls by ordinary Americans, the new WikiLeaks material did not appear to contain material that would fundamentally change what is publicly known about cyber espionage. WikiLeaks, led by Julian Assange, said its publication of the documents on the hacking tools was the first in a series of releases drawing from a data set that includes several hundred million lines of code and includes the CIA's ""entire hacking capacity."" The documents do not include actual computer code needed to conduct the cyber exploits they describe. WikiLeaks said it published the CIA documents ""while avoiding the distribution of 'armed' cyber weapons until a consensus emerges on the technical and political nature of the CIA's program and how such 'weapons' should be analyzed, disarmed and published."" U.S. intelligence agencies have said that Wikileaks has ties to Russia's security services. During the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, Wikileaks published internal emails of top Democratic Party officials, which the agencies said were hacked by Moscow as part of a coordinated influence campaign to help Donald Trump win the presidency. WikiLeaks has denied ties to Russian spy agencies. U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they did not know where WikiLeaks might have obtained the material. In a press release, the group said, ""The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive."" U.S. intelligence agencies have suffered a series of major security breaches, including Snowden's. In 2010, U.S. military intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning provided more than 700,000 documents, videos, diplomatic cables and battlefield accounts to Wikileaks. President Barack Obama shortened her prison sentence in January. [nL1N1F7202] Last month, former NSA contractor Harold Thomas Martin was indicted on charges of taking highly sensitive government materials over a course of 20 years, storing the trove of secrets in his home. [nL1N1FT1WA] A longtime intelligence contractor with expertise in U.S. hacking tools said that people in the CIA and the NSA were ""furious"" about the apparent new breach. ""This is not a Snowden-type situation,"" he said. ""This was taken over a long term and handed over to WikiLeaks.""

Hillhouse Capital, IDG Capital, Sequoia Capital, and Baidu all purchased the newly issued convertible bonds, and Baidu disclosed that it had invested $300 million.

iQiyi is the largest video streaming site in China, but it currently faces tough competition from Tencent (NASDAQOTH: TCEHY) Video and Alibaba 's Youku Tudou. iQiyi has been losing money since Baidu purchased a majority stake in 2012, which has repeatedly sparked calls for Baidu to sell or spin-off the company to boost its profitability.

Last December, the Wall Street Journal reported that Baidu was planning to spin off iQiyi in an IPO which could raise $1 billion. Baidu denied those rumors, and CEO Robin Li reiterated after the recent bond offering that the site was ""a great asset and an important part of the Baidu ecosystem."" Let's take a closer look at iQiyi, and why Baidu prefers to raise capital through convertible bonds rather than spin off the company in an IPO.

A brief look at iQiyi's history

Baidu and American private equity firm Providence Equity Partners co-founded iQiyi in 2010. In 2012, Baidu bought out Providence's stake to become the dominant investor. It acquired the popular online video business of PPStream the following year, and launched its own film production division in 2014. That same year, smartphone giant Xiaomi and Shunwei Capital acquired a 10%-15% stake in iQiyi for $300 million.

In 2015, it acquired the online rights to top entertainment shows in China, Taiwan, and South Korea -- including the popular Korean variety show Running Man . In 2016, iQiyi launched in Taiwan, marking its first step outside of mainland China.

During last quarter's conference call , Robin Li stated that iQiyi ""performed very well,"" with ""revenue and subscriber numbers ramping up nicely."" According to iResearch's Dec. 2016 numbers, iQiyi's mobile app remained the top video streaming app in China, with 125 million daily active users and 480 million monthly active users, and streamed 335 billion minutes of monthly content.

iQiyi generates most of its revenue from ads, but it launched a paid service in 2015 that lets subscribers get earlier or exclusive access to blockbuster shows. iQiyi claimed the service reached 20 million subscribers last June, up from 5 million at the end of May 2015.

But profitability is tough

On the conference call, Robin Li stated that Baidu planned to support iQiyi's ""further growth,"" but noted that higher content acquisition costs at the site caused its total content costs to rise from 5.6% of revenues in 2015 to 11% in 2016. That statement raises some concerns when we look at Baidu's operating margins over the past five years.

Source: YCharts

Robin Li still hasn't provided a timeline for iQiyi's bottom line to break even, but CFO Jennifer Li noted that margins were ""improving"", and that they would continue doing so in the future. She also stated that to keep costs under control, Baidu will invest more heavily in original content to ""further strengthen and expand"" its subscription user base.

YouTube faces the same challenges

Making a profit from streaming video is very tough. The platform might generate revenue with ads and subscriptions, but those gains often can't offset the costs of hosting videos on servers and content acquisition costs.

Even Alphabet' s(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) YouTube, the biggest streaming video platform in the world with over a billion users, remains unprofitable due to those pressures. Last October, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki stated that the 12-year-old site was ""still in investment mode,"" and that there was ""no timetable"" for achieving profitability. Like iQiyi, YouTube offers a premium subscription platform, YouTube Red, but the service reportedly only had 1.5 million subscribers at the end of last summer.

Baidu and Alphabet are willing to take losses on iQiyi and YouTube for a simple reason: streaming videos tether more users to their ecosystems. If those viewers use iQiyi they're more likely to use other services -- like Baidu Maps, Search, and Wallet -- instead of services from rivals like Tencent . Both companies can also track watched videos, which gives them more data for targeted ads.

The key takeaway

iQiyi will probably keep losing money for years, but investors shouldn't fret over those losses. The platform brings more users into Baidu's ecosystem, which widens its moat against other companies and ensures that it remains the top internet advertising platform in China. Therefore, investors shouldn't expect Baidu to spin off iQiyi any more than they expect Alphabet to spin off YouTube.

(RTTNews.com) - A group of Google adversaries announced a new formal complaint Tuesday to the European Union's antitrust watchdog over the Alphabet Inc.(GOOGL, GOOG) unit's behavior with its Android mobile-operating service, the Wall Street Journal reported.

The Open Internet Project, whose members include German publishing giants Axel Springer SE and Hubert Burda Media, as well as a handful of French internet companies, said it had filed a new complaint to the EU against Google because the technology giant had ""imposed contractual restraints on manufacturers of Android smartphones and tablets, which make it virtually impossible for them to produce and market Google-free devices.""

The European Commission last April accused Google of using its Android mobile-operating system, which runs more than 80% of the world's smartphones, to strong-arm phone makers and telecom companies into favoring Google's search engine and browser on their devices.

The regulator is moving forward with its decision against Google in the shopping case, according to report citing people familiar with the matter. The EU has asked some complainants whether the information they submitted is nonconfidential and could be shared with Google. This is a sign the commission is preparing to show the company more evidence on which it plans to base its decision.

This video was recorded on March 1, 2016.

Mac Greer: On Tuesday, YouTube introduced YouTube TV. For $35 a month, you get around 40 streaming channels. That includes the major networks -- ESPN, Fox News, MSNBC. David, YouTube is also partnered with local TV stations, so you could get local sports and news. Now, what you do not get is CNN, HBO, AMC, A&E, Comedy Central. So, there are some channels missing there. A lot of competition in this space. I guess the phrase that pays is ""skinny bundle."" There are a lot of skinny bundles with Sling and the like. What do you make of YouTube?

David Kretzmann: I think the two advantages that YouTube has here, potentially, and they say that they are negotiating with other content partners, so hopefully they can get some of those other partners on board onto this package, but, the two things that stick out to me that YouTube can do probably better than anyone else, especially with the current players, they're offering unlimited cloud-based DVR storage. Essentially, you'll be able to record up to nine months of content on YouTube. So, they're leveraging the dominant Google Cloud infrastructure in business that Alphabethas built up over the years. That's something you can't do with Sling TV. With Sling TV, you can only watch it live. You can't record something, you can't set up to record something ahead of time. You either watch it live or you miss it. I think that unlimited cloud-based DVR aspect, that's a really user-friendly aspect that tears into the traditional linear TV model. I think it makes the skinny bundle model, or that online streaming model, much more appealing and attractive for users. The other thing that sticks out to me that YouTube could probably do really well down the road is advertising. You could essentially, what Google could offer advertisers is say, ""We know this individual, they search for these products, they have these Search terms on Google, they have these viewing habits on YouTube."" I think Google could arguably do a better job than anyone else of really personalizing and targeting individual ads to users. So, your live TV ads would be different from Matt's, so to speak. I don't know if that's necessarily the plan right now right off the bat, but I think down the road, that is something that could really play to YouTube's advantage.

Matt Argersinger: It's fascinating to watch the evolution of the TV digital streaming market, whatever you want to call it. But in a way, I almost feel like we're coming full circle. If you think about it, when I learned that YouTube was going to have ESPN, I thought, that's huge, that's very compelling. But then, I say, wait, I still want CNN, I like AMC, I still want HBO. So, I start to think to myself, wait, I'm probably going to need two or three skinny bundles. Plus HBO Now, plus Netflix . Then all of the sudden I'm paying over $100 a month anyway, and then it's like, why don't I just stick with my cable subscription?

Greer: I need a keyboard to go with my iPad.

Argersinger: It's interesting. I think, if you really ask a consumer what they want, they want the true à la carte service. Just give me the 15 channels I want plus HBO and plus Netflix. That's what I want. And I'll pay a fee for that. But the bundling continues, and that's something that cable companies have done successfully for decades now. So, it seems like we're coming full circle with the TV market.

Greers: Guys, this really also seems like kind of a play for the future. Piper Jaffray had a recent report that said 26% of teens watch YouTube every day. As those teens get older, and as they make more and more purchasing decisions, maybe YouTube TV becomes their television.

Argersinger: It's already a tremendous brand. If you think about, amazingly, if you think about the Mount Rushmore of online properties, YouTube is absolutely there right next to Google which acquired, brilliantly, YouTube some 10 years ago now. Amazing.

Kretzmann: Yeah, and the Wall Street Journal just reported that the amount of content viewed on YouTube each day is now a billion hours a day. That's up 10X since 2012. So, the level of engagement that is on YouTube already is staggering. I think this TV offering, I think this is one of the more attractive TV offerings, aside from those properties that aren't included in this initial bundle. But I think with that cloud storage, that makes it very appealing, especially to younger viewers who don't necessarily want to sit down and watch a live show from eight to nine at night. They want to watch it whenever they want. They don't want to watch commercials. So, with that cloud storage, you can watch it when you want, you can skip the commercials. From a user experience perspective, I just think that's far and away above live TV, whether it's through a traditional cable package or online streaming. People just want to watch things on their own terms. I think this skinny bundle offering with YouTube is moving closer to that direction. But like Matt said, it's still not true à la carte. I think, ideally, people would pay $5 for CNN, $10 for ESPN, they'd be able to just pick --

Argersinger: $20 for the NFL games that I want to watch this month.

Kretzmann: Right. And potentially just paying for a game. Maybe I'm not an NFL fan, but I'll pay to watch the Superbowl, or something like that. I think it'll be interesting to see if we move in that direction. I think from a user experience perspective, that's probably what most people would like. But whether or not the cable companies let that happen, they'll certainly be resistant to moving in that direction.

Greer: How about, best thing you have watched recently, as we close?

Argersinger: Let's see ... I watched this show called Travelers on Netflix. I don't know if you've seen it, it's one of those Netflix Original Series. Really well done. It's a slow starter, as a lot of these series are. But by the fourth or fifth episode, I was addicted, and I think my wife and I binged in like three nights. It was good stuff.

Kretzmann: I recently watched Sneaky Pete --

Greer: Solid.

Kretzmann: -- which is one of the most recent Amazon Originals. Also, The People vs OJ Simpson , that was on Netflix, that was great. As someone who was born in 1992, I missed the OJ story, and now I get it, I get why people are obsessed with it. It's a great story.

Argersinger: I can't believe that.

Kretzmann: I'm catching up on my history.

Argersinger: I watched the white Bronco live with my dad.

Greer: Speaking of catching up, I watched Dumb and Dumber for the first time with my kids.

Argersinger: For the first time? Wow.

Greer: Yes, I have never seen it. Father of the year. My eleven year old loved it. As did my eight year old.

Kretzmann: Quality entertainment.

Greer: Yeah, it's high brow. On a slightly more serious note, there's a new HBO show called Crashing , which is really good. I'm two episodes in. The producer is Judd Apatow. It's very well done. Shout out to that.

Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)

Google’s YouTube’s metrics are simply astounding.

YouTube viewers world-wide are now watching more than 1 billion hours of videos a day, a phenomenon fuelled by Google’s aggressive embrace of artificial intelligence to recommend videos. That represents a 10-fold increase since 2012, according to YouTube, when it started building algorithms that analyse user data to give each user personalized video lineups designed to keep them watching longer. Believe it or not, 400 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube each minute, or 65 years of video a day. YouTube benefits from the enormous reach of Google, which handles over 93% of internet searches. Google embeds YouTube videos in search results and pre-installs the YouTube app on its Android software, which is running on over 88% of smartphones.

Surprisingly, since Google parent Alphabet Inc doesn’t break out YouTube’s performance, it is still unclear if YouTube is profitable. Some analysts estimate it took in about $US4 billion in ad revenue in 2014 (YouTube makes most of its money on running ads before videos) and roughly broke even. However, given the subscriber growth since then and assuming Google hasn’t overspent on technology and rights to content, YouTube should underpin the company’s growth going forward. About 2 billion unique users now watch a YouTube video every 90 days, according to industry specialists.

Alphabet is in Macrovue’s Tech Stars Vue and Social Media Vue.

Another Week – More Record Highs

The Dow Jones Industrial Average breached the 21,000 mark for the first time, gaining 183.95, or 0.9%, to close the week at 21,005.71—its fourth straight weekly gain. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 0.7%, to 2383.12, and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.4%, to 5870.75; both have been up for six straight weeks. A more conciliatory and “presidential” speech from Mr. Trump and generally positive economic data from around the globe were the main drivers of last week’s market rally.

Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) IPO

Snap Inc shares surged on their first day of trading Thursday as investors clamoured for shares of the biggest technology initial public offering (IPO) in the U.S. since Alibaba Group (BABA:NYSE) made its debut in 2014. Shares of Snap opened at $24, above the IPO price of $17, and recently traded up to US$27.09 on Friday. That’s a 59% gain over the offer price.

The investment case for Snap rests on its vast audience of 158 million daily users (DAUs) in the fourth quarter, concentrated in the coveted 18-to-34-year-old demographic. Snapchat has also won millions of teen users. Certainly the site has attracted advertisers who want to reach that younger audience.

Fundamentally, Snap comes to market with a few “warts”. The company lost more than $500 million as it spent heavily on data storage and marketing and research. Snap must quickly monetize its advertising business in order to support its rich valuation and approach its near term target of $1 billion in revenue. In 2016, the company posted revenue of $404.5 million, up nearly sevenfold compared to 2015-revenue. Not surprisingly, the Wall Street analysts who follow the company have an average target price of US$16.50 or slightly less than the issue price!

The Week Ahead

China Numbers

The Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and National People’s Congress (NPC) meetings will wrap up. Analysts expect the 2017 GDP goal unchanged at +6.5-7%. The fiscal deficit target will likely be raised from 3% in 2016 to 3.5% for 2017. The market expects the inflation target will remain unchanged at 3%, and the money supply (M2) growth target will be lowered to 12% (vs. 13% last year). There are also a few February economic numbers to be released in China (including FX reserves morning of Tuesday 7th March, imports/exports Wednesday 8th March, and CPI/PPI morning of Thursday 9th March).

European Central Bank Meeting

The ECB meeting on Thursday 9th March should be relatively uneventful, with officials likely to push back further against rising expectations for a tightening in policy.

US Numbers

In the US, the February jobs report released on Friday 10th March will be the last major economic data point before the 15th March Federal Open Market Committee decision. Certainly the jobs report could prove pivotal for the Fed as it decides whether to hike rates on 15th March or later. Economists are modelling total job adds of ~175K (vs. 227K in Jan). For what it’s worth, Federal-funds futures contracts say there’s a 94% probability that the central bank will lift its key interest rate target by 25 basis points (one-quarter of a percentage point), to 0.75% to 1%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That's because the intended beneficiary, Google Fiber, has backed out of plans to serve the Portland area.

The proposed reversal has drawn pushback from other tech and telecom companies that say they invested in their Oregon networks in anticipation of the same tax discount the state offered to Google. A repeal now would qualify as bait-and-switch, they complain.

""In our opinion this represents nothing other than bad faith on the part of the Legislature,"" said Brant Wolf, vice president of the Oregon Telecommunications Association, at a hearing of the House Revenue Committee late last month.

The issue originates in 2015, when the state Legislature approved a bill exempting internet service providers from an unusual Oregon property tax - provided those companies offer online connections of roughly 1 gigabit per second. Lawmakers had acted at the behest of Google Fiber, which said it would not offer service in Portland if it were subject to the tax.

Last year, though, Google Fiber scuttled those plans. The company apparently decided that stringing high-speed fiber-optic cables through neighborhoods was too expensive. So Google is exploring wireless service instead in several parts of the country - though apparently not in Portland.

Meanwhile, Comcast and Frontier Communications each applied to take advantage of Oregon's tax break - based on very limited gigabit offerings. Neither won approval from the Department of Revenue, but Comcast is challenging the ruling and will soon roll out a new gigabit service that would almost certainly qualify. Frontier says it will file for the tax exemption in November.

So lawmakers are rethinking their approach. House Bill 2770 would repeal the 2015 gigabit tax break outright, while House Bill 2063 would set a minimum investment threshold to establish eligibility for the tax break, and a maximum price for the internet service. (Lawmakers have not yet suggested dollar amounts.)

The city of Portland, which campaigned for the tax break in 2015, now says it wants it repealed. Portland says advancing technology has brought down the cost of deploying high-speed internet service to the point where a tax break is no longer needed to finance it.

Wendy Johnson, from the League of Oregon Cities, testified recently before a House committee that internet service providers are adding gigabit service in Oregon and other states without the benefit of any new tax breaks.

""Companies are expanding already,"" Johnson testified. ""It's just not the service that we anticipated this exemption was needed for.""

The exemption applies to the unusual way Oregon assesses the value of cable TV and internet networks. Known as ""central assessment,"" the practice taxes companies' intangible assets, such as the value of their brands.

Oregon local governments want to hold onto tax revenue worth several million dollars a year. But telecom companies say they planned their investments in anticipation of saving that money.

Frontier spent $2 million on upgrades in Washington County in anticipation of the tax break according to Wolf, from the telecom association. Taking away the tax break now, he said, would have a ""chilling effect on any future investment they might choose to make in this state.""

The gigabit tax break has been fraught from the beginning. Google Fiber said language in the original legislation accidently excluded the company, prompting lawmakers to write a new bill. Then last year, legislators said they were appalled to see Comcast and Frontier applying for the tax break without evidence of additional investment in their Oregon networks.

At a hearing last month, Oregon Rep. Rob Nosse, D-Portland, claimed he was unaware of the gigabit tax break when he joined the rest of the Legislature in voting for it in 2015.

""I've got to be honest with you,"" Nosse said during the Revenue Committee hearing. ""I don't remember this gigabyte exemption in the bill, actually. If I'd been paying slightly better attention I might have voted differently on it, actually.""

House Revenue Committee Chairman Rep. Phil Barnhart told last month's hearing that he's unpersuaded by telecom companies' testimony that they need the tax breaks to keep investing in Oregon.

""The issue here is the richness of the tax break and the need for it,"" said Barnhart, D-Springfield. ""I expect all businesses who have enjoyed a tax break of any kind to claim it's valuable and necessary. What we need, though, is data that establishes that and so far we haven't received any.""

Update: This article has been updated to clarify that while the Department of Revenue rejected Comcast and Frontier's applications for the tax exemption, each company still hopes to receive the tax break. Comcast is challenging its denial and Frontier hopes to win sign-off from Revenue this fall.

The Komodo dragon lumbered into the spotlight Monday as Google honored the giant lizards that dwell on volcanic islands in Indonesia's Komodo National Park.

About 5,700 of the lizards live at the park, which opened in 1980 and spreads across three key islands north of Australia.

The largest lizards on the planet, the Komodo dragon can weigh more than 300 pounds and stretch up to 10 feet. Its massive size is linked to a phenomena called island gigantism, ios 9 notes, in which island-bound animals evolve into behemoths. Komodo dragons are 100 times bigger than the smallest lizards, Google notes.

They feast on Timor deer, their primary food source on the islands, and can sprint up to 12 mph in pursuit of prey. Their venomous bite allows them them to attack victims and then slowly track them, National Geographic reported, devouring wounded creatures once they weaken and die.

Komodo dragons can eat over half their own body weight in one meal, as Google notes, and have been known to bite people using their replaceable teeth.

The Komodo dragon is currently classified as ""vulnerable"" by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, meaning it's ""at high risk of extinction in the wild.""

This unique little company's stock jumped 62.7% in 2016, handily beating larger peers like 3M (NYSE: MMM) , as well as the S&P 500. But companies that defy description can sometimes be hidden buys.

If it's tough to describe Raven, it's even tougher to figure out where the company -- not to mention its stock -- is likely to head in 2017. That's partly due to a huge issue with the company that should worry investors who are interested in buying top-quality stocks.

Raven Industries invented the modern hot air balloon. Image source: Getty Images.

What it does

Raven Industries was formed in 1956, when a group of businessmen left General Mills , of all places, to form an industrial balloon company. Over the next few decades, Raven invented the modern hot air balloon and dabbled in other materials science industries like fiberglass tanks, parachutes, cold-weather sportswear, and utility truck bodies. The company branched out into the businesses of flow systems and agricultural control systems in the 80s and 90s.

Today, Raven still manufactures balloons, covers, liners, and films used in various applications from grain covers to wastewater pit liners to industrial packaging. It also has robust agricultural controls and radar technologies businesses. The ""internet balloons"" developed by Alphabet 's Google to bring broadband access to rural areas utilize Raven's balloon technology.

Even with its 2016 performance, Raven is still a small company, with a less than $1 billion market cap. So, let's look at how such a small-yet-diversified company managed to crush the market last year.

The Trump factor

As you might expect with a small-cap company, Raven's growth was very lumpy throughout 2016, in sharp contrast to the much larger 3M and the S&P:

RAVN data by YCharts .

But as you can see, one of the biggest jumps of the year for the company came, unsurprisingly, in the wake of Donald Trump's upset win in the November election. Such a win was seen as a boon for construction companies because of a potential major infrastructure package, for defense contractors because of potential increases in military spending, and for energy companies because of the potential removal of environmental regulations.

Raven Industries operates in all of those fields, manufacturing films for the construction industry, surveillance balloons and equipment for the military, and films to contain fracking waste. No wonder the market has high hopes for the company going into 2017.

Of course, considering the amount of opposition on Capitol Hill to some of President Trump's policies and proposals, it would be a risky bet to buy Raven's stock solely on speculation about his agenda without more details about how it might be implemented -- and whether Congress is buying in to his proposals. But there's an even bigger risk for potential Raven investors.

The red flag

Raven is in an unusual situation in that, as of early February, it was in non-compliance with NASDAQ rules for failure to submit quarterly reports to the SEC. Since then, the company has filed five quarterly SEC reports, including amended Q3 2016 and full-year 2016 reports, as well as an amended Q1 2017 report and Q2 and Q3 reports.

The company hadn't held an earnings conference call since March 2016, but it finally held one on February 16th. On that call, as you can imagine, there was a heaping helping of humble pie served up by CEO Dan Rhykus. ""I'd like to address our reevaluation of our internal control framework and the controlled deficiencies we identified,"" he began, before stating the following:

We are responding with the utmost urgency and diligence to remedy the situation and to ensure that we maintain a more proactive approach to adapting the changes in the future, so that our framework design appropriate adapts to whatever changes our business may experience in the future or to changes in the regulatory environment. As we work to remediate these material weaknesses and enhance our control's framework, we will keep you fully informed and updated.

Essentially, management discovered that ""The Company's controls relating to the response to the risks of material misstatement were not effectively designed,"" according to the company's amended 2016 10-K. Specifically, these control issues could -- and did -- lead the company to misstate items including goodwill, long-lived assets, income taxes, and inventories on its quarterly and annual reports.

While many of these misstatements were comparatively small -- selling, general, and administrative expenses, for example, were revised upwards by just $20,000 for FY 2016 -- some were far more significant. Long-lived asset impairment losses of $3.8 million, for example, weren't even included in the original 2016 10-K, and contributed to a $6.7 million drop in EBIT on the amended report. That in turn helped to drop annual EPS from $0.23 (original) to $0.13 (restated), a major change.

What's of more concern than these identified issues, however, is the possibility that there are other problems that haven't yet come to light.

Investor takeaway

There's certainly a case to be made that -- with its reporting now up-to-date and with remediation efforts under way -- Raven's troubles are behind it, and it's a safe investment moving forward. Plus, the company's reported third-quarter earnings were actually pretty impressive . Operating income was up 175% year over year, for example. So maybe I'm being overly cautious when I say that I don't feel comfortable investing in Raven until it can provide concrete assurances that it has its house in order (remember, the company hasn't yet been able to guarantee the issues are solved).

In the third-quarter earnings call, Rhykus has promised to keep investors updated, so I'll be eagerly awaiting those updates. In the meantime, there are plenty of other companies that are generating strong earnings that don't seem to be having the internal problems that Raven is having. If you're interested in materials science stocks, you could consider 3M, despite its middling outlook . For now, though, cautious investors should probably look elsewhere.

UPDATE 1-Investor group seeks to bar Snap from indexes over voting rights



(Adds details on disclosure changes by Snap) By Ross KerberBOSTON, March 6 (Reuters) - A group representing large institutional investors has approached index providers S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI Inc, looking to bar Snap Inc <SNAP.N> and any other company that sells investors non-voting shares from their stock benchmarks. Both index providers have said they are reviewing Snap's inclusion. Were Snap to be added to indexes such as the S&P 500 Index or the MSCI USA Index, managers of stock index portfolios would have to buy its shares, and other investors whose performance is tracked against such indexes would likely follow suit. Some money managers worry about buying Snap's Class A shares because they have no voting rights, meaning those shareholders will have no voice on matters like company strategy or executive pay. ""They're tapping public markets but giving public shareholders no say,"" said Amy Borrus, deputy director of the Council of Institutional Investors, which represents pension funds and other large asset owners, in an interview. In reaching out to both index providers, she said, ""What we would like to see at the least is for the indexes to exclude new no-vote companies."" Meetings with both index providers are scheduled this week, she said. David Blitzer, managing director of S&P Dow Jones Indices and chair of a committee overseeing its indexes, said they would not add a new stock like Snap for six to 12 months after its IPO in any case, and will use that time to study Snap's structure. While the index provider does not have a hard requirement about a company's voting structure, the committee needs to think through how much influence investors should have, Blitzer said in an interview on Monday. "" 'Who Votes?' is the issue right now,"" he said. MSCI <MSCI.N> said on March 2 that Snap would qualify for indexes including the MSCI USA Index, but said on March 3 that after additional analysis Snap did not meet all requirements. Snap's inclusion into the MSCI USA Index will be re-assessed in May, MSCI said in a statement on its website. MSCI is seeking feedback from investors about whether companies without voting rights should be included in indexes, according to the March 3 statement. A spokesman did not immediately provide further details. A spokesman for Snap declined to comment. Snap's $3.4 billion initial public offering last week marked the hottest technology IPO in three years. Investors snapped up shares of the Venice, California company, even though its two co-founders retained near total control. The situation alarms some big investors who fear other companies might copy Snap's structure. Other S&P 500 companies like Facebook <FB.O> and Google parent Alphabet <GOOG.O> also have non-voting shares but still grant voting rights with other widely traded shares. After the council raised concerns about Snap's lack of voting rights last month, Snap's chairman Michael Lynton wrote back on Feb. 21 to point out a section of its prospectus stating the voting structure ""prolongs our ability to remain a founder-led company"" and that Snap will have a majority-independent board, including himself. Index inclusion requirements vary. For the S&P 500 a stock typically needs a market capitalization of around $5.5 billion and to have been profitable over the past four quarters, for instance, Blitzer said. Snap's lack of voting rights was outlined in a registration statement Feb 2. The company filed amended versions of the document during the month, ultimately including more notice that investors might receive limited information. The company also specified Class A investors would be invited to attend its annual meeting. Spokespeople for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Snap declined to comment on the reasons for the new language. But the changes resembled those typically added in response to questions by the SEC, said David Berger, an attorney for the Palo Alto, California law firm Wilson Sonsini, who advises companies on corporate governance, via email. The agency often asks for more disclosure on issues it thinks would be important to investors. ""Often at the top of that list is information about the rights of shareholders,"" Berger said. <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Lacking voting rights, Snap IPO to test fund governance talk http://reut.rs/2lOQvCM Snap's shares pop after year's biggest IPO http://reut.rs/2lXBYrR ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> (Reporting by Ross Kerber in Boston.

GoPro Inc (NASDAQ: GPRO ) is a camera company, yet Wall Street experts expected so much more out the GPRO story. They even once labeled it as ""a YouTube killer."" I bet Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) management wasn't too worried then. That exuberance marked the top for GoPro stock.

Source: ETC-USC via Flickr (Modified)

Now, GoPro stock gets a downgrade under $9 per share. I'm sure it's no coincidence that this coincides with the IPO of Snap Inc (NYSE: SNAP ), which had a successful offering last week. Money is probably flocking out of GPRO and into SNAP stock, perhaps to recoup some losses there.

I think the two have little in common. GoPro stock is a play on a line of action cameras known for being rugged and for active outdoorsy people. We see videos of extreme base jumping pros to teens clearing a two-foot hedge in their front yard. So far, SNAP appears to capture more general scenarios.

The hate for GoPro stock should abate eventually. It still has cool products with very few high-profile direct competitors. I don't have a lot of faith in management, but just like in the case of Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR ), I think someone will eventually figure the stock out. But for this morning, GPRO stock is down 7.8% on a downgrade from Goldman Sachs.



Click to Enlarge Based on that logic, I want to risk a little on a speculative trade going long GPRO stock. I could risk $8 to buy the stock, but instead I will use the options markets to risk even less. My thesis relies on GoPro stock eventually becoming attractive to old fans who revalue their re-entry levels.

I do have to note that GPRO is in danger of inviting more technical sellers if it loses these lows. So I will snipe out the entry, perhaps in two tranches.

The Bet: Sell the GPRO Jan 2018 $5/$3 credit put spread. This is a bullish trade for which I collect 50 cents to open per contract. If successful, this trade would yield over 30% on money risked. I need GPRO stock to stay above my sold spread to win.

Yes, it is a gamble to try and catch falling knives, especially one like GPRO. But I need to add a few speculative plays to my portfolio, and this one qualifies. Again, an underlying assumption is that GoPro will eventually survive. But I don't need it to thrive to profit.

Usually, I like to balance my risk by selling upside risk. In this case, however, I won't. GoPro stock has fallen too far, too fast, and I would be selling risk at a severe discount. If GPRO bounced hard, I would face self-inflicted risk against my own thesis.

I could juice my bet by buying upside calls, but I will wait out a few more trading hours to flush out an interim bottom. I don't want to turn this trade into an investment yet, however, since I've already said that I don't have much faith in GPRO management's ability.

I am not required to hold my options trade option through their expiration. I can close them at any time for partial gains or losses.

Americans are changing the way they watch television. More and more customers are showing interest in over-the-top streaming TV services. Over 200,000 people joined AT&T 's(NYSE: T) DirecTVNow in about one month. DISH Network 's(NASDAQ: DISH) Sling TV has over 1 million subscribers. Sony 's(NYSE: SNE) PlayStation Vue is also very popular.

Now YouTube -- a subsidiary of Google, the Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) company -- is throwing its hat in the ring as well. The company recently revealed YouTube TV, a slightly differentiated television service that costs just $35 per month.

Here's what investors need to know about YouTube TV.

YouTube TV's channel lineup. Image source: YouTube

It's missing a lot of traditional cable networks

YouTube focused on signing deals with the big four broadcast companies. As a result, cable-only media companies such as Viacom and Time Warner are missing from the bundle. No CNN, Comedy Central, Cartoon Network, TBS, TNT, or HBO. But it does mean cable networks owned by the big four -- ESPN, FX, USA, E!, and so on -- are all there.

That's kind of the opposite approach of Sling TV. Sling launched without any broadcast networks, inviting subscribers to buy a television antenna to supplement the service.

Importantly, local networks are limited in availability. That's why YouTube TV is launching only in markets where the media companies own the local broadcast affiliate. Sony tried something similar before expanding nationwide with a reduced price for subscribers where live local channels are not available.

Overall, the channel lineup is somewhat lacking compared with competing services at around the same price point. Customers that signed up early for DirecTV Now are receiving 100 channels for $35 per month, and new customers can still receive 60 channels for that price. PlayStation Vue customers can get a similar set of channels for $35 per month, and Sling TV subscribers can get around 50 channels for $40 per month.

The limited geographical reach and channel lineup should reduce the number of subscribers YouTube TV will attract.

YouTube is a veteran at video streaming

Although YouTube TV may lack some of the content available on other platforms at similar price points and the geographic reach of its competition, it has one major advantage. It already owns leading technology in video streaming.

All three of the aforementioned competitors suffered major technical difficulties following their launches. DirecTV Now received a lot of bad press as its servers were overloaded making parts or all of the service unusable. YouTube, on the other hand, already streaming 1 billion hours of video every day.

Consumers may be willing to sacrifice some channels for more reliable service. But YouTube still has to prove that it can deliver where competitors failed.

The bottom line for investors

YouTube TV is a somewhat underwhelming product at launch. With a limited channel lineup and geographic reach, it's unlikely to make any significant impact on YouTube's operations in the near term.

In the long term, however, getting a viable product out there now could lead to a much better product in the future. YouTube is already offering a few differentiating features such as unlimited cloud DVR, AI powered search and personalization (likely backed by YouTube viewer data), and the ability to split the account six ways so different users get different recommendations. If YouTube can get the content deals in place while maintaining competitive pricing, it could be a big winner in the future.

SAN FRANCISCO When Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] was raising venture capital in 2013, it was one of the hottest deals around – and no one was more eager to write a check than Bill Maris and David Krane of Google's venture capital arm.

Not everyone at Google Ventures, since renamed GV, agreed. The firm already had an investment in a competitor, Sidecar, and Uber was demanding what then looked like a sky-high valuation.

Maris and Krane prevailed, and the deal is now regarded as GV’s greatest success. On paper, the firm's initial 2013 investment of $258 million gained about 14 times its value over the next three years to more than $3.5 billion.

But now Alphabet Inc, Google's corporate parent, is suing Uber for theft of trade secrets, alleging that one of the top engineers in its self-driving car program decamped with thousands of confidential files, including designs that helped him start self-driving truck company Otto and then quickly sell it to Uber. Uber denies those claims.

The lawsuit, filed by Alphabet’s self-driving car unit Waymo, has jolted the fast-growing and highly competitive industry that has sprung up around autonomous vehicles and ride services, which are seen as the future of private road transport.

Yet the confrontation was a long time in the making: the complex relationship between the companies was tense from the start, according to people familiar with the situation, and soured further as they increasingly competed with each other.

Now, if the Waymo suit damages Uber, GV's investment in the ride-hailing company stands to go down as a Silicon Valley rarity: a large funding deal undermined by the firm's own investors.

“Whatever Waymo gains, Google Ventures loses,” said Stephen Diamond, associate professor of law at Santa Clara University.

The lawsuit is just one in a series of recent public setbacks for Uber, including allegations of sexual harassment that prompted an internal investigation, a video of Chief Executive Travis Kalanick arguing with an Uber driver that led him to make a public apology, and Uber's admission on Friday that it used a secret tracking tool to avoid authorities.

“We have reviewed Waymo's claims and determined them to be a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor and we look forward to vigorously defending against them in court,"" Uber said in a statement in response to the lawsuit. ""In the meantime, we will continue our hard work to bring self-driving benefits to the world.”

A spokeswoman for GV declined to comment.

DEAL AT ANY COST

Uber was more than just another investment for then-fledgling Google Ventures, which needed a high-profile deal to put it on the map.

Maris and Krane were early Uber fans, but it took about two years for the pair to connect with Kalanick. When Uber investor Benchmark finally brokered a meeting in May 2013, the Google Ventures partners were determined to do a deal at virtually any cost, according to two sources close to the transaction.

With other would-be investors waiting in adjacent conference rooms at Uber’s San Francisco offices, Maris and Krane made their pitch to invest. Kalanick pushed for a higher valuation, without a board seat; Google Ventures pushed back, asking for a board observer seat and a liquidation preference for protection if Uber was sold at a loss, one of the sources said.

They finally came to terms, with a $3.5 billion valuation, and there were signs that a broader alliance could be in the offing. Separately, David Drummond, Google's senior vice president of corporate development, had a social relationship with Kalanick, and he joined the board.

A ride in a self-driving car and a meeting with Google CEO Larry Page, recounted in Brad Stone's recent book ""The Upstarts,"" seemed to bode well for the relationship.

But conflicts emerged immediately. Kalanick, a tough negotiator, wanted a discount on the software tools behind Google Maps, the company's ubiquitous mapping software, according to a person close to the transaction. The best Google Ventures could offer was close contact between Uber and Google’s mapping team, the person said.

Kalanick also wanted Uber to be featured prominently in Google Maps, eventually giving customers a way to hail an Uber ride directly from Maps, and Google agreed, a source close to Uber said. But Uber felt Google dragged its heels on the integration and found the initial rollout disappointing, the source said.

The friction only grew as Uber turned its attention to autonomous driving, an area where Google had already established an early lead. Uber announced its intentions in typically abrupt style in early 2015, poaching 40 faculty and researchers from Carnegie Mellon University to set up a self-driving lab in Pennsylvania.

It bought mapping software firm deCarta and began investing heavily in its own mapping systems. Meanwhile, Google launched an on-demand delivery service, a market Uber is also chasing, and began offering a carpooling service through driving app Waze, which it acquired in 2013. The carpooling feature in particular rankled Uber, a source close to the company said.

""Things escalated from frenemy to now enemy quite quickly,"" said Anand Sanwal, CEO and co-founder of venture capital research firm CB Insights.

The tension bubbled to the surface last August, when Drummond stepped down from Uber’s board.

Uber declined comment on any of its dealings with Google and did not make Kalanick available for an interview.

UNDERMINED BY ITS OWN INVESTORS?

Uber’s aggressive culture was the subject of many conversations at Google Ventures, a source close to the transaction said. Hoping to influence the startup, the venture firm at first encouraged a flow of talent from Google to Uber.

Yet that too ultimately created problems. Anthony Levandowski, a key engineering manager at the self-driving car unit, now called Waymo, began to talk openly about leaving the company as the autonomous vehicle field blossomed, according to Alphabet's lawsuit.

In January 2016, Levandowski and some colleagues quit Alphabet to form the self-driving truck start-up Otto, which Uber acquired later that year for $680 million. Alphabet claims in its lawsuit that Levandowski had been in touch with Uber even before he left Alphabet.

In the lawsuit, Alphabet alleges Levandowski downloaded 14,000 proprietary design documents and used them to create Otto's - and later Uber's - version of a key autonomous vehicle technology called Lidar, which uses light pulses reflected off objects to gauge their position.

Uber and Levandowski deny the allegations.

The high-stakes legal showdown over whether vital information was transferred between the two companies is perhaps the logical conclusion of their opaque relationship.

All along, Uber remained mysterious to its Google Ventures investors. Kalanick was adamant from the start that he would share little information, and try as it might, Google Ventures could not gain better visibility over time, two sources said. If anything, Kalanick grew more tight-lipped as his business matured.

“It was one of the few companies where we sat there and said, 'Hope it goes well,'"" one of the sources said.

But the program isn’t dead yet, as illustrated by the GM6 — a new Android One handset built by Turkish manufacturer General Mobile.

The GM6 looks as generic as you’d expect an Android One handset to, with a sweep of mid-range specs: 5-inch 720p display, 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, MediaTek MT6737T processor, 13-megapixel rear camera and 8-megapixel front camera, and a 3,000 mAh removable battery. It also has fingerprint scanner built into its Samsung-shaped home button — a first for Android One, according to Phandroid. The inclusion of Android 7.0 (including Google Assistant) rounds out the contemporary features. Digital Trends had some hands-on time with the GM6 at MWC and found that performance was great, although the camera app was a little buggy.

You won’t see the GM6 outside of its home country of Turkey, where the price will likely be in the $100 to $200 range (and probably near the higher-end considering the inclusion of a fingerprint sensor). Still, it’s interesting to see Android One’s territory expand to include devices with more advanced features. Is that due to a change in Android One, or simply because these features are becoming more commonplace?

In other Android One news, there are rumors that the program could be coming to the US “before the middle of the year.” If so, those devices will likely look more like the GM6 than the ultra-basic handsets we’ve seen in other countries.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By now, searchers are accustomed to seeing the panel that appears on the right side of the search result page that provides information about entities such as people, places and brands.

Individuals and companies alike are striving to acquire, maintain and monitor a Knowledge Graph listing. At the moment, however, there is no easy way to report on Knowledge Graph performance and changes. In 2016, Google’s John Mueller did mention that links in Knowledge Graph panels would be counted in the Search Analytics report in Google Search Console. However, this still does not give us insight into the algorithmic aspect of Knowledge Graph rankings and changes.

Why monitor your Knowledge Graph result?

So you may be wondering why should you should care about changes to your personal or company Knowledge Graph result. Here are a couple of reasons.

You (or your business) may share a name with another entity, or maybe you’re competing against a generic term. Whoever has the most relevance and highest score within the Knowledge Graph algorithm will rank better, and their Knowledge Graph panel will be the one to appear in search results for an unmodified query.

Here is an example of a basketball player, author and actor ranking for the name, “Isaiah Thomas.” As you can see, each entity has a score and a different classification type.

Not all Knowledge Graph panels are created equal, and Google will add more information to the panel as it discovers information about a person or company.

Monitoring changes to a Knowledge Graph result can help you better understand how Google perceives you or your company. It can also validate certain optimizations you may be doing on your website — for example, using structured data. Also, if Google makes a mistake with your information, which can definitely happen, you will know before it’s too late.

Monitoring your Knowledge Graph entry

In my effort to find a simple solution for tracking Knowledge Graph changes for me and my clients, I found the following solution. It involves using the Google Knowledge Graph API and a tool called VisualPing. By generating an HTTP request for the Knowledge Graph API results and using VisualPing, a tool that monitors web page changes, I can easily track changes within the Knowledge Graph API results. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how to set this up.

1. Set up a Google API Manager account and generate an API Key.

2. Once your API key is generated, visit the Google Knowledge Graph API tool and conduct a search for an entity.

Once the results have loaded, grab the URL under the “Request” section, which outlines the HTTP request URL format. Here is URL for my query:

3. Add the API Key you generated into the request URL.

Original URL: https://kgsearch.googleapis.com/v1/entities:search?query=Tony+Edward&key= {YOUR_API_KEY}

https://kgsearch.googleapis.com/v1/entities:search?query=Tony+Edward&key= Updated URL with API Key: https://kgsearch.googleapis.com/v1/entities:search?query=tony+edward&key= AIzaSyDlqL-acWjyy7UAXZPVOpXw3q1gMiQ8apc

Here is what the updated URL looks like in a browser. As you can see, it loads the Knowledge Graph API results for my query directly on the page. Now that this is set up like a web page, we can easily track changes on it.

4. From here, create a VisualPing account and set up a job to track changes for your API Request URL. The free version of the tool allows you to set up two jobs with limited credits; you can sign up for a pro account to add more jobs.

The tool provides email notifications and screen shots when changes occur. It also outlines the change percentage. I currently have the tool set to check for changes every 24 hours and to notify me for all changes. Here is what the job dashboard looks like.

So there you have it! You can now easily track the following items (and more) within the Knowledge Graph API results:

Social media giant Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) has already had a pretty good year with FB shares gaining nearly 19% over the course of just two months. While March is unlikely to hold any major events for Facebook stock, shares of the advertising firm are worth holding onto as the company still has quite a bit of growth ahead of it.

Source: Via Stock Snap

Since the firm's IPO in 2012, FB stock has appreciated considerably and the company itself has grown exponentially.

Investors who were able to ride out the Facebook stock's initial bumpy ride saw their shares gain steadily from 2013 on. With FB stock currently trading at $136.7 per share, many are wondering if the company will be able to keep growing and delivering such impressive returns.

After all, the firm makes the majority of its money from advertising and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has admitted that the firm has reached its saturation point in terms of ad volume.

The Foundation of FB Stock's Long-Term Potential

So that leaves gaining new users as a way to bring in new revenue. However, Facebook's most recent earnings report showed that daily active users jumped up from 1 billion to 1.23 billion over the past year. How many more users can FB accumulate?

The answer is that Facebook could essentially double that figure - especially considering that the site is the most popular social media service around the globe. If you consider the fact that around half of the world's population has access to the internet, that means FB's target market is around 3.5 billion people. There are still many people who can be roped into the Facebook ecosystem, meaning there are still potential growth avenues for FB stock in the future.

Growing just by sheer numbers isn't the only way for Facebook stock to beef up its bottom line. The company can draw in more advertising dollars as it improves its offerings and increases engagement among the users that it has already obtained. On the bright side, FB has plenty of interesting features in the pipeline for both Instagram and its primary platform that will do just that.

For example, video is one of the areas that offers a lot of potential for Facebook. The firm recently hired Mina Lefevre, who used to lead scripted development at Viacom, Inc. (NASDAQ: VIA , NASDAQ: VIAB ), which is expected to help the company move forward in this space.

FB is likely to develop its video platform significantly in the year to come. Many believe that the company is looking to expand its video offerings to compete with Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) YouTube; and judging by YouTube's advertising success, that would be a boon for Facebook stock.

Beyond video, Facebook has another avenue by which to grow its advertising revenue: messaging. Between WhatsApp and its own Messenger, FB currently owns the two most popular messaging services in the world. What's more, Facebook has done very little so far to monetize those services. This year, we will likely see the company's plans for its messaging services take shape, which will likely provide a catalyst for FB stock.

The Bottom Line on Facebook Stock

Facebook stock is certainly not cheap, but the company hasn't reached its plateau just yet. The company has conquered social media and it has proven that it has staying power, but the question now is whether the firm can continue to grow its ad revenue now that the social media site has reached its limit as far as ad volume.

While there are still some questions as to how FB stock will move forward, the firm has a solid plan for the future and enough growth potential to justify a long position.

As of this writing, Laura Hoy was long FB.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

The company is a market leader in many fields, and would often rather abandon a product category rather than struggle on as a minor competitor to bigger and better rivals.

But even mighty Apple does the occasional swing-and-a-miss routine. And some of Cupertino's whiffs come in vibrant billion-dollar markets.

Apple ranks dead last in the $24 billion file-hosting market

Brand Keys is a branding consultancy firm with more than three decades of expertise-building history under its belt. The firm is best known for its Customer Loyalty Engagement Index (CLEI) rankings, where a proprietary data-collection process builds customer-loyalty ratings in more than 80 specific product categories.

Apple, of course, dominates several of the latest Brand Keys ratings . The iPhone shows up all comers in the smartphone category, no tablet can beat the iPad's consumer loyalty, and MacBooks walks away with the top rating among laptop brands. In something of an upset, Apple Music even takes home the online music segment.

And then there's the file-storage category. There, Apple doesn't just miss the top spot, but falls all the way to the bottom of 13 ranked services.

How bad is that result for Apple?

To be clear, Brand Keys claims that its measurements translate directly into future sales prospects and revenues. According to independent metrics from Markets and Markets , cloud storage is a $24 billion market today -- and expected to reach annual sales of $75 billion in just five years.

In other words, it looks like Apple is leaving a lot of cash on the table. The iCloud file-storage service is not pulling its weight, or moving the needle for Apple. Instead, consumers with a need for off-site file-storage tools prefer free services like Brand Keys' category winner, Sabrecat -- or a plethora of better-known options such as runner-up Dropbox, or third-place finisher Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Drive.

Apple is not only missing a significant market opportunity, but leaving a lot of that cash for Google parent Alphabet to grab instead.

Apple CEO Tim Cook. Image source: Apple.

Why is Apple missing the boat?

Apple's iCloud is, in many ways, very similar to Google Drive and Dropbox. All three services allow users to store nearly any type of file in a centrally managed cloud server, accessible from any networked computer. They all come with small storage limits for a free account, all offer a terabyte of storage for $9.99 per month, and come with various tools for managing your stored files. But Apple does a few things differently.

First and foremost, the easiest way to access iCloud content is via an iPhone, iPad, or MacBook. In fact, signing up for an iCloud account is part of the setup process for all of these systems. Then, the service is integrated into your Apple experience as the destination for system backup files, the default storage location for files created in the iWork office suite, and an option for storing user files in newer versions of the macOS system.

All of this is designed to keep users tightly bound to Apple's multi-device ecosystem. Once you're in, it's not easy to get untangled. Given Apple's massive market reach, especially in the tablet and smartphone segments, this alone should make iCloud a winner. Apple CEO Tim Cook introduced the package as ""a strategy for the next decade"" in 2012.

However, Apple never quite delivered on that grand ambition. iCloud is reportedly ostracized by other working groups within the company, starved of resources, and mostly seen as a necessary evil. Apple is a product company, and iCloud is not a marketable product on its own -- at least not in its current Apple-centric form. So, this odd piece of infrastructure machinery is left out in the cold.

And there goes Apple's ticket to a $24 billion industry that's also on a rapid growth tear.

Google sure is building its Drive product into everything from Gmail to mobile photo storage to storage space for corporate accounts. Dropbox is doing the same, while on the lookout for another buyout bid. And this market should only grow faster as the Internet of Things grows up, requiring acres of cloud-based storage space. These companies treat online file storage as an important business, valuable on its own merits.

Apple doesn't. Hence, the company is holding back on promoting iCloud, developing it further, or building it into other products, when appropriate. Cupertino misses out on a major growth story, with absolutely no loyalty from the customers who do sign up.

All three of the major indices touched-up on their respective 50-day moving averages during trading yesterday to find some support. This is the first time that technicals have had to step in as support since December.

The next two days will determine success or failure, so traders will spend their days trading both sides of the market for the rest of the week to see how this first test of 2017 plays out.

Today’s three big stock charts looks at the price musings of United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE: UPS ), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Amgen, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMGN ) as three stocks that are facing similarly critical tests of their technical standings.

United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS)

The logistics/delivery company has been locked in a trading range since its disappointing earnings report dropped the shares by more than 10%. Now, after several tests of what has turned into critical chart support, UPS shares are testing $104 for support again.

The level ($104) can be tracked back to April and May of 2016 as a significant support level, which is why the traders are keying some buying off it now.

The touch of $104 comes while UPS shares are touching down on oversold readings from the stock’s RSI. This indicates that the flow of selling pressure is likely to ebb and fewer buyers will be needed to change the momentum for the short-term.

A break below $104 will target another 4% to 5% decline in the shares as $100 is the next clear line of support. According to our model, the stock remains in the short- and intermediate-term bearish category given the technical breakdowns and the declining 50-day moving average.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL)

Alphabet shares have snapped lower over the last week and now reside in a technical “rock and hard place” situation.

GOOGL stock sold out of an overbought situation as it hit $875 right through its first level of support drawn by its 50-day moving average at $843. Friday and Monday’s additional selling pressure dropped Alphabet stock to test its 100-day moving average at $825. This is the second time that GOOGL shares have fallen against this trendline for support in as many months.

Traders need to keep an eye on the trend of the 50-day moving average on Alphabet stock as it appears to be transitioning from a bullish ascending pattern to a neutral and potentially bearish declining trend. This will have a negative implication on the price target for GOOGL shares over the short-term outlook.

For now, maintain an eye on $820, which represents the stock’s 100-day moving average. A break below this will see Alphabet move into that short-term bearish pattern with an initial price target of $800.

The tool dubbed ReBreakCaptcha “lets you easily bypass Google’s reCaptcha v2 anywhere on the web,” according to the author of the tool that is only identified as East-Ee Security.

Google rolled out reCaptcha in 2014 to most of its public services in an effort defeat bots and scripts that can speedily register hundreds of free web-service accounts at a time. CAPTCHA stands for Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart. ReCaptcha is Google’s name for its own technology and service that today uses image, audio or text challenges to verify a human is signing into an account.

East-Ee Security’s ReBreakCaptcha method is able to defeat reCaptcha V2 security via a script that uses Google’s own APIs to capture audio challenges as sound files. Then it uses speech-to-text technology to convert audio into text answers that are then inputted as text-based solutions to audio-based challenges used in reCaptcha V2.

To pull this off, first East-Ee Security devised a way to only access audio reCaptcha challenges. That’s not too difficult because every challenge includes a link, in the form of a tiny pair of headphones, that indicates an audio challenge request is available, according to the author.

“Some of you may notice that instead of an audio challenge, sometimes you get a text challenge,” the researcher writes. “To bypass it and get an audio challenge, you simply click the ‘Reload Challenge’ button until you get the correct type.”

Once the audio challenge is presented reCaptcha allows you to either play the audio file from the webpage or download it.

“Let’s download the audio file and send it to Google Speech Recognition API. Before doing so, we will convert it to a ‘wav’ format, which is requested by Google’s Speech Recognition API. Now we have the audio challenge file and are ready to send it to Google Speech Recognition. How can this be done? Using (Google’s own) API,” the author wrote.

Next, the author writes, “We will send the ‘wav’ audio file and the Speech Recognition will send us back the result in a string (e.g. ‘25143’). This result will be the solution to our audio challenge,” East-Ee Security explains.

The author of the post posted a proof of concept script using Python on GitHub. “It utilizes all of the presented stages of the technique for a fully-automated bypass of ReCaptcha v2.”

Neither Google nor East-Ee Security replied to requests for comment.

Threatpost did reach out to a number of software developers that confirmed the proof of concept script worked, but only when their tests were from a public IP address.

This is also not the first time Google’s reCaptcha service has been bypassed. Last year, at Black Hat Asia, security researchers from Columbia University published a paper I’m not a human: Breaking the Google reCAPTCHA (PDF).

That research was based on bypassing the Google reCaptcha V2’s security checks for detecting suspicious browser attributes or behavior. It also based its bypass technique on identifying and predicting images used in reCaptcha. According the paper’s authors, their technique automatically solved 70.78 percent of the image reCaptcha challenges, while requiring only 19 seconds per challenge.

Upcoming services from Hulu and YouTube will only further serve to intensify the competition.

Though it's still early in the game, after looking at what YouTube TV has to offer, it's a good bet that Alphabet's (GOOG) YouTube is likely to come out in front.

At $35 a month for roughly 40 channels, YouTube is competitive on price with DirecTV Now and Sling (Playstation Vue starts at $40 a month for around 55 channels). But its inclusion of the four major broadcast networks and brand cache are what give it a leg up on the other Virtual Multichannel Video Programming Distributor (vMVPDs).

Others include the major broadcast networks -- CBS, NBC, Fox, and ABC -- but YouTube already has more than 1 billion people watching videos on its various platforms, so people already know the brand.

Jefferies analyst Brian Fitzgerald cited this as a big reason why it could beat out the competition for subscribers. ""Given the robust content and service offerings on top of YouTube's massive user base and near-ubiquitous distribution platform, YouTube TV could easily surpass sub levels of competitors,"" Fitzgerald wrote in a note after the announcement.

In addition to the four broadcast networks, YouTube TV is focusing on sports, with a few channels from ESPN and the ability to watch NFL games (thanks to the broadcast networks) on your TV or set-top box (unfortunately not on mobile, due to Verizon's deal with the NFL). Sports is the last bastion holding the cable bundle together, so any focus on sports should be a competitive advantage for YouTube.

It also has great unlimited cloud DVR capabilities at no cost, another bonus for users. For now, YouTube TV doesn't have a deal with HBO like Sling TV or DirecTV Now do, but YouTube said that it's hopeful it can negotiate that down the line. It does, however, have a deal with CBS-owned Showtime.

That said, YouTube TV is far from perfect.

I was saddened to see no deals with Turner properties, like TNT or TBS, which limits the impact it can have on sports fans (no MLB playoff games, fewer NBA games, significantly reduced exposure to NCAA March Madness), so YouTube TV is far from perfect.

(For a full list of channels available on YouTube TV, click here.)

The number of channels is pretty skinny in the initial bundle, compared to its competitors, with Pacific Crest Securities analyst Andy Hargreaves noting ""a larger bundle would have appealed to a much bigger portion of the U.S. population, affording Alphabet an opportunity to be more disruptive and giving it more ad inventory to sell.""

It's also likely not to be a material driver of revenue and earnings, at least at the beginning. For $35 a month for 44 channels, Hargreaves noted that ""initial margins are likely to be low,"" and some analysts have mentioned this could be a loss leader for YouTube/Google.

In the end though, YouTube and Google have treasure troves of ad inventory and ad selling experience that its competitors can't match the scale and scope on.

It has more data on its users than anyone else outside of Facebook (FB), something Hargreaves cited as being a reason it could be ""much more disruptive than other vMVPD offerings to date.""

The skinny bundle space is still nascent and there are a lot of factors that could alter the outcome and winners and losers. But YouTube TV, for all the reasons mentioned above, has as good a shot as any at winning.

It doesn't take a lawyer to know that things don't look good for Uber, but does this spell disaster for the ride-sharing company's self-driving dream? Here's what you need to know.

The not-so-secret dirty details

Now that this is in the rearview mirror, it's clear we should've seen it coming. According to Alphabet, former Waymo employee Anthony Levandowski illegally downloaded 14,000 ""highly confidential and proprietary files"" in December 2015 that detailed the secret software and hardware designs for Waymo's LIDAR system. LIDAR systems are being developed as the ""eyes"" of most companies' attempts at autonomous vehicles, allowing them to ""see"" the world around them via millions of low-power laser beams blasted out every second. In January 2016, Levandowski started his own self-driving company in and, two weeks later , resigned without notice from Waymo. In August 2016, he sold his company to Uber for $680 million.

IMAGE SOURCE: ALPHABET (WAYMO)

Levandowski and Uber might've managed to keep things under the radar, were it not for a LIDAR component vendor (apparently inadvertently) copying Waymo on an email to Uber, in which attached documents bore a ""striking resemblance"" to Waymo's own LIDAR designs.

Alphabet knows a thing or two about computers, and the details of Levandowski's data dig only served to make the alleged act of design theft look even more provable. So what does this mean for Alphabet, Uber, and the future of self-driving car stocks?

Blinded by the smite?

Lawsuits are a norm, not an anomaly, among major corporations. Alphabet itself is under constant legal attack: At the moment, it's facing antitrust inquiries in the European Union, Argentina, India, Brazil, Russia, and South Korea, as well as patent violation and intellectual property claims by the likes of Oracle . As a privately held company, Uber doesn't announce its legal matters in a single spot, but a quick search turns up hundreds of suits.

On issues of intellectual property, in particular, lawsuits can get particularly sticky. If proven guilty, Uber will likely cough up buckets of cash to Alphabet since, in Alphabet's words, Uber has avoided ""incurring the risk, time, and expense of independently developing their own technology."" By Alphabet's calculation, that includes the $680 million valuation of Otto and Uber's entire self-driving program, since they believe it would've otherwise stayed stalled.

That counterfactual claim is hard to prove, and it may also be difficult to disentangle Uber's own recent advances in self-driving technology. It's impossible for Uber staff to forget what they now know, and almost as impossible for them to even determine whether what they know is Alphabet's or Uber's.

A signal for self-driving car stocks

Image source: Getty Images.

More so than anything else, this lawsuit serves as a warning for self-driving car companies and their shareholders. Alphabet, Uber, and others are in a fierce competition to build the best self-driving car out there, and any attempt to cheat will be met with the full force of the law.

But investors shouldn't equate lawsuits with bankruptcy. Rather, they should take a ""buyer beware"" stance and ask whether a given lawsuit is a warning sign of a deeper issue. An intellectual property lawsuit could be an indicator of an overly competitive company culture, a short-term issue, or even a lack of creative talent. Which problem is at the root of the suit could be a better indicator about the ultimate direction of the corporate defendant's stock than the specific legal details. So if you're an investor in autonomous car companies, remember to look out for lawsuits, read into them the right things, and make informed choices as you hunt for the biggest potential winners in this increasingly competitive race.

When it comes to finding growth, the technology sector is often the place most investors go. After all, the sector is just ripe with fast-moving, high revenue generating companies. Over time, investing in tech stocks has resulted in some pretty great gains for investors. After all, given the volatility associated with the technology sector, most investors these days choose to use tech exchange-traded funds to get their fix.

And when it comes to tech ETFs, investors normally choose the Technology SPDR (ETF) (NYSEARCA: XLK ). With more than $16.5 billion dollars in assets and large trading volumes, the XLK has become the top tech ETF.

But it's not the only one out there. There are more than 50 tech ETFs currently out there. Investors just using the XLK for ease of use may be missing the sector's best bets and biggest opportunities.

With that in mind, here are three ignored tech ETFs that are too good to pass up.

Best Tech ETFs to Buy: First Trust DJ Internet Index Fund (ETF) (FDN)

Expenses: 0.54%, or $54 per $10,000 invested

While tech encompass a lot of areas, the internet is where most of the growth is coming from. From e-commerce to social media, the internet continues to change how we function in society.

And that's why the First Trust DJ Internet Index Fund (ETF) (NYSEARCA: FDN ) should feature a prominent place in your portfolio.

FDN tracks the Dow Jones Internet Composite Index, which is essentially a measure of all the large-cap internet-focused firms in the United States. You're getting search/advertising giants like Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ), travel sites like Expedia Inc (NASDAQ: EXPE ) and even online brokers like TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. (NASDAQ: AMTD ). If it operates a website and derives the bulk of its revenues from that site, then FDN has it.

The real benefit of that focus has been FDN's returns.

Since launching in 2008, FDN has had a staggering cumulative return of 344%. That works out to be around 14.08% annually. Moreover, that performance crushes the broader XLK, which only returned about 9% annually in that time.

Add in FDN's low expense ratio of 0.54%, and you have one of the best tech ETFs to buy.

Best Tech ETFs to Buy: iShares Exponential Technologies ETF (XT)

Expenses: 0.47%

The tech sector is always at the forefront of innovation. The problem is, when you're looking into the future, you're not exactly sure what's going to stick. For every cloud computing, there are VR headsets.

To play the upcoming decades right, you could cobble together a stock or two from each hottest trend and see if they make or it. Or you could just buy one of the tech ETFs that bet on "" exponential "" technology.

As the first and oldest fund in the sector, the iShares Exponential Technologies ETF (NYSEARCA: XT ) should be first on your list.

The $900 million ETF , invests in the newest of the new. That includes various technology sub-themes like cloud computing, robotics, bioinformatics, nanotechnology and more. In total, the ETF owns nearly 200 different cutting-edge tech firms. But here's the real beauty, XT isn't just focused on ""tech"" companies. Healthcare, industrial and even consumer discretionary stocks make their way into the ETF. This allows investors to participate across the board of firms offering high-tech solutions in their respective industries.

In the end, XT could be one of the best tech ETFs for long-term investors to own as these cutting-edge ideas take hold.

Best Tech ETFs to Buy: Guggenheim China Technology ETF (CQQQ)

Expenses: 0.70%

What happens when you combine one of the fastest growing sectors in the market with one of the fastest growing nations? You get a recipe for long-term success.

The Guggenheim China Technology ETF (NYSEARCA: CQQQ ) seems like an odd choice in that it tracks 74 Chinese technology stocks. But believe me, this is one of the tech ETFs that should be on your list. China really is a tech powerhouse and it is as much about technology as the U.S.

For starters, the nation boasts one of the largest mobile phone and internet user bases in the world. This has helped it curate a rich ecosystem devoted to online gaming, shopping and entertainment. Ever hear the names Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE: BABA ) or Ctrip.Com International Ltd (ADR) (NASDAQ: CTRP )? Thought so.

Meanwhile, many Chinese hardware brands are becoming staples across the world. Think Lenovo Group Limited (ADR) (OTCMKTS: LNVGY ) for computers or Huawei for smartphones and other gadgets. The nation is a dominant solar panel and semiconductor producer … the list goes on and on.

As a result, CQQQ could be a great long-term play as China emerges and becomes a 'superpower' - one that runs on a hefty dose of tech.

( GOOG ) ( GOOGL ) shares next? Alphabet has been bought aggressively by multiple famous gurus. Buffett and Munger have commented favorably on the company's competitive position several times. The latest Berkshire shareholder letter indicates Buffett is very knowledgeable about the technology space.

The fact that so many value investors are buying Alphabet at current multiples indicate it is a great business at a fair price. It is not immediately obvious how popular the stock is because Alphabet trades an A and a C share class, which are treated as seperate companies by lists put together through automation. They are economically equivalent, however, and if you add them up, Alphabet is one of the highest-owned stocks among the great investors tracked by GuruFocus.

Back in 2009, Warren Buffett ( Trades , Portfolio ) talked about IBM ( IBM ), Apple and Google:

""The chances of being way wrong in IBM are probably less, at least for us, than the chances of being way wrong in Google or Apple. I just don't know how to value them. I would not be at all surprised to see them be worth a lot more money 10 years from now but I would not buy either one of them. I sure as hell wouldn't short them either.""

In addition, Charlie Munger (Trades, Portfolio) said:

""Google has a huge new moat. In fact, I've probably never seen such a wide moat.""

Munger added it was also filled with sharks. It is impossible to assess a moat without understanding competitors and their chances to successfully assault a company's market share. In this case, Munger might have seen the potential early while Buffett remained unconvinced. Buffett has alluded to his biggest mistakes as acts of omission.

Bill Gates, former Microsoft ( MSFT ) chairman and a good friend of Buffett, stepped down in 2014. Microsoft runs the only real competition to Google search. Gates stepping down may have freed Buffett to learn about that competitive landscape from him.

In additon, Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin and Chairman Eric Schmidt traveled to Omaha to talk to Buffett when setting up the new Alphabet structure, which is molded after Berkshire.

Shortly before the trip, they brought in CFO Ruth Porat, who understands the tech founders' goals for the company.

Buffett included the following paragraphs in the 2017 shareholder letter, putting my spider senses on red alert:

""In 2002, entrepreneur Mitch Kapor asserted that 'By 2029 no computer - or 'machine intelligence' - will have passed the Turing Test,' which deals with whether a computer can successfully impersonate a human being. Inventor Ray Kurzweil took the opposing view. Each backed up his opinion with $10,000. I don't know who will win this bet, but I will confidently wager that no computer will ever replicate Charlie. That same year, Craig Mundie of Microsoft asserted that pilotless planes would routinely fly passengers by 2030, while Eric Schmidt of Google argued otherwise. The stakes were $1,000 each. To ease any heartburn Eric might be experiencing from his outsized exposure, I recently offered to take a piece of his action. He promptly laid off $500 with me. (I like his assumption that I'll be around in 2030 to contribute my payment, should we lose.)""

This paragraph shows Buffett has been studying the tech world very hard and is open to the possibility the Turing test will be cracked by 2029. He also must have looked into the dynamics of driverless or pilotless technology, note the recent investment into airlines, to take on a $500 bet. I do not think betting against Buffett is generally a profitable endeavour. What jumped out at me is, apparently, Alphabet's chairman and Buffett recently spoke again. They must have spoken for quite some time for the subject of this casual bet to come up.

All these factors have led me to speculate on the potential of an Alphabet investment.

The pieces are falling into place.

Buffett has been studying tech intensely.

Berkshire has made a 180 as far as tech investments go.

Buffett and Munger view Alphabet as having an incredibly strong moat.

Alphabet's valuation is at an attractive level given the interest from the value investing greats. Porat is a great addition to the executive suite ,covering up pre-existing weaknesses in the team.

Google executives have met with Buffett on multiple occasions and Schmidt talked to him recently.

The one thing I could see keeping Buffett from making an investment is his distaste for stock-based compensation. Alphabet continues to dole it out like it is candy on Halloween.

I would go as far as to say it would greatly surprise me if we do not see Berkshire buying a stake in Alphabet in the next five years.

Mosesmann sees AMD’s zen launch as one that is enough to rattle INTC investors, as he explains, “Zen-based Ryzen 7 desktop x86 CPU (available now) has disrupted the desktop PC gaming segment with the value proposition of half the price (of a ~$1K high end 8-core i7 series from Intel […] at better performance (~5%). Fair enough. AMD should gain share in desktops. The angle here is that gamers are likely to use that $500 savings to spend on a better display, or GPU card, or storage solution. An incremental tail wind for GPU spend. BUT the real take-way: The 8-core Ryzen 7 is a 95 watt rated CPU, over 30% more thrifty on energy than Intel’s 8-core i7 6900K. This is an eyebrow-raising event to say the least and likely due to a very efficient design not easily solved by Intel in the near-term (process or architecture-wise).”

“We are in the camp of AMD re-capturing 10% or more of the x86 market in dollars (PC and server) as they did 7-8 years ago,” Mosesmann surmises.

According to TipRanks, which measures analysts’ and bloggers’ success rate based on how their calls perform, five-star analyst Hans Mosesmann is ranked #357 out of 4,503 analysts. Mosesmann has a 54% success rate and realizes 12.3% in his annual returns. However, when suggesting AMD, Mosesmann loses 24.4% in average profits on the stock.

TipRanks analytics demonstrate AMD as a Buy. Out of 22 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 10 are bullish on AMD stock, 10 remain sidelined, and 2 are bearish on the stock. With a loss potential of 25%, the stock’s consensus target price stands at $10.92.

Alphabet Raring to Take on Amazon/Prime and Netflix with New YouTube TV

Alphabet revealed yesterday YouTube is ready to make a serious play into the over-the-top (OTT) content world by entering a highly-anticipated TV subscription offering into the mix. From the eyes of Baird top analyst Colin Sebastian, this move affirms Alphabet is “[…] taking OTT more seriously,” and he commends the undertaking as strategic.

Therefore, as YouTube TV takes careful “aim at offline ad budgets,” the analyst reiterates an Outperform rating on GOOGL with a price target of $960, which represents a 12% increase from where the shares last closed.

Sebastian opines, “YouTube TV announcement suggests Google taking OTT more seriously. While long-rumored, yesterday’s announcement of YouTube TV subscription serve more formally established Google/YouTube as a player in the over-the-top (OTT) content and distribution market, and set to compete more directly with legacy cable/satellite networks as well as pure-play online subscription alternatives (e.g. Amazon/Prime Instant Video, Netflix.) We believe Google/YouTube is well positioned in the market with a large 1 billion+ active user base, significant streaming/download capabilities, and resources to license and create content.”

In fact, the analyst projects this step will not only generate further subscription revenue growth, but the news could also […] accelerate the migration of linear TV ad budgets online.”

Overall, “Investments in original content likely to continue. We believe accelerated investment in owned/licensed and live content (YouTube mobile live streaming rolled out to channels with >10,000 subscribers) will be an important long-term driver of YouTube growth,” concludes Sebastian.

Colin Sebastian has a very good TipRanks score with a high ranking of #17 out of 4,503 analysts and a 78% success rate. Sebastian earns 18.9% in his yearly returns. When recommending GOOGL, Sebastian garners 17.0% in average profits on the stock.

TipRanks analytics exhibit GOOGL as a Strong Buy. Based on 28 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 26 rate a Buy on Alphabet stock, 1 maintains a Hold, while 1 issues a Sell. The 12-month average price target stands at $1,002.00, marking a 17% upside from where the stock is currently trading.

Shares of Mountain View, California-based Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) had a much better start to 2017 after finishing 2016 with just a modest return of 2%. Investors did not bid GOOGL stock higher in 2016 even after the company posted continuous double-digit revenue growth throughout the year. GOOGL stock is already up more than 8% YTD and we believe it is most likely to outperform in 2017. While Alphabet Inc's search and digital advertising businesses continue to be key revenue drivers for the tech behemoth, some latest developments suggest many more key growth drivers for the company going ahead. These new growth drivers suggest GOOGL stock could be headed much higher. Here's Why.

YouTube To Bring In More Ad Dollars Now.

Alphabet Inc's video platform YouTube recently unveiled YouTube TV, its live TV streaming service. The subscription costs $35-a-month for a package of 40-plus channels. However, there are a quite a few holes in the YouTube offering. As it does not include some of the major networks like AMC Networks, Discovery Communications, Time Warner, A+E Networks and Viacom networks and this service is not available in all regions of US, an incremental roll-out is planned. However, this is a step in the right direction. YouTube was the biggest driver of ad revenue growth for Alpahbet Inc in 2016. Alphabet Inc does not disclose the break up of revenue from YouTube alone but Jefferies analysts calculated that it brought in about $12 billion in revenue last year. With YouTube TV now, Google can have a crack at the TV ad market.

Though the advertising details of YouTube TV have not been disclosed, industry experts see YouTube helping Google get a pie of the TV ad market. William Blair‘s Ralph Schackert is very bullish over the long-term about YouTube's latest offering as he points out ""TV advertising is a $185 billion annual market, and pay TV is $275 billion, therefore, both are very attractive markets for YouTube to chip away at over the longer term."" The TV ad market would be extra add dollars YouTube would bring, in addition to the ones it is currently making on its platform. According to the latest data disclosed, people now watch 1 billion hours of YouTube per day. The rise in viewing hours could help it grow revenues at a much faster pace.

Another key point to note here is that with YouTube TV you also get many other value added benefits, one of them being access to YouTube Red, a $10 per month original content service from YouTube. A recent study also suggests original content is helping Google’s YouTube get new subscribers. However crowded the competition Youtube's offering is likely to appeal to a niche audience. If AT&T’s DirecTV Now which was so buggy at launch can manage to ""acquire 200,000 subscribers in its first month, without impacting its rivals’ growth,"" according to Sling TV CEO Roger Lynch, then YouTube is expected to do much better than that. If that happens to be true, then as William Blair‘s Ralph Schackert suggests, YouTube may receive ""a warm reception from TV advertisers"".

Alphabet's Recent Upgrade To AA-plus Corporate Credit Rating Is A Bullish Signal.

Alphabet Inc was recently upgraded to AA-plus corporate credit rating at S&P Global. Alphabet's latest rating is only one rating below Standard & Poor's AAA rating, the scale's highest level. This highest level rating is only exclusively awarded to Microsoft and Johnson & Johnson. This upgrade clearly suggests the strong future outlook of the tech giant. To quote S&P Global analyst David Tsui: ""The ratings upgrade reflects Alphabet’s consistently strong operating performance, despite a challenging and evolving digital advertising market, while it continues to maintain a conservative financial policy and strong liquidity profile."" All this adds to many growth drivers in front of the parent body of the search engine giant Google. Alphabet Inc's next growth cycle could be closer than we think. As a Motley Fool post highlights, Alphabet’s Waymo leads the field in driverless car space and ""could be moving toward monetization sooner than anyone else.""

Summing It Up.

GOOGL stock has made a good start to the year and in a recent research note, Goldman Sachs reiterated their buy rating on shares of Alphabet Inc with a price target of $970.00. This reaffirms the belief that GOOGL stock is headed higher. With YouTube TV, Google may work itself into a position of strength to tap into the massive TV ad market, which could help revenues grow faster than expected. In Waymo, Alphabet Inc may soon find its next big growth driver with the driverless car trend picking up pace. As a The Street post points out with Alphabet trading at a forward multiple of 22, GOOGL stock ""comes at a massive bargain to the internet service and software peer group average of 48 times which is heavily skewed by Amazon's astronomical forward price-to-earnings ratio of 117."" This is after taking into account projected 19% EPS growth of GOOGL stock over the next 5 years. Hence, long-term investors should buy GOOGL stock, and buy more of it on every dip.

This Thursday, the Snap Inc (NYSE: SNAP ) IPO is expected to hit the markets. The current price range on the deal is $14 to $16, which means that the company could raise over $3 billion. It seems like a good bet there will be a nice move on the upside, but you will probably not get any shares at offering price.

Rather, you'll have to take your chances in the aftermarket, which can be dicey. So how should you approach SNAP? Ultimately, it depends on your time frame.

Let's take a look at some potential strategies:

Snapchat IPO: The Long-Term Trade

A lot of investors are wondering: Will this be similar to the opening of Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) or Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR )?

After all, the performances are a stark contrast. FB has logged a gain of 254% since its debut while TWTR has lost a grueling 62%.

Unfortunately, for the Snapchat IPO, I think there is a better chance that the returns will look more like the latter. Why? Snap Inc looks more like a niche operator. The 18-to-34 year-old category is certainly a valuable niche, as many advertisers have a tough time reaching this demographic, but the market opportunity may prove to be relatively small.

According to Pivotal analyst Brian Wieser, the revenues from youth-oriented cable channels like MTV, VH1, Comedy Central and Adult Swim come to roughly $3 billion per year .

Besides, if SNAP is unable to break out of its niche, the company will certainly be challenged in keeping up the growth of its user base. Actually, there has already been a deceleration. It went from 21 million net adds in Q2 of last year to only 5 million by Q4 .

But there are some other issues that could be a problem for long-term holders of Snapchat stock:

The net losses remain significant, coming to $514.6 million in 2016. This compares to revenues of $404.5 million .

The competition continues to get tougher. To this end, FB's Instagram has been essentially matching many of SNAP's core features (and this may help explain the deceleration in the user growth). According to InvestorPlace contributor Chris Lau : ""When FB launched Facebook Stories above the news feed, it took away a reason for millennials to leave the site and use SNAP. Similarly, Instagram Stories usage grew to 150 million daily active users in just five months.""

There are signs that Spectacles, which are glasses that allow you to take photos and videos, may be losing much of their appeal. According to the Wall Street Journal , SNAP recently closed a pop-up store in New York City where ""there were often more employees than shoppers.""

SNAP has a contingent liability of $2 billion . This is what the company must pay - until 2022 - to Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) for cloud services.

(NASDAQ: , NASDAQ: ) for cloud services. Public shareholders will not have the right to vote. This will mean it will be nearly impossible for an activist investor to get any traction if there are problems with SNAP.

There is no headquarters, which could make it tough for allowing collaboration.





Snapchat IPO: The Short-Term Play

While the risk factors mentioned above are downright scary, they probably won't amount to much during the next few months. If anything, the Snapchat IPO is likely to be a great vehicle for traders.

One key reason for this is technical: The amount of shares on the market will be fairly small. This means it will not take much buying power to move Snapchat stock.

Interestingly enough, it looks like the company has been taking steps to keep the float tight. To this end, SNAP is requiring some investors to not sell 50 million of the 200 million shares that will be offered.

Of course, there will be some other factors that will help drive the momentum. Keep in mind that SNAP likely has various deals lined up, which should gin up buzz over time. It also helps that there has been a dearth of IPO activity over the last year. Oh, and of course, the overall equities markets have been in a powerful bull mode, which is always critical for IPOs.

Overall, things are lining up quite nicely for the Snapchat IPO, yet this is probably not a stock to hold on for too long.

By Angela Moon and Tim BaysingerNEW YORK, March 1 (Reuters) - As Snap Inc <SNAP.N> looks to gobble up a larger share of the $82 billion digital U.S. ad market, the owner of the ephemeral messaging app popular with millennials could find itself facing more demands from advertisers for reliable metrics. Snap, like many in the industry, does not have its ad metrics audited by a third party, a step that could help woo media buyers and advertisers and in turn boost revenue for the Snapchat owner, which is aiming to raise more than $3 billion in its initial public offering on Thursday. [nL2N1GD21V] ""I think the biggest challenge with using them (Snap) is measurement,"" said Stacey Stewart, executive vice president at advertising agency Universal McCann. ""Shifting any significant amount of funds or dollars into Snapchat, until we can start to prove out the measurement, is always going to be a challenge."" Snap declined to comment when asked if it had plans for an external audit. At the high end of its expected IPO price range, Snap will have a market value of more than $22 billion even though it lost more than $514 million last year on $404 million in revenue. Snap's business model depends on drastically increasing ad dollars per user. That number sits at $2.15 for North America, where more than half of its users are based, according to Snap's S-1 filing. Facebook's average revenue per user in the U.S. and Canada is $19.81, according to the company's most recent earnings report. Snap's popular mobile video ads start at $10,000 per month, while ads on the Discover feature, reserved for big publishers and brands, start at $50,000 per day. Snap also lets brands buy a 24-hour sponsored lens or geofilters that can cost more than $700,000 for holidays and special events, according to digital marketing firm Wallaroo Media. Snap Ads will account for 68 percent of Snapchat's expected $804 million U.S. ad revenue in 2017, eMarketer estimates. While major advertisers have been eager to experiment with Snap, the measurement issues loom large in persuading advertisers to make big, long-term commitments. The digital ad industry has struggled for years with how to measure whether an ad has actually been seen, and what counts as a ""view"" when many users linger on a video for only a few seconds. Facebook Inc <FB.O> last year admitted to several errors in the way that it counts its advertising audience. In February, the company agreed to an independent audit by the Media Ratings Council, a step long advocated by groups including the Association of National Advertisers. Alphabet's Google <GOOG.O>, the market leader in online video advertising, also agreed last month to have more of its metrics audited by the MRC, including those for YouTube for the first time. NEW METRICS Snap has been introducing its own metrics that highlight engagement, arguing that its users, mostly in the 18-34-year-old demographic coveted by advertisers, spend an average of 25 to 30 minutes on the app and visit it more than 18 times a day. Snap Chief Strategy Officer Imran Khan told potential investors in New York last week that they should focus less on user growth, a typical way of reading the potential of a social network, and more on how active users are on its app. In November, the company began using a newly launched metric by digital analytics firm Moat, called Moat Video Score, which assigns video ads a number between zero and 100 that rates the ad's performance based on how long it is viewed, how long the sound was on and how much space on the screen the ad occupied. Snap stated in its S-1 filing that ""there weren't any standard metrics"" in the industry. ""We see Snapchat as an opportunity, we think that most of our major advertisers are certainly leaning in somewhat to Snapchat,"" said Rob Norman, chief digital officer of ad agency GroupM, the world's largest media-buying firm. But he added that Snap had to show numbers to prove the effectiveness of its advertising. Google and Facebook control about 60 percent of the U.S. digital ad market and their growth has accelerated in recent years, according to data by eMarketer and Interactive Advertising Bureau. Advertisers, at a minimum, welcome that Snap will inject more competition into the market. ""You need that competition to put the onus back on the person selling you a bill of goods,"" said Ian Schafer, founder and chairman of digital ad agency Deep Focus. In January, an ex-Snap employee filed a lawsuit accusing the company of sharing inflated metrics with some investors ahead of its IPO. Snap dismissed the allegations as ""false from top to bottom"" and asked Los Angeles County Superior Court to put the case on hold until a private arbitration proceeding is completed. A hearing on the motion is scheduled for April 17.

Android, from Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), is the dominant mobile operating system. It runs on nearly nine of every 10 mobile phones, worldwide. But that's never really been a primary reason to by GOOGL stock … or at least not directly.

Source: Shutterstock

From an investor standpoint, you would still rather buy Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) because Apple monetizes iOS the way a butcher monetizes a pig. Google, on the other hand, just gives its OS away to OEMs.

That's not to say Google doesn't make any money off Android, though. Simply by offering its search engine and Google Play store through the software, GOOGL rakes in billions of dollars.

But, the Android ecosystem is extremely fragmented. Compared to Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) - which runs its own store and has its own browser and search engine - Google's take is a mere fraction.

What if that changed? Would it mean anything to GOOGL stock holders?

Controlling Android

While Google is not yet charging OEMs to use its software, the company has been quietly trying to gain control of its creation. Management is pushing OEMs to deliver security updates on a monthly basis. This is important, as crooks push malware onto older, unpatched phones.

Google's newest handset, the Pixel, is designed to be as good as an iPhone. Reviews, however, have been mixed. The company is even trying to get back into China through its OEMs (the world's largest market tossed Google back in 2010 over censorship).

Still, Google has its work cut out for itself. Samsung Electronic (OTCMKTS: SSNLF ) dominates the Android market. OEMs and consumers see this fragmentation as an advantage, even though it allows bugs to multiply because they may appear on one device or brand only.

The operating system itself is hopelessly fragmented. Google is only now rolling out its Marshmallow and Nougat versions of Android and still developing the ""O"" version , while many users have devices that still run the KitKat version. My own Android phone runs on Lollipop, (simply because it lacks the storage to run anything newer).

The way Google eventually gets its arms around all of this may be through Andromeda , an operating system for both Android and its laptop Chromebook devices. Unifying software platforms would give Alphabet Inc the kind of power that Microsoft only dreamed of with its Windows operating system.

Bottom Line on GOOGL Stock

If Alphabet were to start monetizing Android, would investors even notice?

Alphabet continues to grow at 20% per year, powered by advertising on its main Search site and YouTube. The company brings approximately 25 cents of every dollar to the net income line, its balance sheet carries almost no debt, and operating cash flow is ridiculous ($36 billion last year alone, more than twice what it achieved just two years prior). In 2016, Alphabet had revenue in excess of $90 billion.

Over the last year, the price of GOOGL stock is up nearly 17%, and the non-voting GOOG shares are up even more. The company's market cap of $577 billion trails only that of Apple. Six months ago, they were nearly level , but that was before Apple's recent run to new highs.

Alphabet Inc CFO Ruth Porat's program of paring non-performing assets and forcing ""other bets"" (like the company's self-driving car unit, now called Waymo) to make it on their own has paid off. Google's investment balances have been growing steadily, along with its asset base.

What's most amazing is how Alphabet continues to underperform. Android is not a major profit center, and Google Cloud is often considered third in the market, behind Amazon and Microsoft. Google was late to the voice party with Google Assistant, which allowed Amazon to get the drop on it. Plus, the hardware line is loaded with ""me too"" products, and GOOGL leads in precisely zero categories.

Still, Porat has performed well in providing discipline to Google executives, but she has not propelled Alphabet to market leadership outside of Search.

If assets such as Android became true profit centers, GOOGL stock would be well on its way to $1,000 per share and becoming the first trillion-dollar company.

Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) isn't exactly a direct competitor to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ), but the former just eclipsed the latter, and seemingly out of nowhere.

Source: Google

One of the worst-kept secrets in the industry has been Apple's determination to get into the TV business. The company has been working for years trying to put together an online TV service, hoping to offer 25 channels for between $30 and $40 monthly. That project seemed to have been put on hold when AAPL and broadcasters couldn't reach an agreement on price.

But Alphabet has just succeeded where Apple failed.

YouTube TV - live TV from over 40 providers including the big networks for $35 per month - is now official.

YouTube TV Takes on Cable

YouTube TV was announced on Tuesday. Launching ""soon"" in the U.S., this is Google's skinny TV bundle for cord cutters. The four major networks are onboard. So is Walt Disney Co's (NYSE: DIS ) ESPN, along with regional sports networks. Google is also including some content from its premium YouTube Red service. All told, there will be over 40 different content providers - not bad for $35 per month.

Subscribers get unlimited cloud DVR storage, search powered by Google's AI, six user accounts (three streams can be active simultaneously) and the ability to watch YouTube TV on a variety of devices including smartphones, tablets, PCs and Google Chromecast.

In other word, this is pretty much what Apple has been struggling to release.

YouTubeTV is Eerily Similar to Apple's Television Plans

Apple has to have been watching Google's YouTube TV announcement with dismay. Its rival beat it to the punch with the streaming TV bundle it had envisioned offering with the Apple TV.

What makes it even more galling is how close YouTube TV is to what AAPL was negotiating.

In May 2015, AAPL and CBS Corporation (NYSE: CBS ) were in talks about a subscription Apple television streaming service, but money was reportedly a sticking point . In December of that year, CBS CEO Les Moonves confirmed to Business Insider that his network had been in talks with Apple, and were close to settling on a monthly price to charge consumers. Moonves was throwing around $35 - exactly the price that YouTube TV is charging.

Apple balked. Apparently Google was waiting in the wings.

Where Does This Leave AAPL and Its TV Strategy?

At this point, Apple's entire television strategy seems to be struggling.

There was hope that the new Apple TV that launched in 2015 would come with a streaming TV bundle. That didn't happen. Now Apple's set-top streamer is suffering from disappointing sales. The box costs twice what Google and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) charge for their streamers, but lacks the 4K support rivals offer.

Last year, AAPL was showing off a new TV app that would serve as a hub for streaming content, tracking use across multiple services and devices. But it failed to get buy-in from Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX ), making its usefulness questionable.

Google's YouTube TV launch is the icing on the cake.

Where Can Apple Go From Here?

Don't expect Apple to give up on its plans, of course.

The signs of a renewed push toward taking over your living room began last month. Apple hired the former head of Amazon's Fire TV to take over as the head of marketing for Apple TV. This move has raised expectations that AAPL will revamp its Apple TV hardware. It also freed up the previous head of Apple TV to help lead Apple's efforts to sign content deals - something he had considerable experience in from his previous role as senior VP of content distribution at Hulu .

While YouTube TV offers a fixed content bundle, AAPL had always pushed for subscribers having an option to choose their own bundle, Moonves says. If the company can accomplish that goal, it still can position an Apple television streaming service as being something unique.

With YouTube TV, Google may have beaten Apple to the punch when it comes to being first of the tech giants to offer a cheap way to cut the cable, but the war is likely just beginning.

As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Yesterday, Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ: AMZN ) vice president of cloud architecture strategy, Adrian Cockcroft, gave a presentation at a tech conference . Of course, he extolled the virtues of his company's cloud platform, called AWS (Amazon Web Services). Meanwhile, the service was experiencing a major outage.

Source: Shutterstock

Granted, the impact on Amazon stock was fairly minor. Yet, investors should still be concerned. Let's face it, AWS is critical for AMZN stock.

Last year, this business segment reported a 56% spike in revenues to $12.2 billion and operating income came to $3.1 billion. There are over 1 million active customers. More importantly, Amazon Web Services essentially subsidizes the core ecommerce business - which has razor-thin margins - but also allows for the heavy investments in efforts like video/music streaming, Alexa and devices like the Kindle.

As for the AWS outage, it lasted roughly four hours and resulted in the disruption of thousands of websites and cloud apps across the US. Some of the high-profile companies that were impacted included Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR ) and Twilio Inc (NYSE: TWLO ).

At the heart of this was the failure of the S3 system, which provides for the efficient storage of content. The irony is that AMZN could not even access its own dashboard to deal with the problems - since it was also hosted on the AWS platform!

The Real Impact?

It is important to keep the outage in perspective. For the most part, Amazon Web Services has a great track record, with uptime that is over 99%. As a result, whenever there is a major outage, there is quite a bit of buzz.

Besides, AWS is a standout offering. Over the years, AMZN has added great features - such as for data analytics, AI (artificial intelligence) and improved security functions - and has also been diligent with lowering pricing. Yet, this does not mean the outage is trivial. It's reasonable to assume that there are many companies that are evaluating the situation. After all, should there be more usage of alternative systems?

Well, I think so. Note that other internet giants are leveraging their own systems to provide cloud services, as seen with Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ). Google is even the main vendor for the fast-growing Snap Inc (NYSE: SNAP ), which has signed a $2 billion contract .

Oh, and many old-line tech operators have been investing heavily in their cloud systems. Just some include International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM ), Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL ), Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (NYSE: HPE ) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ). All these companies have key advantages like trusted brands, global infrastructures and massive customer bases.

Interestingly enough, these companies also have something else: They provide hybrid solutions, such as a blend of cloud services and on-premise technologies. This means a customer can place their mission-critical systems on private servers, which would mean no disruption if there was an outage of AWS.

Bottom Line for AMZN Stock

OK then, with the outage of AWS, there should still not necessarily panic. The market opportunity for the cloud is massive - with plenty of room for multiple players. What's more, the financial costs for the outage will probably be immaterial. According to Global Equities' Trip Chowdhry, he thinks that there could be a 2% drop in revenues for the first quarter .

If there are a couple more outages, however, then the situation could get dicey. When it comes to cloud hosting, there aren't too many second chances.

The term, coined by Warren Buffett, is a flowery way of describing a competitive advantage, which will protect the company's profits and market share (the castle) from competing businesses.

Snap (NYSE: SNAP) , by its own admission, doesn't have a moat.

""In a world where anyone can distribute products instantly and provide them for free, the best way to compete is by innovating to create the most engaging products. That's because it's difficult to use distribution or cost as a competitive advantage -- new software is available to users immediately, and for free,"" management wrote in the company's S-1 filing.

In other words, Snap believes the only way to compete in its market is to out-innovate its competitors like Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) and Google, the Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary. But what we've already seen is that simply being innovative isn't enough if a larger competitor can just copy the innovation.

Image source: Snap.

Snap's ""innovation"" budget is significantly smaller than competitors'

Snap spent $184 million on research and development (R&D) last year. That's nothing compared to Alphabet, Facebook, or even Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) . Keep in mind, Twitter is reducing its R&D expenditure.

Company 2016 R&D Expense R&D as a Percentage of Revenue Snap $0.18 billion 45.4% Alphabet $13.95 billion 15.5% Facebook $5.92 billion 21.4% Twitter $0.71 billion 28.2%

Data source: SEC filings and company quarterly reports.

To be sure, as a percentage of revenue, Snap reinvested much more than any of its competitors. But it's unlikely Snap will continue investing that high of a percentage of revenue into R&D. It simply can't afford to if it wants to show investors that it has any potential at all of becoming profitable at some point.

Snap's cost of revenue is its biggest expense, and it already committed to spending $3 billion on cloud infrastructure over the next five years .

Snap doesn't have the resources to out-innovate its competition, even if it's significantly more focused than any of them.

Even if it does out-innovate...

Snapchat is certainly an innovative app. It's changed the way people communicate, and it quickly grew very popular. Growth has slowed in recent months, however, as its competitors -- specifically Facebook -- have attempted to copy some of its core functionality.

Facebook has been trying to copy Snapchat ever since it tried to buy the company way back in 2013. While several attempts were unsuccessful, Facebook kept at it until it found a winner. Its recent success with Instagram Stories demonstrates the risk Snapchat explains in its S-1. It must keep innovating to stay ahead of competitors copying its product.

But where Snap claims ""it's difficult to use distribution [...] as a competitive advantage,"" Facebook is showing exactly the opposite. It's developed a huge competitive advantage because it has a launching pad for new products like Instagram Stories or Facebook Live. The company went from nearly 0 to 100 million hours of video views per day in just over a year and a half.

To say distribution isn't a competitive advantage ignores a significant part of the value of Facebook's massive audience. While not everything it launches succeeds, the odds are stacked in Facebook's favor. That's evident from the success of Instagram Stories and other product features Facebook blatantly borrowed from competitors like Twitter, such as live video and trending topics.

Distribution isn't a competitive advantage for Snap (at least relative to giants like Facebook and Google), but that doesn't mean it's not a competitive advantage for Facebook or Google. That fact makes Snap's admitted lack of a moat even more of a risk for investors.

From an investor standpoint, you would still rather buy Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) because Apple monetizes iOS the way a butcher monetizes a pig. Google, on the other hand, just gives its OS away to OEMs.

That’s not to say Google doesn’t make any money off Android, though. Simply by offering its search engine and Google Play store through the software, GOOGL rakes in billions of dollars.

But, the Android ecosystem is extremely fragmented. Compared to Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) — which runs its own store and has its own browser and search engine — Google’s take is a mere fraction.

What if that changed? Would it mean anything to GOOGL stock holders?

Controlling Android

While Google is not yet charging OEMs to use its software, the company has been quietly trying to gain control of its creation. Management is pushing OEMs to deliver security updates on a monthly basis. This is important, as crooks push malware onto older, unpatched phones.

Google’s newest handset, the Pixel, is designed to be as good as an iPhone. Reviews, however, have been mixed. The company is even trying to get back into China through its OEMs (the world’s largest market tossed Google back in 2010 over censorship).

Still, Google has its work cut out for itself. Samsung Electronic (OTCMKTS: SSNLF ) dominates the Android market. OEMs and consumers see this fragmentation as an advantage, even though it allows bugs to multiply because they may appear on one device or brand only.

The operating system itself is hopelessly fragmented. Google is only now rolling out its Marshmallow and Nougat versions of Android and still developing the “O” version, while many users have devices that still run the KitKat version. My own Android phone runs on Lollipop, (simply because it lacks the storage to run anything newer).

The way Google eventually gets its arms around all of this may be through Andromeda, an operating system for both Android and its laptop Chromebook devices. Unifying software platforms would give Alphabet Inc the kind of power that Microsoft only dreamed of with its Windows operating system.

Bottom Line on GOOGL Stock

If Alphabet were to start monetizing Android, would investors even notice?

Alphabet continues to grow at 20% per year, powered by advertising on its main Search site and YouTube. The company brings approximately 25 cents of every dollar to the net income line, its balance sheet carries almost no debt, and operating cash flow is ridiculous ($36 billion last year alone, more than twice what it achieved just two years prior). In 2016, Alphabet had revenue in excess of $90 billion.

Fortunately, improvements in translation technology have surged in recent months with the release of deep-learning software, which reinvents the way machines translate. The new tech, called neural machine translation, analyzes the whole sentence rather than word by word. That has greatly improved translations between languages with differing grammar structures, and allows the machine to better pick up nuanced expressions.

But for some Asian languages, Google Translate is still falling short. That could be from a lack of data as countries like China, Korea and Japan favor their own search engines, maps and other localized tech over the Google dynasty.

Line messenger’s former parent company Naver hopes it can dominate NMT in Asia before Google gets there. Its increasingly popular new app Papago, garnering 2 million downloads while still in beta, specializes in direct translations between Korean, Chinese, Japanese and English. Like Google Translate in the Chrome browser, it will embed Papago into its upcoming browser Whale to live-translate websites without leaving the page. And when it gets good enough, why not pop it into the Line app with 1 billion users worldwide?

Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves. After a few trial runs, it turns out that Papago and Google Translate are equally lame, especially when it comes to idioms.

Exhibit A: Piece of cake

On Google Translate, the Korean phrase that means “a very easy thing to do” translates correctly into the English equivalent. Easy enough. Literally, though:

“That thing is one cake piece,” it translates into Korean.

Strangely enough, Papago correctly translates the English phrase into a Korean equivalent (“I can do that easily”), but can’t fathom how to translate the Korean equivalent -- leaving us with the sad transliteration.

Exhibit B: Fat, rich and confused

So goes the Chinese saying “nine out of 10 fat people are rich,” alluding to the gluttony that wealth yields.

From Chinese to Korean, it translates as “10 fat people become rich,” while the translation to English is equally awkward.

Google Translate, likewise, has a long way to go:

Chinese to Korean yields the nonsensical “ten, nine abundant fats,” while English is, at least, straightforward:

On the bright side, Google translates correctly back into the idiom’s original language:

Papago makes some stuff up, declaring ""From 19 fat people rich"" in Chinese.

Exhibit C: Soy sauce factory

Getting into tongue twisters that screw up the best of us, every Korean learner comes across this monster, pronounced “kanjang kongjangjangeun kang kongjangjangigo, doenjang kongjangjangeun jang kongjangjangida.” Go for it.

It means: The factory manager of the soy sauce plant is factory manager Kang, and the factory manager of the soybean plant is factory manager Jang.

Google Translate starts off well, but gets confused with Kang’s name (also the word for river) before crashing and burning at the end.

Meanwhile, Papago may have heard this one before, but still stumbles:

Humans, don’t quit yet

While translation tech is catching up fast, it's not ready to put humans out of business--yet. At a human-versus-AI translation tournament in Seoul last week, humans dominated the competition. That was some short-lived relief for South Korea, which hosted the human-versus-machine Go contest last year that put our mortal species to shame.

On top of Google Translate and Papago, another Korean software company Hancom, which makes a word processor, recently launched its NMT app ""Genie Talk"" that translates between popular Asian languages, plus English, French, Spanish, German, Russian and Arabic. Flitto, a Korean-made translation network app popular in Southeast Asia, launched a free real-time text translation service, which suggests related phrases based on its data from five years of translation requests.

For now, human-translated services may still be the fool-proof option. Gengo is a crowdsourced translation service based in Japan, while Linqapp is a language-exchange app in Taipei that started with English and Chinese.

But translation tech experts believe the machine learning developments will snowball and catch up to human abilities in just one or two years.

Google’s infamous “Glass” smart eyeglasses flopped spectacularly, but the Mountain View tech giant isn’t giving up on outfitting the public with wearable camera gear.

The company on Feb. 28 received a patent for a baseball cap with a stills-and-video camera mounted on the brim.

Photos and video could be beamed via social media to a users’ friends and even allow for live interaction with another user, the patent indicated.

The hat’s brim would have a receptacle to hold the removable camera. The potential for users to share photos and videos straight from the device would one-up makers of wearable cameras that store imagery for later uploads, the patent suggested.

“Some cameras are designed to be attached to a helmet or another place on a person’s body for capturing video clips of events,” according to the patent. “These cameras typically record and store video clips of an event, and a person can later move the video clips onto a computer.

“The (Google Hat) camera system is configured to connect, via the wireless communications module and a mobile computing device, to a social networking server.”

But the technology is not just about real-time virtual socializing — the hat-mounted camera could save a user from attack, the patent indicated. It would do so by connecting a Google Hat wearer’s video feed to emergency services during a threatening situation, essentially allowing the user to show or tell a possible assailant that they’re on camera.

“The user can activate an emergency situation indicator and cause the wearable camera system to transmit a video feed to an appropriate emergency handling system, potentially deterring a dangerous person near the user,” the patent said.

Although Google Glass floundered to its death in the mass market over privacy concerns (the firm is still pursuing specialized applications for the technology), the Google Hat and another device patented Feb. 28 suggest the company retains faith in a broad market for wearable cameras.

The just-granted patent for a “camera bracelet” provides little more than drawings, but shows a sleek device with a digital display and what appear to be two camera lenses.

Much patented technology never sees the light of day, so there’s no guarantee the Google Hat or camera bracelet will ever be available for sale. However, the volume of personal data these devices could collect would certainly be a boon for Google, whose use of such information for selling targeted ads is the crux of the business model.

“This event was off the charts” Gary Vaynerchuk was so impressed with TNW Conference 2016 he paused mid-talk to applaud us. FIND OUT WHY

Google engineer Ivan Fratric originally spotted and reported the bug to Microsoft back in November last year, giving the Windows-maker a 90-day deadline to eliminate the error. This week, the security researcher made the flaw public after Microsoft failed to comply with the appointed timeframe.

At present, Fratric remains reluctant to reveal further details about the vulnerability “at least not until [it] is fixed.” He further added that he never expected Microsoft would “miss the deadline,” remarking the report contains “too much info” about the bug “as it is.”

The flaw has to do with the way the browsers handle instructions to format certain elements on some web pages. It currently affects Edge as well as Internet Explorer 11.

Microsoft has since released a statement, claiming it has a “customer commitment to investigate reported security issues and proactively update impacted devices as soon as possible.”

It further added the company is involved in “an ongoing conversation with Google about extending their deadline since the disclosure could potentially put customers at risk” – but it seems this ship has already sailed.

There’s no evidence to suggest the hackers are actively exploiting the vulnerability as of now, according to BBC. However, so far users have reported being able to reproduce the vulnerability Internet Explorer, but not in Edge.

Curiously, Microsoft unexpectedly delayed its February security patch originally scheduled, which was slated to fix another vulnerability uncovered earlier this month.

Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has been crushing its rivals in self-driving cars, according to the latest data from the California Department of Motor Vehicles. Alphabet's driverless car division -- Waymo -- reported the lowest disengagement rate among all the companies testing self-driving cars on California roads last year, meaning there were fewer times when the autonomous driving system had to be shut down.

How things look



The California DMV defines disengagement as either a failure of autonomous technology or the requirement of human intervention to switch off the autonomous mode. A lower disengagement rate indicates that Waymo's driverless cars have become better at driving themselves.

In fact, according to this data, Waymo is not just better than the rest; it is beating its rivals by a huge margin as its cars had a meager disengagement rate of 0.20 per 1,000 autonomous miles. This is down from the 0.80 disengagement rate in 2015. This seems even more impressive in light of the fact that Waymo vehicles covered longer distances than rivals and, as Techcnrunch reports, Waymo's autonomous vehicles and their engineers are set to err on the side of caution when deciding to disengage.

Manufacturer Autonomous miles driven in 2016 Disengagements Disengagement per 1,000 miles BMW 638 1 1.6 Waymo 635,868 124 0.2 Ford 590 3 5.1 Nissan 4,099 28 6.8 Mercedes-Benz 673 183 271.9 Tesla 550 183 332.7

Data Source: California DMV

A low disengagement rate and more miles driven indicate that Alphabet's moonshot self-driving technology is the most successful on California roads. More importantly, the lower disengagement rate has been accomplished mostly in suburban and city driving conditions. Waymo, therefore, seems to be closer than any other company to launching its self-driving project commercially.

This is not surprising as Alphabet (then Google) began working on driverless cars in 2009 and has the first-mover advantage. Since then, its autonomous cars have driven over 2 million miles, with most of the driving taking place on city streets. Additionally, Waymo clocked 1 billion miles on the simulator last year.

The amount of time and effort put in by Alphabet's Waymo into the self-driving car project has placed it way ahead of the curve in autonomous driving. This might eventually turn Waymo's driverless rivals into potential clients if they are unable to replicate the success of its driverless tech.

Waymo's rivals could start using its technology

Waymo calls itself a self-driving technology company, not a car company. It currently uses a Lexus vehicle and a prototype of its own to test its driverless technology, while it is also plans to add 100 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans to the fleet.

Image Source: Waymo

It is less likely that Alphabet will manufacture cars of its own as it seems to have charted out a different go-to-market strategy. In January, Waymo announced that it will start manufacturing sensors used in driverless cars in-house to integrate its hardware and software development. This integration should give Waymo a cost advantage and lead to stronger adoption of its driverless technology.

In fact, Waymo has reduced the cost to build a Lidar sensor -- the most crucial part of a driverless car as it uses lasers to generate maps of the car's surroundings -- by 90%. The price of a Lidar sensor was $75,000 in 2009, but it costs just $7,500 now. The integration of hardware and software under a single roof will allow Waymo to deliver seamless self-driving performance to potential customers as it is developing its sensors in association with machine learning experts.

As automakers can get turnkey self-driving solutions under a single roof, they will start turning to Waymo to power their self-driving cars. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE: FCAU) is the first such example.

In May last year, Fiat Chrysler and Alphabet's Waymo struck a deal to develop 100 self-driving cars based on the Pacifica Hybrid minivan. This was Waymo's first deal with an automaker to supply its driverless technology. Last month, it was reported that both companies are going to double down on their efforts as Alphabet could add another 100 Pacifica Hybrid minivans to the Waymo fleet this year.

A Bloomberg report says Alphabet is in talks with Fiat Chrysler to start a ride-sharing service with the minivans. If that's true, it would indicate that Waymo is finally taking steps to monetize its driverless technology. Honda (NYSE: HMC) , meanwhile, could be Waymo's next partner.

Both companies were in negotiations last December to put Waymo's technology into Honda's vehicles. A partnership could alter Honda's approach to developing its own driverless cars. The Japanese automaker initially wanted to get its self-driving cars onto highways by 2020, but Waymo could help it go a few steps further by adding city and suburban driving capabilities. A Honda press release says:

Honda previously announced its intention to put production vehicles with automated driving capabilities on highways sometime around 2020 related to its goal of a collision-free society. In addition to these on-going efforts, this technical collaboration with Waymo could allow Honda R&D to explore a different technological approach to bring fully self-driving technology to market. These discussions are an initial step that will allow Waymo and Honda R&D to further explore the potential of a broad range of automated driving technologies.

The takeaway

The latest California data clearly indicate that Alphabet's Waymo has a far better driverless technology than any of its rivals. Waymo is using this to its advantage by partnering with automakers and showing them the strengths of its self-driving technology. This strategy of advertising its superiority in this space is a smart one as it can help Waymo win over potential clients, making it a key player in the driverless car supply chain.

Less than five years after the U.S. Justice Department shot down a merger of Sprint Corp (NYSE: S ) and T-Mobile US Inc (NASDAQ: TMUS ) on antitrust grounds, the third- and fourth-largest wireless companies are reportedly eager to give the deal another go. But prospective TMUS stock and S stock investors should sit on the sidelines while the drama plays out.

Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (modified)

Japan's Softbank Group Corp (OTCMKTS: SFTBF ) is reportedly willing to cede its controlling interest in S to Deutsche Telekom AG (ADR) (OTCMKTS: DTEGY ), which controls T-Mobile.

SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son, spent $20.1 billion to buy a controlling stake in Sprint a few years ago. The wireless provider's market cap now tops $36 billion, so it makes sense that the billionaire may be looking for an exit strategy.

What's Going on With Sprint and T-Mobile?

Interestingly, news of the potential deal was leaked during the critical Federal Communications Commission spectrum auction where merger discussions are forbidden, so it remains unclear whether this is a trial balloon.

Of course, the wildcard in this mix is TMUS' colorful CEO John Legere.

Legere certainly deserves credit for shaking up the wireless industry through innovative marketing, such as paying the early termination fees for customers who switch their service before their service contract expires.

He is far from foolish and loves the spotlight, taking delight in needling his rivals, including Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure. It would make sense that Legere would want to run a merged company. If for some reason, Legere wasn't a top dog, he would collect a payday of nearly $65 million if TMUS were sold, according to its latest proxy.

Legere's winning way with words can change the fact that the wireless market is becoming increasingly commoditized as new entrants, including Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA ), Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google and Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ: CHTR ), squeeze margins of incumbents such as T-Mobile, S, AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T ) and Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ ).

Moreover, the move to 5G isn't going to be as easy as older technologies like 3G and 4G because it's far more complex. Experts say 5G is expected to be three times faster than 4G, which is about four times faster than 3G. Experts don't expect 5G to be deployed until 2019 at the earliest and wireless companies are scrambling to grab up all the spectrum they can ahead of time.

Legere would also have his hands full integrating S. While the Overland, Kansas-based company is in better financial shape now than it was in years past, it still loses money. Some analysts have accused Sprint of underinvesting in its network to bolster its bottom line, a claim that the company vehemently denies.

Bottom Line on TMUS Stock and S Stock

While odds of a merger between S stock and TMUS stock actually happening are better than they were a few years ago, let's not forget that the new resident in the White House is no slouch in the unpredictability department either.

President Donald Trump raised a stink over the merger between AT&T and Time Warner Inc (NYSE: TWX ), even though there are no obvious antitrust arguments against it. Who knows what may happen with Sprint and T-Mobile?

Given the uncertainties around the wireless industry and these two companies in particular, I am going to take a pass on shares of both potential merger partners for now. S stock and TMUS stock are trading near their 52-week highs after double-digit gains over the last year, so there is no sense of urgency for investors to make a move now.

I am not keen on VZ and T either given their appetites for high-priced content companies like TWX.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is in the middle of a breakout. While it was a surprise to many, we profited from seeing it coming. Just recently, I wrote several strategies to go long AAPL stock, and they have all paid well and without trouble.

Source: Beni Krausz via Unsplash

Twelve days ago, I wrote about how you can profit from owning AAPL or trading it . This was in addition to last month's $5 profit per contract out of thin air trading Apple stock when it had appeared to be too late .

Today, I want to repeat the success I've had trading AAPL stock long. But this time I am doing it in a smaller account, so I will use credit put spreads instead of selling naked puts.

How to Trade AAPL Stock

The Bet: Sell the AAPL Oct $110/$105 credit put spread. This is a bullish trade for which I collect 55 cents per contract to open. The 20% buffer from current price gives me a 90% theoretical chance of success. If Apple shares stay above $110 per share, the trade will yield 12% on money risk.

Usually I like to balance my trades by selling opposite bearish risk, but in this case I will refrain. I will count on the Warren Buffett effect that long-term AAPL is a hold. Buyers should step in on down weeks and defend the stock for me.

I could sell credit call spreads in the PowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (ETF) (NASDAQ: QQQ ) to create some balance, but I don't feel it's necessary at this time.

Earlier, I noted that I like selling naked puts in sure things like AAPL and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ). So I will offer the trade, but I only do this if I am willing and able to own the stock at the strike sold.

The Alternate: Sell the AAPL Oct $105 put naked. This is a bullish trade for which I collect $1.25 per contract to open. My breakeven point is $103.75 per share. Anything lower would accrue losses for me.

If AAPL stock falls below my sold strike, I would be put the stock at that price even if it's much lower. Therein lies the open-ended risk unlike that of a credit put spread.

I am not required to hold trades through expiration. I can close either of them for partial gains or losses at any time.

The Information reports that those requests couldn't be handled without human agents, and bots built by outside developers ""had issues"" because the ""technology to understand human requests wasn't developed enough.""

So instead of building a large ecosystem of chatbots, Facebook will train Messenger bots to handle ""a narrower set of cases, so users aren't disappointed by the limitations of automation."" Let's see what this strategic shift means for Facebook's AI efforts, and whether or not chatbots will ever become meaningful tools for the social network.

Understanding Facebook's AI strategy

Artificial intelligence plays a vital role in helping Facebook track users and deliver targeted ads. By using AI to scan a user's status updates, photos, videos, check-ins, likes, linked apps, and other data, Facebook generates digital profiles of users which help it deliver targeted ads to their News Feeds. In 2013, Facebook launched the FAIR (Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research) unit to continuously upgrade those AI capabilities.

That's where Messenger comes in. In 2014, Facebook forced users to download the stand-alone Messenger app to keep chatting. That move -- which clearly mirrored Tencent 's(NASDAQOTH: TCEHY) WeChat -- laid the foundations for Messenger to become a ""platform"" which could eventually offer ride hailing, mobile payments, deliveries, games and other services from a single app.

Facebook's Messenger app. Image source: Google Play.

That move would give Facebook an ""OS within an OS"" to counter the iOS App Store and Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google Play. Facebook's next step would be to replace apps with Messenger chatbots, which were introduced last April. If that effort works, it could turn the entire mobile app store model upside down.

The premature rise of the chatbots

In theory, a business chatbot could answer questions, make purchase suggestions, process orders, and send shipping updates to customers. For customers, having ""conversations"" with these bots would feel more natural than scrolling and clicking through a mobile app. Companies could also cut costs by reducing the number of human customer service representatives.

Facebook tethers those bots to Messenger for Business, which provides a live customer service chat channel for a large number of businesses. Businesses can choose to put a human or a chatbot to handle queries on their end. This idea attracted a lot of early adopters -- 30,000 Facebook bots were already active on Messenger as of last September.

But just as Google struggled with low-quality apps over the years, Facebook's ecosystem quickly became bogged down with poorly produced chatbots. Badly made bots could annoy customers and tarnish a company's image -- so the company decided it's a better idea to send the bots back to the drawing board than expand the overall ecosystem.

Facebook should've seen this coming

The limitations of AI-powered bots were already clear when Facebook launched its chatbot APIs last year. For example, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) launched its chatbot Tay on Twitter as an experiment last March. Within 24 hours, Tay started tweeting racist and sexist comments, forcing Microsoft to abruptly pull the plug and issue an apology. Tencent has also struggled to purge spam and scam bots on WeChat since it started letting millions of accounts create their own bots.

Facebook's AI tech also wasn't that impressive prior to the arrival of its chatbots. Its News Feed struggled to discern fake news headlines from real ones, and its Messenger-based virtual assistant M hasn't gained much ground against Google Now or Siri.

Edison Investment analyst Richard Windsor -- who recently called Facebook a ""laggard in AI"" compared to Google -- stated that ""when Facebook tries to automate its systems, things always go wrong."" He also pointed out that while Facebook has hired plenty of AI talent, it simply hasn't been working on AI ""for nearly long enough"" to challenge market leaders like Google.

So what's next for Facebook's AI efforts?

Despite those missteps, Facebook probably won't stop investing in chatbots anytime soon. The company is expected to introduce new AI plans at its F8 conference in April, which will likely include ways to boost the quality, not quantity, of its Messenger bots. It could also introduce more ways to tether bots into other Messenger features -- like payments and games -- to increase the app's appeal as a stand-alone platform.

How many other organizations have ruled the age of the internet quite like Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) or Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) ? We spend countless hours on each site keeping up with friends and binge-watching our favorite shows.

In fact, with the addition of Alphabet and Amazon , I think we'd be hard-pressed to find more influential companies in today's society. That fact has not been lost on investors. Over the past four years, both stocks have quintupled in value.

Image source: Getty Images.

But which is a better buy today? That's a difficult question to answer, though we can get a better understanding for what we're buying by looking at the question through three different lenses.

Sustainable competitive advantages

If I had one word of advice for beginning investors, it would be this: Spend the bulk of your time investigating a company's sustainable competitive advantages. Often referred to as a ""moat"" by investors, sustainable competitive advantages are what keep customers coming back for more every year and consistently keep the competition at bay.

Netflix benefits from, as I see it, three different types of moats. The first is the brand. The Qwikster fiasco not withstanding, the company has won over legions of loyal customers who appreciate the service and its original content. That original content is key, as it is gets people hooked into the Netflix ecosystem.

Management is able to target its original content because it has more data on our viewing habits than any other organization in the history of the world. That also gives the company the upper hand when it comes to paying for content from third-party providers. Imagine the negotiating table: Netflix knows just how popular certain shows are to its viewers and how valuable it is. The other side has no idea. That asymmetry provides pricing power.

Image source: Getty Images.

Finally, Netflix benefits from a sneaky type of moat I only recently came to appreciate. Once customers sign on, the cost of the monthly plan is so low -- and the payments fully automated -- that a user would have to be highly motivated to cancel his/her membership.

Facebook, on the other hand, benefits from one of the most powerful moats in the world: the network effect. With each additional member who joins Facebook, non-members are incentivized to join as a way of keeping up with their friends and family. It's a virtuous cycle that is in full effect. Even though the company already has over 1 billion daily active users, its roster continues to grow -- up 18% year over year.

Not only that but Facebook gets essentially all of its content for free. That's often underappreciated by investors. Imagine what a boon it would be if Netflix never had to pay for its shows.

At the end of the day, both of these companies have powerful moats. In years past, I would have given the nod to Facebook. But my realization of how easy it is for Netflix to keep subscribers -- and how effective original content is at bringing in new users -- is enough to call this a draw.

Winner = Tie

Financial fortitude

While conservative investors love seeing cash returned to them via dividends and more aggressive investors love seeing cash reinvested in a company's growth prospects, there's something to be said for cash.

Every company will experience difficult financial times, and the companies that enter those phases with lots of cash will prosper. They will have the flexibility to outspend rivals and gain market share, repurchase stock on the cheap, and even make strategic acquisitions. Debt-laden companies will be in the opposite boat, forced to satisfy the whims of their creditors.

Company Cash Debt Net Income Free Cash Flow Netflix $1.7 billion $3.4 billion $0.2 billion ($1.6 billion) Facebook $30 billion $0 $10.2 billion $11.6 billion

Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Cash includes cash, short, and long-term investments.

Here, we have a very clear winner. Netflix is spending lots of cash on its international expansion and original programing. That's a great strategy because, as mentioned above, once customers are locked in, they're a reliable source of recurring revenue.

But with that strategy comes financial fragility. Netflix is free cash flow negative, while Facebook is a cash machine with no long-term debt whatsoever.

Winner = Facebook

Valuation

Finally, we have valuation. While this isn't an exact science, there are some straightforward metrics we can consult to give us an idea of how expensive each stock is.

Company P/E P/FCF PEG Ratio Netflix 340 N/A 1.6 Facebook 32 34 1.1

Data source: SEC filings, E*Trade. P/E represents figures from non-GAAP earnings.

Here again, we have a clear winner. Because of the aforementioned spending, Netflix is very expensive based on traditional metrics.

Facebook, on the other hand, looks like a pretty good deal at today's prices. While a P/E of 32 would never be described as ""cheap,"" the company increased earnings by 86% last year, and is expected to grow by 28% moving forward.

Winner = Facebook

The winner is...

So there you have it: While both companies have powerful moats, Facebook has a better balance sheet and appears to be a better value at today's prices. You really can't go wrong by investing in either, but I'm a much stronger fan of Facebook at today's levels. That helps explain why it accounts for 14% of my real-life holdings, while Netflix clocks in at just 2%.

All analysts and investors eventually make bad calls, but Greenfield's upgrade raised eyebrows, since it clearly went against the popular view that Twitter was stuck in a terminal decline. Let's take a look at why Greenfield believed that Twitter could make a comeback, and why those bullish ideas might be misguided.

Why did BTIG believe in Twitter?

Greenfield believed that several catalysts would help Twitter recover. First, he saw a ""meaningful uptick"" in downloads of the iOS app, which he attributed to the U.S. election and President Trump's widely covered use of the platform. Second, he noted that a recent CivicScience survey showed an increase in the app's daily active users (DAUs). Greenfield cited those two factors as evidence of higher user engagement.

As user growth and engagement rebound, Greenfield believes that advertisers and potential suitors could return. The analyst doesn't ""expect immediate financial benefits"" in the first half of the year, but believes that Twitter's ""second half 2017 revenues could exceed investors' expectations with 2018 well above consensus.""

Why were those ideas misguided?

Greenfield's claim that iOS downloads were rising is true. According to App Annie, Twitter's iOS rank in the U.S. surged from 33th to 8th place between Feb. 29, 2016 and Jan. 20, 2017. Unfortunately, that growth quickly reversed after Trump's inauguration, and the app slipped back to 26th place at the end of February.

Greenfield's claim that DAUs are rising was also confirmed in Twitter's earnings report, which revealed that its DAUs rose 11% annually during the quarter -- an acceleration from 7% growth in the third quarter, 5% growth in the second quarter, and 3% growth in the first quarter. However, Twitter left out one crucial number -- the actual number of DAUs.

That figure matters because Twitter's monthly active users (MAUs) only rose 4% annually to 319 million during the quarter. If Twitter's DAU growth is outpacing its MAU growth, it means a small group of power users are tweeting more frequently, but the platform still isn't reeling in casual users. Twitter also hasn't made it easy for casual users to get started, since it still hasn't adequately addressed common complaints like its 140-character limit, non-threaded replies, and the proliferation of fake and spam accounts -- all of which make user-to-user interactions difficult.

Why advertisers and potential buyers aren't coming back

Some of the company's decisions over the last few years have set it up for an uphill battle in winning back advertisers and potential acquirers.

First, former CEO Dick Costolo pivoted Twitter toward a ""cost per engagement"" model which let advertisers pay for only the interactions (tweets, likes, retweets) that they wanted.

At the time, Costolo believed that move would help it reach smaller businesses with limited advertising budgets. Instead, the move backfired and allowed large customers to pay less money for fewer clicks. Twitter still hasn't recovered from that move -- that's probably why its core advertising revenues fell 0.5% annually last quarter.

As for a buyout, CEO Jack Dorsey and previous suitors seem to have abandoned the idea. In January, Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google agreed to buy most of Twitter's developer products for an undisclosed sum. That sale indicates that Twitter could sell off non-core businesses to generate fresh cash -- which might be attractive to companies like Google, which value Twitter's tech but don't want its stalled out user base, sluggish advertising business, and controversies regarding bullying, trolling, and illegal accounts. Dorsey's recent purchase of $7 million in shares also indicates that the co-founder believes in Twitter's long-term future -- which might mean that a buyout is off the table.

Beating estimates in 2017 and 2018 might not matter

Lastly, Greenfield's suggestion that Twitter could beat expectations in 2017 and 2018 isn't as bullish as it sounds. Analysts expect Twitter's revenue to fall 6.4% this year and rebound 7.5% next year -- indicating that Twitter's 2018 revenue will remain nearly flat from 2016 levels. Beating those estimates won't put Twitter back on the track to higher growth.

Greenfield might believe that time will eventually prove his thesis right. However, Twitter's slumping sales growth, the sluggish evolution of its platform, and a CEO that splits his time between two companies all indicate that things could get much worse before they get better.

For those who haven't been following the news since Snap ( SNAP ) announced its intentions to go public , the press cycle has been on a rollercoaster ride. Initial valuation estimates in the $20-25bn range were quickly followed by a few bolder claims that the IPO may fetch the company a valuation as high as $40bn . With this in mind, immediate post-announcement commentary was decisively bearish, and largely centered around the company's disproportionately high price compared to revenues of only $405m in 2016.

As time has gone by, more thoughtful analyses have shifted attention over to Snap's growth prospects, and here significant concerns have emerged over the company's slowing user growth , drawing comparisons to Twitter's ( TWTR ) lackluster post-IPO performance , and thus placing serious questions on the purported valuation figures. As a result, Snap has reportedly lowered its expectations , and certain estimates expect pricing to come as low as $14-$16 per share, implying a valuation of $16-19bn .

Ahead of its expected pricing (anticipated on March 1st ) we take a look at whether the rumored valuation makes sense, and provide our own guidance on where investors should be pricing the stock.

We find that while overall market concerns regarding DAU growth are justified, the market is likely undervaluing the company's ARPU growth prospects and conclude that there is significant upside on the table for investors. For us, Snap is a buy.

As mentioned, initial reports largely focused on comparing Snap's purported valuation to its revenues, which when compared to its peers, admittedly looks very expensive (table 1).

But such an analysis misses the mark completely in two important ways. Firstly, many of the companies in Snap's peer universe are not directly comparable (Google ( GOOG ) ( GOOGL ) is a search company and Amazon ( AMZN ) is an online retailer, to name a few). Limiting the peer universe to Snap's most directly comparable peers, Facebook ( FB ) and Twitter, is a more appropriate juxtaposition (charts 1 and 2).

But even when just limiting one's comparison to Facebook and Twitter, the maturity profiles of the respective companies are very different and must be accounted for. A fairer analysis would look at the metrics pre-IPO for all three (charts 3 and 4). In doing so, readers will notice that the relative valuation, albeit still expensive, looks less so than in the prior charts.

There are still timing issues with such a comparison though. For reference, Facebook was eight years old and Twitter was seven at the time of their IPOs. Snap is only five, and with 2-3 more years of growth under its belt, Snap could be a very different company.

Moreover, Snap is a direct-to-mobile platform while Facebook and Twitter went public in a world in which desktop-delivery still played a dominant role. Considering the shift from desktop to mobile, Snap is entering a market with a growing user base (mobile taking share from desktop) on a delivery platform that is capturing increasing user engagement (charts 5 and 6).

In summary, the different maturity profiles coupled with the different delivery platforms, both now as well as at IPO, make for a troublesome comparables-based approach when assessing Snap's valuation. Snap may look expensive when compared to its peers, but comparing to its peers is not the right approach.

With the above in mind, a Snap-only analysis makes most sense. And such an analysis should almost solely be focused on one thing: growth. For any company at Snap's stage, growth is paramount to valuation, and to this end, there are fundamentally two things that affect growth going forward:

1) Growth in Daily Active Users (DAUs), and

2) Growth in Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)

We look at these in turn.

Much of the more insightful analysis which emerged a few weeks after the filing has in fact focused on DAU growth. And the hawks are out in flock. Unfortunately for Snap,while initial user growth performance was impressive (chart 7), there has been a significant downtick in new users joining the platform in recent months. Despite outperforming both Facebook and Twitter in terms of user growth in the six quarters leading up to its IPO, Snap saw quarterly growth rates drop from double digit figures to only 7% in Q3 16 and, even more worryingly, to a paltry 3.3% in Q4 16 (chart 8).

Management's justification for the following can be found in their S1, where they state :

""The rate of net additional Daily Active Users was relatively flat in the early part of the quarter ended December 31, 2016, and accelerated in the month of December. Although we have historically experienced lumpiness in the growth of our Daily Active Users, we believe that the flat growth in the early part of the quarter was primarily related to accelerated growth in user engagement earlier in the year, diminished product performance, and increased competition. The rate of net additional Daily Active Users accelerated in the first half of 2016 compared to the second half of 2015, largely due to increased user engagement from product launches and increased adoption rates among older demographics and international markets. This created a higher baseline of Daily Active Users heading into the third and fourth quarters, so incremental net additions within these quarters were more difficult even with strong year-over-year growth. Additionally, in mid-2016, we launched several products and released multiple updates, which introduced a number of technical issues that diminished the performance of our application. We believe these performance issues resulted in a reduction in the growth of our Daily Active Users, particularly among Android users and regions with a higher percentage of Android devices. Finally, we also saw increased competition both domestically and internationally in 2016, as many of our competitors launched products with similar functionality to ours.""

The above explanation thus emphasizes two key potential causes for the slowdown in growth: technical issues with their Android product, and/or increasing competition.

The former,while problematic, would not be a significant cause for concern. One would think that a company funded to the tune of $2.6bn and with nearly 2,000 employees (many of them in engineering) would be able to solve this and revert the company's growth course back to what it was at the beginning of 2016.

But the more worrying concern revolves around competition. Snap faces increasing pressure from competitors, particularly Facebook and Instagram, which, if unresolved, could continue to limit DAU growth going forward. In fact, it is no wonder that Snapchat's growth numbers began suffering in Q3 16 as this was exactly when Instagram launched Stories , a near-blatant copy of Snapchat's namesake.

Unfortunately for Snap, data regarding growth in DAU by geography only lends further weight to the competition concerns. In fact, on a geographical basis, much of the slowdown in Snap's DAUs appears to have been primarily in the ""Rest of World"" region (chart 9). Given Instagram's significantly larger user base abroad ( 80% of Instagram's c.300m DAUs are international ), one could see how the incentives for installing Snapchat diminishes as Instagram (and other competitors) begin to offer the key features that Snapchat has to-date sold itself on.

To summarize, things don't look good for Snapchat from a DAU growth perspective. Not only was Q4 16 Snap's lowest growing quarter since the beginning of its publicly available data, but it was even slower than that of Facebook, a far more mature company (chart 10). Given these headwinds, Snap will have to effectively convince investors that it can address its decelerating quarter-over-quarter DAU growth if it wishes to hit the valuation numbers that have been publicized.

Looking Ahead: Facebook Growth or Twitter Struggles?

With the above in mind, our expectation is that Snap, going forward, will experience a user growth profile more akin to Twitter's than to Facebook's.While growth will be sustained by its continued popularity in the United States, competition from Facebook, Instagram and other international competitors will continue to limit Snap's growth internationally.

Our base case expectation is therefore for an average of 14.1% growth per year post-IPO, almost right in between Facebook's and Twitter's annual average growth rates of 19.1% and 10.3%, respectively (table 2). The primary source of the growth premium to Twitter derives from Snapchat's ability to innovate on product features better than Twitter (more on this below).

ARPU Growth: Solid Start with Ample Upside Remaining

Whilst the above DAU estimates are nothing for investors to get excited about, and fall largely in line with most market commentary, stopping one's analysis at DAU performance is shortsighted. In particular, it misses the key other side of the coin: ARPU. And when it comes to ARPU growth, we see a radically different story. Our view is that Snapchat will see strong ARPU growth going forward, driven by the following factors:

A more monetization-friendly product

A more advantageous position with a key user demographic

A generally more monetization-focused management mindset

All of these will in turn be boosted by general underlying strength in the mobile advertising space. We look at these in turn.

One of the most attractive features of Snapchat from an ARPU standpoint is that the product itself appears to lend itself very well, arguably better than its competitors, to monetization. The effectiveness of the platform is largely driven by Snap's ability to innovate on product features and stay ahead of the competition, and this has allowed Snap to build impressively strong positions in image sharing and in video.

Looking first at image sharing, Snap has caught up rapidly with its competitors (chart 11) largely thanks to its ability to innovate with the format (initially with disappearing messages, later with filters, Stories, etc.). The implication of this is significant in that it has allowed Snap to lead the industry in terms of developing and delivering sponsored / branded content for this type of format. For instance, focusing on sponsored filters, Snap's ability to reach a large audience far exceeds Facebook despite its significantly smaller user base (chart 12).

The growth in image sharing and the innovation surrounding its product features has positioned Snap favorably amongst advertisers, allowing Snap to strike important partnerships with very significant brands worldwide. One of the examples of such campaigns that Snap highlights in its S1 relates to how Wendy's blanketed its U.S. stores with Sponsored Geofilters that promoted the Jalapeño Fresco Chicken Sandwich. Snap's measurement tool reported that the Sponsored Geofilter drove over 42,000 incremental people to a Wendy's location within seven days of viewing the Sponsored Geofilter.

Perhaps more important than image sharing, Snap has developed a dominant position in video, converting it into a serious threat to Facebook . According to the KCPB presentation , as of Q1 16 Snap has surpassed Facebook in terms of daily video views despite its significantly smaller user base (chart 13).

This success to date has been driven by Snap's unique approach to the video format. KCPB refers to Snaps approach as "" 3V Advertising "": (1) Vertical - made for mobile viewing, (2) Video - a great way to tell a story, (3) Viewing - always full screen.

The combination of these three has made video advertising that much more effective on Snapchat. In fact, according to the KCPB presentation, outside of Snapchat many video ads are ineffective with 81% of people muting the ads. However, Snap points out in its S-1 that on average, 60% of all Snap Ads are watched with the sound on.

The above again points to Snap's effectiveness as a monetization platform as well as the management team's ability to keep innovating on product and stay ahead of the curve when it comes to marrying fun and engaging product features with monetization avenues. A recent example of success with video would beGatorade's sponsored lens during the Super Bowl, a campaign which led to 60 million plays in total, 165 million views and an increase of 8 points in purchase intent.

Snap has developed the ultimate trifecta - a robust advertising platform that combines communications (chatting), image creation and sharing, and video content. This has lead to numerous marketing campaigns achieving above average industry impact, performance and ROI. This should support rapid growth of ARPU as more marketers recognize these benefits and decide to move advertising dollars over to Snap.

As the pool of mobile advertising investment dollars rises, more advertisers are looking to target Millennials and younger demographics. In 2015, Marketers dedicated over a third (34%) of their annual marketing budgets to targeting these groups. That figure was likely even greater with teens and "" tweens "" included.

The above phenomenon is largely because Millennials are expected to drive consumer spending in the years to come. Millennials are 80 million strong , the largest demographic in the United States, and as of March 2015, also the largest demographic in the workforce .

This of course translates into huge spending power. Estimates indicate Millennials could be spending $1.4 trillion annually by 2020 and could inherit as much as $30 billion in the coming years. Even teens and tweens are generating significant spending power, spending as much as Baby Boomers in 2015.

The issue advertisers face is that Millennials are moving away from traditional advertising channels to their phones (chart 14). Companies like Snap, as well as its competitors, provide an optimal channel through which to target these groups.

Fortunately for Snap, they seem to have developed a very strong position in these age-groups. With 63% of Snap users in the 18-34 age category, and 22% between 13-17 years of age, Snap has captured the attention of a highly coveted marketing demographic (chart 15 - note: chart is from a 2016 comScore report, as such the data does not perfectly tie with Snap's latest demographics reported in its S-1).

More importantly, Snap has become a leading platform in terms of its engagement within 18-34 age demographic (chart 16). Facebook is clearly a dominant player with massive reach and significant engagement, but Snapchat is the second leading platform in terms of average monthly minutes per visitor. As Snap continues to expand its reach and further penetrate this key age group, Snap should move higher and further to the right on this chart as it continues to threaten Facebook's leadership.

This all bodes very well for Snap. The company has continued to rapidly expand its reach within the 18-24 category while also broadening its penetration within older age groups. As of December 2015, according to comScore, more than three-out-of-five 18-24 year olds now actively use Snapchat, with older age groups also on the rise (chart 17).

With a dominance in the Millennial, Teen and Tween demographics, the second leading platform in terms of monthly engagement and further expansion of its reach within each of those key demographics Snap should receive an outsized portion of advertising dollars going forward. This should support rapid ARPU expansion in the coming years.

Putting the above two tactical points aside, the most encouraging thing about Snap is that management has consistently shown a greater predisposition and knack for converting fun new product features into monetization avenues. In short: Snap management appears to be excellent at monetization.

And the results bear this out. When comparing to Facebook and Twitter, Snap started monetizing earlier, and has grown faster in terms of ARPU than both of its comparables, despite being several years ""younger"" as a company (charts 18 and 19).

Admittedly, claiming that Snap is simply better at monetizing than its comps is a subjective and difficult-to-prove assertion. However, if you believe this, then what makes this an even more interesting point is when you consider how much upside could still be left for Snap to capture. To this end, a simple side-by-side comparison of ARPU numbers with Facebook and Twitter suggests that Snap's ARPU could rise as much as 7x what it is today (chart 20).

For us, Snap's impressive historical performance in ARPU driven by its clear ability to innovate in product and monetization, combined with the tremendous upside still there for the taking, points to strong and rapid catch-up in terms of ARPU in the years to come. It is therefore not surprising to us that after having failed to acquire Snapchat, Facebook has now reverted to replicating its features consistently .

Aside from the intrinsic strengths of Snap as a company, it's also obvious that overall underlying industry strength will help sustain ARPU growth in the coming years (although the extent to which this will be remains a question).

According to a report from IDC , ad spending is expected to grow from $652 billion in 2016 to $767 billion in 2020 with mobile specific spending growing 3x from $66 billion in 2016 to $196 billion in 2020. Social media marketing in particular is expected to grow 20% per year to $50.2bn in 2019, comfortably overtaking newspaper advertising by 2020.

Moreover, according to KPCB , there is a $22bn market opportunity in mobile advertising as it is the only growing outlet in terms of percent of consumption time. This should continue to encourage marketers to shift away from more legacy outlets like TV and print and into mobile (chart 21). Given that Snap's entire advertising inventory is on mobile, a growing pool of total mobile advertising dollars will certainly benefit Snap going forward.

For further revenue upside one can't overlook Snap's potential to develop ancillary products.

Snap has already demonstrated a willingness to explore new product categories with the launch of Spectacles in September 2016, its first ever hardware product. New product developments outside of software could potentially provide Snap with a very interesting monetization model that is different from their competitors (FB is exploring VR) and a unique way of owning more of the user's share of mind.

Spectacles are wearable glasses with a built-in camera that links seamlessly to a smartphone to create unique Snaps from a ""human perspective."" The company views Spectacles as an extension of Snapchat and intends to use the glasses to create a unique circular format for video as opposed to the standard rectangular viewing perspective (once again reinventing the standard video delivery model).

Spectacles do generate revenue for Snap, but for 2016 the revenues were not material and, thus, not reported in the company's filing. Going forward, Spectacles could represent a much larger portion of Snap's revenue.

It's unclear what other types of new products Snap is planning to bring to market, but Snap has demonstrated a strong ability to create innovative and sticky products that drive incremental user growth and revenue (chart 22). Expect each new product introduction to be strategic in driving user growth, enhancing user engagement, and increasing share of mind, all things that should bring create even greater revenue opportunities for Snap.

Looking ahead and given all of the above, our expectation is that despite slowing user growth, Snap's platform should support very strong ARPU growth going forward. We see Snap's ARPU catching up with Facebook's in the next five years, and it would not surprise us if it surpasses it further out. In other words, despite Twitter-like user growth, Snap is likely to experience more of a Facebook-like, if not better, ARPU growth profile.

The biggest risk to this scenario playing out mainly relates to Facebook and other competitors' ability to replicate Snap's features both quickly and effectively. Should this be the case, Snap's leadership in product innovation will likely fail to spill over into significant ARPU growth. However, should competitors struggle to play the ""catch-up game"" well enough, Snap will likely see ARPU growth rates in line with what we predict below. The latter has been interestingly described as the ""Gingerbread strategy"" in this article .

With that in mind we anticipate two possible ARPU growth trajectories. Our downside case projections are more in line with other commentaries and essentially consider the latter scenario of product innovation followed by effective catch-up by competitors. The base case is instead predicated on management's ability to keep innovating on product, and competitors' relative ineffectiveness at copying such features.

The numbers of both cases are displayed in table 3 below, but the highlight is that in our base case projections, we anticipate north of 50% CAGR over the next five years, with ARPU catching up to Facebook's 2016 numbers by 2019/2020.

With all of the above in mind, we can now proceed to calculating our estimated valuation for Snap. We first look at what Snap's revenues will look like going forward, based on our DAU and ARPU assumptions outlined above, and then move into a valuation analysis using these revenue estimates.

Financial Forecasts

Our financial forecasts are summarized in Table 4, but the headline numbers we want to highlight are the following:

DAU growth in between Twitter and Facebook's post-IPO performance, reaching 246 million DAUs by 2019

Strong ARPU catch-up and growth, reaching $6.88 per user by 2019, nearly equaling Facebook's current 2016 ARPU numbers, in the Base Case

More limited ARPU growth in the Downside Case, reaching $4.80 by 2019, in line with Twitter's current ARPU numbers

Total Revenues of $1.6 billion and $3.8 billion achieved in 2017 and 2018, respectively, in the Base Case

Total Revenues of $1.3 billion and $2.7billion achieved in 2017 and 2018, respectively, in the Downside Case

We value Snap on an EV / Revenue basis using a target multiple range of 6.0x to 10.0x derived from the midpoint of the range between Facebook and Twitter current trading multiples. On the one hand, Snap's more limited DAU growth warrants a lower multiple than Facebook's, but on the other hand its more favourable ARPU prospects warrant a premium to Twitter's multiple. We apply these multiple to forward 2018 revenue estimates to account for Snap being a younger company than both of its comps. Our valuation estimates are summarised in Table 5 below, but the key takeaways are as follows:

Despite limited DAU growth, our base case ARPU assumptions imply a valuation of c. $30bn based off a 8.0x multiple on 2018 forward revenue estimates

In our bearish case, we come out at $22bn on 2018 forward revenue estimates, in line but still slightly above more recent price targets.

Overall, we see strong upside potential for Snap going forward, with the valuation potentially rising to nearly $50bn assuming greater maturity of their comps justifies using Snap's 2019 forward revenue estimates for the valuation, concluding that this stock is a buy.

Snap: Twitter growth, but Facebook ARPU

In many respects, one could say that the Snap IPO heralds a more general shift in social media platforms from building for user growth to building for user engagement and monetization. Since inception, Snap has always felt more like a blend between a traditional social media app and a gaming app. The more playful nature of the platform has in turn translated positively into monetization and ARPU growth, far more so than Snap's peers did at their equivalent stages of their lifecycle. Whether a purposeful management strategy or not, Snap seems better built for monetization.

This of course is occurring concurrently with an increasing shift in advertising spend from traditional media outlets to online/digital and particular mobile channels. In many ways, it feels like advertisers are reaching the tipping point of shifting a majority of their dollars to social media and ""new media"" channels.

As a result, we view Snap's future financial prospects very favorably, and per our analysis above, conclude that Snap is a buy. Snap's value is a function of being the first social media platform that has been built with advertisers in mind from the beginning.

2/28/2017,0.405711817,0.111535378,825.61,828.54,820.2,823.21,2260769,8.34,-2.4,0,"When Brandon Schatz learned in December 2012 that Kansas City, Kansas had become the first city in the nation to get Google Fiber, a superfast Internet service, he started making plans to move his nascent sports photography business there. The day after Christmas, he drove the 165 miles from his home in Springfield, Missouri, to check it out. By February 1, he had settled into his new house. By February 4, he was connected to the network.

That was exactly what officials had wanted. When the area (first Kansas City, Kansas, with Kansas City, Missouri added weeks later) won a challenge to be the first to get Google Fiber, local boosters celebrated, hoping to kickstart an economic renaissance: attracting entrepreneurs, cultivating emerging business districts, and becoming known as a major startup hub.

Four years later, Schatz’s company Sportsphotos.com, which takes photos of amateur sporting events around the country, is growing slowly. He’s taking full advantage of the speedy internet, uploading hundreds of high-resolution photos in minutes from races and other matches. But the business isn’t yet where he wants it to be, and for now Schatz’s main source of income is web development work and renting out rooms in his home on Airbnb. On a recent Sunday, Schatz sat in his home, where he also operates his company, pecking away at a desktop, surrounded by pizza boxes. “I thought we would be huge already,” he said.

Schatz’s disappointment is a tale of misplaced expectations, by both entrepreneurs and city leaders. (The challenges that he and other startup founders face is the subject of the latest episode of the Decrypted podcast; subscribe here on iTunes.) In 2011 the cities’ two mayors called Fiber’s then-future deployment “a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” and a way to “spark economic development.” And for Google, which since significantly has pared down support for the project, it was a case of placing too much faith in the ability of its own technology to change lives.

It’s also been hard for the Kansas City area to become the boom town that leaders dreamed of. Some entrepreneurs, like Schatz, were drawn to the city because of the fiber, and some launched businesses. A “startup village” sprang up. But few of the companies really took off, and some frustrated founders ended up decamping to San Francisco, where there was a larger talent pool and greater access to capital. Even the best of intentions and super-speedy internet isn’t enough to create a new Silicon Valley.

Every year after Alphabet Inc.’s Google’s first fiber connections lit up in late 2012, greater Kansas City’s GDP growth has fallen well short of the national average. In 2015, it was just 1.5%, compared to 2.6% for the nation as a whole. Metro regional numbers aren’t yet available for all of 2016, although based on state numbers through the third quarter, both Kansas and Missouri seem to be beating the national average.

“We’re scratching our heads a little bit,” said Jeff Pinkerton of the Mid America Regional Council, a nonprofit that conducts economic research for greater Kansas City. “Why is Kansas City really not taking off, especially with this asset like Google Fiber?”

Google came to town in 2011. At Wyandotte High School auditorium, on the Kansas side, blue, red, yellow and green spotlights shone on a parade of dignitaries who addressed the audience. Google founder Sergey Brin spoke on a prerecorded video. After the announcement about fiber going into Kansas City, a Google vice president invited the crowd to a barbecue-laden celebration.

Kansas City beat out more than 1,000 other cities for the debut Google fiber project, which aimed to compete against the telecommunications and cable giants that have dominated the market for Internet access. Some analysts believed the ultimate goal was to encourage those competitors to improve their own services and thus the Internet experience overall, which would bolster the environment for Alphabet’s most lucrative business: online search.

Mayors of both cities announced a team of civic leaders to figure out how best to leverage fiber, in entrepreneurship as well as other areas such as education. The group released a plan in 2012 that made recommendations ranging from nurturing technology districts to supporting tax credits for small technology businesses to creating mentor networks.

Despite budget challenges, the state of Kansas has stuck by a preexisting income tax credit of up to $50,000 for angel backers who invest in a young company. Working with a group called Techstars, Kansas City-based Sprint Corp. created an incubator for startups. The Kauffman Foundation, a think tank based in Kansas City, Mo., started a weekly gathering for entrepreneurs.

An area straddling State Line Road, the border, became the first neighborhood that Google wired for fiber, and a community of founders sprang up. The district, which had zoning laws that made it easier to run a business from home, became known as Startup Village. That’s where Schatz, the owner of Sportsphotos.com, moved into a rental house.

It was an online video about the Kansas City experiment that drew him. He realized that Google Fiber could be the key to his nascent business: Batches of photos that took 40 to 50 hours to upload would be done in less than one. “It’s a little nerdy, to see this video and be all kinds of inspired,” says Schatz, 34, a boyish looking former U.S. army sergeant whose tours of duty included Bosnia. “But I was inspired.”

Yet in practice, a dazzling Internet connection didn’t mean much for some businesses. Mike Farmer operated his startup, Leap, a search engine, out of a Startup Village house for a while. “What do you do with gigabit speed that makes the experience more relevant?” he recalls asking his team. They goofed around with ideas, such as having search results take the form of several high-definition Netflix movies streaming at the same time. Given that most users wouldn’t have gigabit Internet, Leap never did find the right scenario. Farmer wound down the business last year.

“The true power of Google fiber is exposure,” says Matthew Marcus, executive director of the Kansas City Startup Foundation and co-leader of the Startup Village, referring to the publicity the technology brought to the city’s startup community. “The fact is, it’s really difficult to consume one gigabit of speed.”

Some startups have contended with the lack of access to a big talent pool. Tech companies in Silicon Valley, Waterloo, Canada, and New York City, tend to hire from nearby universities with strong software-engineering programs. The schools with the strongest engineering schools in the region are more than two hours away from Kansas City, though.Funding has also been a problem in Kansas City. Entrepreneurs lamented that local investors looked for the type of traction that would merit tens of millions of dollars from Silicon Valley venture firms. But if businesses achieve that, Midwestern venture firms invest just single-digit millions. Lack of access to capital contributed to the departure of two promising Kansas City startups, bond marketplace Neighborly and green-homebuilder Acre, which both moved most operations to Silicon Valley.

“There are plenty of angels that will write $50,000 checks, but there’s not that much bridge,” says Sandy Kemper, chief executive officer of Fairway, Kansas-based C2FO, a working-capital finance company he founded in 2008. Kemper turned to big investors outside Kansas City, including San Francisco’s Mithril Capital and Singapore’s Temasek Holdings, for most of his backing. In his hometown, “there is a finer filter, and maybe a little bit higher hurdle.”

One advantage cited by many local entrepreneurs, low costs, can actually backfire. “It might be a misplaced sense of comfort,” says Ajay Royan, the general partner at Mithril Capital who invested in C2FO. He believes the best entrepreneurs work with an intensity driven by the reality of global competition—a reality too easily lost sight of in a low-pressure, low-cost environment. “If you get comfortable with the fact that things seem to be going well in Kansas City,” he says, and don’t think beyond it, “that’s bad.”

C2FO is one many other entrepreneurs hope will eventually list on a public market and raise hundreds of millions of dollars, with a valuation north of a billion. It has already raised $99 million and is used by some of the world’s biggest companies, including Acer, Costco, BNSF Railway, and Pfizer. That type of public offering, more than anything, would truly foster entrepreneurship in Kansas City, entrepreneurs say. It would show existing investors the upside of investing more than a few thousand dollars in startups, along with creating a class of richly rewarded early employees who would in turn likely become investors in other startups—or founders of their own.

Lance LeMay, a venture capitalist at Kansas City, Missouri-based Open Air Equity Partners who invested in Kemper’s and Farmer’s companies, said boosting the venture-backed startup ecosystem in Kansas City won’t even take that much. “More than a billion-dollar exit, you need lots of successful exits,” he said. “You don’t need a home run. You need lots of doubles.”

In the years that Kansas City has been trying to make the most out of Fiber, Google has been doing the same. In early days, company executives talked it up, with executive chairman Eric Schmidt telling conference goers in late 2012 that of all the company’s current innovations, including self-driving cars, it was Google’s “most compelling on many levels,” something that “changes your life.” Shortly afterward, it started announcing more cities for the project, beginning with Austin, Texas, and Provo, Utah. In 2013, the company recruited Craig Barratt, a wireless chip industry veteran, to lead the group that included Fiber. In 2015, when Google became Alphabet, Barratt was given the title of CEO. Over time, Google Fiber announced it would expand into 21 cities.

But just as Kansas City might have overestimated the asset Google Fiber could become, Google overestimated Fiber’s impact, and its expansion plans deflated. Barratt left in October 2016, surprising many employees. The same day, the unit announced it was stalling expansion plans in eight cities and cutting 9 percent of its staff. This month, Alphabet hired Barratt’s replacement, broadband executive Gregory McCray, and further slimmed Fiber, shifting hundreds of its employees over to Google’s core Internet business.

Fiber is now in only nine locations, including Atlanta and Orange County, Calif. Other Bets, the part of Alphabet that Google Fiber belongs to, reported losses of $3.58 billion last year on revenue of $809 million. It also contributed to Other Bets’ $1.39 billion in capital expenditures.

A number of factors lay behind Fiber’s strategic shift. Former employees said a chief reason was the discrepancy between the desires of Google's co-founders to expand the service and make it faster and the demanding costs of providing it. Cable incumbents moved aggressively, introducing similar high-speed services at low prices. Unexpected political hurdles emerged. In Louisville, Kentucky, for instance, AT&T and Charter Communications sued the municipality over a wonky utility ordinance that would ease Google Fiber’s installation.

“Google invested in Fiber during a time when it was willing to make lots of big investments with uncertain or long-term returns, but over the last couple of years Google has become a different place,” says Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research. “It doesn’t necessarily make sense for Alphabet to continue to invest in it as heavily at this point.”

Schatz recently changed his business model. Instead of getting amateur athletes to pay for the photos, they download them for free, with sponsorship fees providing his revenue. Having observed the reluctance of local investors to back companies that lack strong income, he is working to build relationships with big sports retailers and fitness companies that could sponsor the blanket photography of the events he shoots.

The race-photography business alone is worth $20 to $50 million annually a year on sponsorships, he calculates; add in other amateur sports and expanded marketing initiatives and it could be exponentially more. But for now, he’s capturing just a tiny portion; revenue last year doubled but was still under $100,000, he says. This year, he hopes to keep growing and achieve profitability.

He knows developing ties to potential sponsors would be much easier in a city like New York or Los Angeles, but he believes he can pull it off from the heartland.

Sometimes, he thinks back to advice a venture capitalist gave him a few years ago, to drop everything else and focus only on his business. The laid-back atmosphere in Kansas City made it easier to put that advice aside, he says.

“It probably would have been good to have extra pressure,” he says now. Still, he says perks such as a community of fellow entrepreneurs make him happy he stayed put.

Meanwhile, some of the original startup supporters in Startup Village have sold their real estate to non-entrepreneurs.

After Google Fiber came to town, Brad Feld, a venture capitalist at Boulder, Colo.-based Foundry Group bought a bungalow in Startup Village for use, gratis, by a promising young company. For a time, Leap’s Farmer housed interns there. Today, a start-up engineer lives in the house. On a recent visit, a layer of dark fuzz and grime obscured floors. A vacuum cleaner stood at the far end of the main room, plugged in but apparently unused. A side room lacked furniture, but did sport a large pile of clothing flung in its center. A skittish cat bolted across the kitchen.

Three doors down the street, Schatz has decided to launch an intense search for financial backers. An early port of call: Silicon Valley.

—With Mark Bergen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2/28/2017,0.392618146,0.000813943,825.61,828.54,820.2,823.21,2260769,8.34,-2.4,0,"Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is reportedly scaling back its chatbot efforts on Messenger after the programs failed to fulfill 70% of users' requests. The Information reports that those requests couldn't be handled without human agents, and bots built by outside developers ""had issues"" because the ""technology to understand human requests wasn't developed enough.""

So instead of building a large ecosystem of chatbots, Facebook will train Messenger bots to handle ""a narrower set of cases, so users aren't disappointed by the limitations of automation."" Let's see what this strategic shift means for Facebook's AI efforts, and whether or not chatbots will ever become meaningful tools for the social network.

Understanding Facebook's AI strategy

Artificial intelligence plays a vital role in helping Facebook track users and deliver targeted ads. By using AI to scan a user's status updates, photos, videos, check-ins, likes, linked apps, and other data, Facebook generates digital profiles of users which help it deliver targeted ads to their News Feeds. In 2013, Facebook launched the FAIR (Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research) unit to continuously upgrade those AI capabilities.

That's where Messenger comes in. In 2014, Facebook forced users to download the stand-alone Messenger app to keep chatting. That move -- which clearly mirrored Tencent's (NASDAQOTH:TCEHY) WeChat -- laid the foundations for Messenger to become a ""platform"" which could eventually offer ride hailing, mobile payments, deliveries, games and other services from a single app.

That move would give Facebook an ""OS within an OS"" to counter the iOS App Store and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Play. Facebook's next step would be to replace apps with Messenger chatbots, which were introduced last April. If that effort works, it could turn the entire mobile app store model upside down.

The premature rise of the chatbots

In theory, a business chatbot could answer questions, make purchase suggestions, process orders, and send shipping updates to customers. For customers, having ""conversations"" with these bots would feel more natural than scrolling and clicking through a mobile app. Companies could also cut costs by reducing the number of human customer service representatives.

Facebook tethers those bots to Messenger for Business, which provides a live customer service chat channel for a large number of businesses. Businesses can choose to put a human or a chatbot to handle queries on their end. This idea attracted a lot of early adopters -- 30,000 Facebook bots were already active on Messenger as of last September.

But just as Google struggled with low-quality apps over the years, Facebook's ecosystem quickly became bogged down with poorly produced chatbots. Badly made bots could annoy customers and tarnish a company's image -- so the company decided it's a better idea to send the bots back to the drawing board than expand the overall ecosystem.

Facebook should've seen this coming

The limitations of AI-powered bots were already clear when Facebook launched its chatbot APIs last year. For example, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) launched its chatbot Tay on Twitter as an experiment last March. Within 24 hours, Tay started tweeting racist and sexist comments, forcing Microsoft to abruptly pull the plug and issue an apology. Tencent has also struggled to purge spam and scam bots on WeChat since it started letting millions of accounts create their own bots.

Facebook's AI tech also wasn't that impressive prior to the arrival of its chatbots. Its News Feed struggled to discern fake news headlines from real ones, and its Messenger-based virtual assistant M hasn't gained much ground against Google Now or Siri.

Edison Investment analyst Richard Windsor -- who recently called Facebook a ""laggard in AI"" compared to Google -- stated that ""when Facebook tries to automate its systems, things always go wrong."" He also pointed out that while Facebook has hired plenty of AI talent, it simply hasn't been working on AI ""for nearly long enough"" to challenge market leaders like Google.

So what's next for Facebook's AI efforts?

Despite those missteps, Facebook probably won't stop investing in chatbots anytime soon. The company is expected to introduce new AI plans at its F8 conference in April, which will likely include ways to boost the quality, not quantity, of its Messenger bots. It could also introduce more ways to tether bots into other Messenger features -- like payments and games -- to increase the app's appeal as a stand-alone platform.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Reporting by Lisa Richwine in Los Angeles and Julia Love in San Francisco)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2/28/2017,0.538497786,0.156310146,825.61,828.54,820.2,823.21,2260769,8.34,-2.4,0,"These two are in rare company. How many other organizations have ruled the age of the internet quite like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) or Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)? We spend countless hours on each site keeping up with friends and binge-watching our favorite shows.

In fact, with the addition of Alphabet and Amazon, I think we'd be hard-pressed to find more influential companies in today's society. That fact has not been lost on investors. Over the past four years, both stocks have quintupled in value.

But which is a better buy today? That's a difficult question to answer, though we can get a better understanding for what we're buying by looking at the question through three different lenses.

Sustainable competitive advantages

If I had one word of advice for beginning investors, it would be this: Spend the bulk of your time investigating a company's sustainable competitive advantages. Often referred to as a ""moat"" by investors, sustainable competitive advantages are what keep customers coming back for more every year and consistently keep the competition at bay.

Netflix benefits from, as I see it, three different types of moats. The first is the brand. The Qwikster fiasco not withstanding, the company has won over legions of loyal customers who appreciate the service and its original content. That original content is key, as it is gets people hooked into the Netflix ecosystem.

Management is able to target its original content because it has more data on our viewing habits than any other organization in the history of the world. That also gives the company the upper hand when it comes to paying for content from third-party providers. Imagine the negotiating table: Netflix knows just how popular certain shows are to its viewers and how valuable it is. The other side has no idea. That asymmetry provides pricing power.

Finally, Netflix benefits from a sneaky type of moat I only recently came to appreciate. Once customers sign on, the cost of the monthly plan is so low -- and the payments fully automated -- that a user would have to be highly motivated to cancel his/her membership.

Facebook, on the other hand, benefits from one of the most powerful moats in the world: the network effect. With each additional member who joins Facebook, non-members are incentivized to join as a way of keeping up with their friends and family. It's a virtuous cycle that is in full effect. Even though the company already has over 1 billion daily active users, its roster continues to grow -- up 18% year over year.

Not only that but Facebook gets essentially all of its content for free. That's often underappreciated by investors. Imagine what a boon it would be if Netflix never had to pay for its shows.

At the end of the day, both of these companies have powerful moats. In years past, I would have given the nod to Facebook. But my realization of how easy it is for Netflix to keep subscribers -- and how effective original content is at bringing in new users -- is enough to call this a draw.

Winner = Tie

Financial fortitude

While conservative investors love seeing cash returned to them via dividends and more aggressive investors love seeing cash reinvested in a company's growth prospects, there's something to be said for cash.

Every company will experience difficult financial times, and the companies that enter those phases with lots of cash will prosper. They will have the flexibility to outspend rivals and gain market share, repurchase stock on the cheap, and even make strategic acquisitions. Debt-laden companies will be in the opposite boat, forced to satisfy the whims of their creditors.

Company Cash Debt Net Income Free Cash Flow Netflix $1.7 billion $3.4 billion $0.2 billion ($1.6 billion) Facebook $30 billion $0 $10.2 billion $11.6 billion

Here, we have a very clear winner. Netflix is spending lots of cash on its international expansion and original programing. That's a great strategy because, as mentioned above, once customers are locked in, they're a reliable source of recurring revenue.

But with that strategy comes financial fragility. Netflix is free cash flow negative, while Facebook is a cash machine with no long-term debt whatsoever.

Winner = Facebook

Valuation

Finally, we have valuation. While this isn't an exact science, there are some straightforward metrics we can consult to give us an idea of how expensive each stock is.

Company P/E P/FCF PEG Ratio Netflix 340 N/A 1.6 Facebook 32 34 1.1

Here again, we have a clear winner. Because of the aforementioned spending, Netflix is very expensive based on traditional metrics.

Facebook, on the other hand, looks like a pretty good deal at today's prices. While a P/E of 32 would never be described as ""cheap,"" the company increased earnings by 86% last year, and is expected to grow by 28% moving forward.

Winner = Facebook

The winner is...

So there you have it: While both companies have powerful moats, Facebook has a better balance sheet and appears to be a better value at today's prices. You really can't go wrong by investing in either, but I'm a much stronger fan of Facebook at today's levels. That helps explain why it accounts for 14% of my real-life holdings, while Netflix clocks in at just 2%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DETROIT (Reuters) - California-based Starsky Robotics said on Tuesday it has a solution to on- and off-highway deliveries by self-driving trucks, including the ""last mile"" issue for how a driverless vehicle will deliver cargo at its final destination.

In an interview, Starsky founder and Chief Executive Stefan Seltz-Axmacher said the company's goal is to employ robotics, sensors and software to ""make trucks completely driverless.""

The trucking industry is keenly following efforts to automate various aspects of big trucks, in part to address highway safety concerns as well as the growing shortage of skilled drivers. As with self-driving cars, federal and state regulators have not finalized new rules covering self-driving trucks.

Other startups, while developing similar self-driving systems, have said they plan to keep a ""safety"" driver in the vehicle, even when in autonomous driving mode.

""Our remote drivers will pilot trucks from the door of the distribution center to the highway, then remotely engage the autonomous system,"" Seltz-Axmacher said. ""When the truck gets close to the off-ramp, another remote driver will take control of the vehicle"" to its final destination.

Seltz-Axmacher said Starsky already has begun testing its system and expects to ""remove human drivers from certain vehicles by the end of the year.""

Both Starsky and Embark Technologies -- the former Varden Labs which came out of stealth last Friday -- are funded mainly by venture capital firms, many of them based in Silicon Valley.

Starsky and Embark follow Peloton Technology, another Silicon Valley startup focused on self-driving trucks. Founded in 2011 and based in Mountain View, Peloton is funded in part by Swedish heavy truck maker Volvo AB and logistics giant United Parcel Service.

Those startups could wind up competing with Tesla Inc, whose Chief Executive Elon Musk has said he plans to expand Tesla's product range to include self-driving trucks and buses.

Last week, another self-driving truck startup was at the center of a lawsuit filed by Google parent Alphabet Inc, whose Waymo self-driving car unit accused ride services startup Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and its autonomous trucking subsidiary Otto of trade theft.

Uber acquired Otto, founded by two former Google executives, last summer.

It’s the biggest cloud-services provider, with data centers around the world that handle the computing power for many large companies, such as Netflix Inc. and Capital One Corp. Amazon and competitors Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. are growing their cloud computing businesses as customers find it more efficient to shift their data storage and computer functions to the cloud rather than maintaining those functions on their own. The shift also increases the likelihood that problems with one service can have sweeping ramifications online.

While it was a surprise to many, we profited from seeing it coming. Just recently, I wrote several strategies to go long AAPL stock, and they have all paid well and without trouble.

Twelve days ago, I wrote about how you can profit from owning AAPL or trading it. This was in addition to last month’s $5 profit per contract out of thin air trading Apple stock when it had appeared to be too late.

Today, I want to repeat the success I’ve had trading AAPL stock long. But this time I am doing it in a smaller account, so I will use credit put spreads instead of selling naked puts.

How to Trade AAPL Stock

The Bet: Sell the AAPL Oct $110/$105 credit put spread. This is a bullish trade for which I collect 55 cents per contract to open. The 20% buffer from current price gives me a 90% theoretical chance of success. If Apple shares stay above $110 per share, the trade will yield 12% on money risk.

Usually I like to balance my trades by selling opposite bearish risk, but in this case I will refrain. I will count on the Warren Buffett effect that long-term AAPL is a hold. Buyers should step in on down weeks and defend the stock for me.

I could sell credit call spreads in the PowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (ETF) (NASDAQ: QQQ ) to create some balance, but I don’t feel it’s necessary at this time.

Earlier, I noted that I like selling naked puts in sure things like AAPL and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ). So I will offer the trade, but I only do this if I am willing and able to own the stock at the strike sold.

The Alternate: Sell the AAPL Oct $105 put naked. This is a bullish trade for which I collect $1.25 per contract to open. My breakeven point is $103.75 per share. Anything lower would accrue losses for me.

If AAPL stock falls below my sold strike, I would be put the stock at that price even if it’s much lower. Therein lies the open-ended risk unlike that of a credit put spread.

I am not required to hold trades through expiration. I can close either of them for partial gains or losses at any time.

Sure, every now and then, events spice things up. Recently, AT&T and Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ ) have been eating crow over their attacks against T-Mobile US Inc (NASDAQ: TMUS ). VZ has received the brunt of T-Mobile’s counterpunches, but its CEO, John Legere, is no stranger to controversy. That’s likely to put T stock on the cover of a gossip magazine as it is on The Wall Street Journal.

But for the most part, AT&T is a big hulking mass of old money. The drama surrounding VZ is entertaining to watch, and near-unanimous support by Time Warner Inc (NYSE: TWX ) shareholders of a proposed TWX-T merger is newsworthy.

Then again, it’s sort of expected. Wake me up when the Department of Justice approves the deal.

On the flip side, T stock has proved it has still got some moves. Last year, T shares returned 30%. Compare that to the vaunted “FANG” stocks.

On average, Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG ,NASDAQ: GOOGL ) combined for a little less than 12% in 2016. At the top of the FANG spectrum was AMZN, which turned in a performance just shy of 18%.

So there you have it — AT&T stock took down almighty Amazon.

Of course, I’m being a bit facetious. If the market gods gave investors a freebie, I’d be shocked if anyone would choose AT&T stock. The reason is obvious. Every dog has its day, and 2016 just happened to be one of the good years for T stock. Back to planet Earth, in the three years between 2013 and the end of 2015, the company only managed a pedestrian 4.8% average.

The Math Looks Good for T stock

Depending on your investment strategy, though, pedestrian just might do the trick. Here’s a good test to see if AT&T stock is right for you. If you’re still trying to figure out why your VCR flashes “12:00” all the time, congratulations! Mr. T is your right-hand man.

I’m just half-joking here. InvestorPlace Contributor Lawrence Meyers rightfully declared that AT&T stock is a dividend behemoth. Indeed, he has no reservations, writing, “for this investor, buying AT&T stock is really just to get the 4.76% dividend.” I appreciate Meyers’ candor because it’s funny, and more importantly, he’s spot on.

Just look at your cards. AT&T stock in its present form began trading towards the tail end of 1983. Lifetime, T stock is averaging returns of 12.7% — probably not what you were expecting. However, much of that growth occurred in its initial phase. Up to 1999, AT&T turned in 20.5%. From 2000 to the end of 2016, it’s a much more humble 4.8%.

Japan’s Softbank Group Corp (OTCMKTS: SFTBF ) is reportedly willing to cede its controlling interest in S to Deutsche Telekom AG (ADR) (OTCMKTS: DTEGY ), which controls T-Mobile.

SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son, spent $20.1 billion to buy a controlling stake in Sprint a few years ago. The wireless provider’s market cap now tops $36 billion, so it makes sense that the billionaire may be looking for an exit strategy.

What’s Going on With Sprint and T-Mobile?

Interestingly, news of the potential deal was leaked during the critical Federal Communications Commission spectrum auction where merger discussions are forbidden, so it remains unclear whether this is a trial balloon.

Of course, the wildcard in this mix is TMUS’ colorful CEO John Legere.

Legere certainly deserves credit for shaking up the wireless industry through innovative marketing, such as paying the early termination fees for customers who switch their service before their service contract expires.

He is far from foolish and loves the spotlight, taking delight in needling his rivals, including Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure. It would make sense that Legere would want to run a merged company. If for some reason, Legere wasn’t a top dog, he would collect a payday of nearly $65 million if TMUS were sold, according to its latest proxy.

Legere’s winning way with words can change the fact that the wireless market is becoming increasingly commoditized as new entrants, including Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA ), Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google and Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ: CHTR ), squeeze margins of incumbents such as T-Mobile, S, AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T ) and Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ ).

Jeff Bezos Is the Unbeatable Edge of AMZN Stock

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock hit a high of $848.64 on Monday and appears to be gradually inching toward another record closing.

“Amazon Studios” just won three Oscars at the 89th Academy Awards, and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos couldn’t be happier. There are many factors supporting AMZN stock, but the most important one is its chief, Bezos.

Even Warren Buffett acknowledges this fact. While the world has been going crazy over Buffett buying Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and airline stocks, the more important story turned out to be the one stock that he missed buying.

During an interview with CNBC, the billionaire investor reflected that he really missed the boat on Amazon. He said, “Obviously, I should have bought it long ago,” but he added, “I didn’t understand the power of the model.” (Source: “Warren Buffett on Amazon: ‘I don’t have a good answer’ on why I didn’t buy it long ago,” CNBC, February 27, 2017.)

He was full of praise for the Amazon founder and CEO, whom he called a “terrific businessperson.” The business acumen of Jeff Bezos is what has transformed an online book seller to an e-commerce and technology powerhouse of today, pushing Amazon stock to $800.00-plus levels.

Bezos is never out of great ideas to push Amazon’s growth higher. “Amazon Prime” membership is the best example of this. The privileges that come with a Prime subscription are hard to ignore and, given the competitive pricing, it is hard for customers to not opt for one. The growing number of Prime memberships good proof of this, and has done magic to the impressive rise of AMZN stock.

“Amazon Alexa” was another masterstroke by Jeff Bezos, and the surprise success of the company’s “Echo” line of speakers left many impressed. At a time when everybody thought that Google parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) would be the leader in digital assistants, Amazon Alexa-powered Echo speakers took the market by storm.

I wrote earlier in Profit Confidential that Amazon Alexa is one of the top reasons to remain bullish on Amazon stock. And, being the super businessperson that he is, Bezos understands that Amazon Alexa needs to be ready as the battle with “Google Assistant” heats up in the near future.

Amazon.com has been taking steps to do just that. Amazon Alexa already supports almost 10,000 skills, with the number likely to climb up further. At the Consumer Electronics Show this year (CES 2017), a number of firms in electronics and household appliances announced their product integration with Alexa. And now another piece of good news come from the 2017 Mobile World Congress (MWC).

Motorola has picked Amazon Alexa as its voice assistant. The company has announced a partnership with Amazon that will see the latter’s voice assistant tech embedded natively into most of Motorola’s devices in the future. (Source: “Motorola picks Amazon’s Alexa as its voice assistant,” TechCrunch, February 26, 2017.)

Speaking at a press conference at the MWC trade show in Barcelona, Dan Dery, Motorola’s VP global product lead, said, “Later this year will see deep integration of Alexa wake-up words. There won’t be any keys to press, no screen to unlock – you will simply talk to Alexa when the device is around.” He further added that Alexa would be coming to most of their devices. (Source: Ibid.)

There are also reports that Google Assistant is coming soon on millions of new “Android” devices. Even though Google has an upper hand in search capabilities, it would be interesting to see who emerges as the winner in this battle.

Amazon is betting big on the Alexa platform, and is not leaving any stone unturned to make it the best. Alexa is expected to be a big boost for the company and AMZN stock. The latest piece of news confirms this.

According to TIME Magazine, the online retail giant is developing advanced voice recognition for Alexa. Amazon has been developing a feature that would allow its voice assistant to distinguish between individual users based on their voices, according to people familiar with the company’s Alexa strategy. (Source: “Exclusive: Amazon Developing Advanced Voice-Recognition for Alexa,” TIME, February 27, 2017.)

So far, none of the well-known voice-enabled smart speakers have been able to distinguish who in a family is asking for something. Amazon’s new feature would match the person speaking to a voice sample, or “voice print,” to verify a person’s identity, according to TIME‘s source.

A user could set it so a parent’s voice would be required to make a credit card purchase. This capability is internally named as “Voice ID.” Distinguishing different voices of family members could be a big relief for parents as accidental shopping incidents could be minimized. While Echo speakers currently let the users build multiple profiles, the Voice ID feature would allow them to access their accounts without the need to switch between them or use Alexa app for the same.

The technology has been completed; it’s just a matter of integrating the feature into Echo products, said one of TIME’s sources. Voice ID could give the Echo a competitive edge against rival “Google Home” and could be a game changer for Amazon stock.

And to end it all on a high note, Amazon’s Manchester by the Sea and The Salesman won three Oscars on Sunday night. Manchester by the Sea won for Best Actor and Best Original Screenplay whereas The Salesman won the Oscar for the Best Foreign Film. Jeff Bezos was present at the ceremony and tweeted his congratulations to the winners.

It was a historic achievement for the streaming industry as Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) also won its first Oscar for the documentary The White Helmets. Although Netflix has received Oscar nominations in the past, the streaming giant has never been nominated in the Best Picture category.

With Manchester by the Sea, Amazon took a different approach from other services by releasing the film in traditional theaters before its streaming debut. Amazon reportedly paid $10.0 million for the rights to the movie at the Sundance Film Festival a year ago. The film debuted in November and is set for release on Amazon in May. (Source: “Amazon wins 3 Oscars in a first for streaming audio – and Jeff Bezos gets a fun shout-out,” GeekWire, February 26, 2017.)

With the strength and potential of “Amazon Prime Video” and Amazon Alexa, both Jeff Bezos and Amazon stock are likely to grab headlines in the coming days. AMZN stock has returned 53% over the last year—as compared to the S&P 500 Index that posted 24% gains in the same time period—and will likely continue inching upwards. Investors have a lot to look forward to this year, and Bezos is expected to be at the top of his game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The source also told the publication that the Mountain View company is testing lower-end Pixel devices.

Google’s major focus is to improve the Pixel 2’s camera technology, according to the source. Specifically, the company is aiming to master low light photography with the next-generation device.

Candlesticks

A big white candle occurred. This is generally considered bullish, as prices closed significantly higher than they opened. If the candle appears when prices are “low,” it may be the first sign of a bottom. If it occurs when prices are rebounding off of a support area (e.g., a moving average, trendline, or retracement level), the long white candle adds credibility to the support. Similarly, if the candle appears during a breakout above a resistance area, the long white candle adds credibility to the breakout.

During the past 10 bars, there have been 9 white candles and 1 black candles for a net of 8 white candles. During the past 50 bars, there have been 28 white candles and 22 black candles for a net of 6 white candles.

Three white candles occurred in the last three days. Although these candles were not big enough to create three white soldiers, the steady upward pattern is bullish.

Relative Strength Index (RSI)

The RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas. The current value of the RSI is 64.06. This is not a topping or bottoming area. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a sell 20 period(s) ago.

Commodity Channel Index (CCI)

The CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is 68. This is not a topping or bottoming area. The last signal was a sell 2 period(s) ago.

Startups may be a source of tremendous innovation. But of course, old-line companies can too. Just look at Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ). Launched in 1993, the company's co-founders - which included tech veterans like Jen-Hsun Huang (now the CEO), Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem - saw a great opportunity to develop graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming market.

Source: via Nvidia

While growth was strong, there was always skepticism. Was the market big enough?

Well, of course, we know that GPUs have proven to be quite versatile, having applications in diverse areas like AI (artificial intelligence), self-driving cars, VR (virtual reality) and the Internet of Things (IoT). The main reason is that this core technology can process huge amounts of data on a cost-effective basis.

And yes, Wall Street has certainly caught on to this. During the past year, NVDA stock is up a sizzling 200%-plus.

But what now? Is it still a good time to buy NVDA stock? Or should investors wait for a better valuation?

Breaking Down NVDA Stock

First of all, there are signs that the momentum is losing some of its steam. For the year so far, the stock is down 5% after back-to-back downgrades in the past week. This is despite the fact that the overall markets have been extremely bullish, with the Nasdaq up about 8.5%.

In fact, since reaching an all-time high in early February, Nvidia stock has since fallen by 14%.

Perhaps the most interesting thing has been the muted response from wall Street from the company's most recent earnings report . Revenues soared 55% to $2.17 billion and adjusted earnings came to $1.13 per share, up from 94 cents for the same period a year ago. Wall Street, on the other hand, was looking for $2.11 billion in revenues and earnings of 83 cents.

For the most part, there was really nothing to complain about. It was, well, nearly a perfect performance.

Yet NVDA stock fell by about 2.4% on the news.

Then again, it seems that the good news is already baked into the valuation - and then some. Consider that the forward price-to-earnings ratio on NVDA stock is at 30X. By comparison, Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) trades at 20X and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ) sports a multiple of 22X. No doubt, the NVDA stock valuation makes other traditional chip operators look almost embarrassing. Keep in mind that Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC ) and Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM ) both trade at about 12X.

Interestingly enough, Wall Street analysts are getting a little antsy about the valuation for NVDA stock as well. Note that the average price target is at $113.59. This implies only a 7% gain from current levels.

For example, Roth Capital Partners analyst Brian Alger downgraded his rating on NVDA stock from ""buy"" to ""neutral"" recently. Yes, his biggest concern is the valuation.

Besides, the year-over-year comparisons on revenues and earnings will not get any easier for the company. If there is even a slight miss or sign of deceleration, it seems reasonable that there could be a sell-off. Might as well take profits after NVDA stock has provided substantial gains, right?

Certainly.

Another potential issue is the competition. Let's face it, rival Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD ) has been making nice strides with its own graphics systems. As seen with the latest earnings report, the company looks poised for a growth spurt - and this may come at the expense of NVDA. Of course, investors have been buying up AMD stock, which is up around 600% during the past year.

Now, this is in no way to diminish NVDIA's outstanding technology and the potential growth opportunities. Hey, just with autos, the addressable market could be at least $10 trillion (this is based on recent NVDA investor presentation ).

But for now, there probably should be caution. For the most part, NVDA stock is probably due for a cooling-off period. Yet this should be good news, since it may mean that investors who missed the first big move could get a second chance on the stock.

Mobile World Congress is the industry's largest event for smartphone launches. Everyone who's anyone is there -unless your company name is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ).

Source: BlackBerry

MWC 2017 officially started today, but the big announcements took place over the weekend.

And in many ways, they set the stage for the coming battle for best smartphone that will pit Apple's 10th anniversary iPhone 8 and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's (OTCMKTS: SSNLF ) comeback Galaxy S8 against everyone else.

Here's what you need to know about MWC 2017 .

Cutting Edge New Smartphones

Mobile World Congress is the venue where many manufacturers choose to launch their new smartphones. That means the trends are set for what to expect in the coming year. At MWC 2017, there have been a few standouts that lead to some interesting conclusions.

LG's new G6 smartphone is one of the most talked about releases. The company abandoned the modular design it introduced in last year's G5. The new G6 incorporates design elements expected in the iPhone 8, with a glass front and back held together with a stainless-steel band.

While bezels are still there, they're been minimized by moving the power button and fingerprint sensor to the back. The result is a 5.7-inch display in a compact body - and the display is wowing with its 564 ppi pixel density and support for HDR. The LG G6 also has a dual lens 13 megapixel camera, but unlike the iPhone 7 Plus, the extra lens is wide angle rather than telephone.

Another interesting flagship release is the P10 from China's Huawei . This new premium smartphone includes Leica -branded cameras and a Portrait Mode to compete with iPhone 7 Plus feature. In addition, the P10 uses Huawei's own processor, the Kirin 960. This is bad news for Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM ), which is seeing more smartphone makers follow the lead of Apple by ditching the Snapdragon to develop their own customized chips.

When the iPhone 8 arrives in the fall, its expected all-glass design isn't going to be as unique as Apple might have hoped. Cameras are going to be a big battleground, too, putting pressure on Apple to go further than it did with the dual-lens iPhone 7 Plus.

No Galaxy S8 at MWC 2017

Samsung traditionally unveils its new Galaxy S smartphones at Mobile World Congress. Not this year. Delayed by the Galaxy Note 7 battery investigation, Samsung is expected to unveil the Galaxy S8 at an event on March 29.

The company did take the wraps off two new tablets , though. The Galaxy Tab S3 and Galaxy Book. The latter is offered in two different sizes, runs Windows 10, comes with a snap-on keyboard case and stylus and is aimed at Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Surface Pro.

Google Assistant Coming to Android Nougat and Marshmallow Devices

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) has had a big decision to make since introducing Google Assistant. The company broke with tradition to make its new AI-powered digital assistant exclusive to its own Google Pixel smartphones. But that restriction means the number of phones running Google Assistant are outnumbered by Siri-powered Apple devices and Amazon.com,Inc.'s (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Alexa-powered smart speakers.

Google chose MWC 2017 to announce it's decided to go back to the strategy of volume over exclusivity. Google Assistant will start rolling out to devices running Android Nougat and Marshmallow starting this week.

BlackBerry and Nokia Makes a Splash at MWC 2017

If you'd asked anyone a few months ago what companies would be generating buzz at MWC 2017, it's doubtful that BlackBerry Ltd (NASDAQ: BBRY ) or Nokia Corp (ADR) (NYSE: NOK ) would be anywhere on that list. But they both pulled it off. Sort of.

BlackBerry's last hurrah in smartphones is the new BlackBerry KeyOne . The last phone with the company's name on it that was designed in-house combines Android with a classic BlackBerry keyboard. There's grumbling about the $549 price, but a general feeling that had BBRY released this phone a few years ago, it might still be relevant in the smartphone space.

The other big surprise was the return of the Nokia brand. Finland's HMD Global bought the rights to use the Nokia name on phones, and at MWC 2017 it announced three new Nokia Android smartphones aimed at the Chinese market.

The company is also bringing back the classic Nokia 3310 cell phone. Considered to be virtually indestructible, the Nokia 3310 was first released in 2000 and sold over 126 million units . The new version is a little less sturdy, but has new colors, and updated display and runs just over $50.

Nokia gets some licensing revenue out of this, but was not involved in the development of the new phones bearing its brand.

Everyone Against the iPhone 8

The announcements from MWC 2017 largely set the stage for the coming battle for smartphone supremacy. Samsung still must take the wraps off the Galaxy S8, but after that happens, we'll largely know what Apple's iPhone 8 will be up against.

It looks like Apple's 10th anniversary iPhone will face a strong field with large displays, impressive cameras, Google Assistant on board and new designs - at least some of which follow the direction Apple is expected to take.

Who will have the best smartphone of 2017? With the big Mobile World Congress reveals over with, the ball is now in Samsung and Apple's court.

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) has taken on some unexpected targets lately. None more ambitious - and unforeseen - than sticking its Alexa personal assistant in the Amazon Echo smart speaker.

Source: Amazon

That move has paid off with a big lead in the race to become the hub of the smart home, despite AMZN's complete lack of smartphone presence.

Per a report in The Information , Amazon is readying another bold move. If sources are correct, AMZN is preparing to take on Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Microsoft Office and Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google G Suite with its own cloud-based productivity suite.

Report: Amazon.com Is Working on a Productivity Suite

The Information broke the news that Amazon.com is working on its own productivity suite to take on Microsoft and Google. The website says AMZN's Amazon Web Services - AWS - unit has told some of its ""large corporate customers"" of its plans to offer a new suite of productivity apps that will compete against the two dominant players.

Microsoft Office has always been considered a cash cow for the company. The productivity suite quickly became the industry standard, the applications of choice for enterprise, schools and home PC users. To make its software seem more affordable, to break free of the boom bust cycle between major versions of Microsoft Office, and to address the growing threat of Google's free Google Apps suite, five years ago, the company began pushing Office 365.

This subscription version of Microsoft Office brought recurring monthly revenue and other advantages. Microsoft expanded into Office apps for mobile devices like Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPad and began to sell online storage for Office 365 users, with OneDrive.

Google Apps/G Suite

Google wasn't sitting still, though, refining Google Apps into G Suite , a full-on competitor to Office 365, with paid monthly subscription plans and online storage options. The company has also leveraged Google Apps and its lightweight Chrome OS into Chromebooks - ultra-low-cost laptops that have been giving Microsoft fits, especially in the education market.

That education market is where the potential for disruption is really playing out. With its free Google Apps and low-cost Chromebooks, Google upended the education market. By the end of 2015, more than half of all device in U.S. classrooms were Chromebooks . This has repercussions beyond the classroom, as those students turn into young professionals who are more comfortable with Google's productivity software than with Microsoft Office.

I've seen the effect first hand. My kids do everything at school using G Suite, despite Microsoft offering free Office 365 subscriptions to students and computer labs full of Windows PCs. They ignore Microsoft Office and Apple's Pages/Numbers on our home computers, and instead log onto G Suite for doing homework.

If Google could quickly make waves in one of Microsoft's key strongholds, why couldn't Amazon.com march in and disrupt both companies?

Why Amazon Would Take On Microsoft Office

This is a key question. Taking on the Google and Apple in the smart home with the Amazon Echo made sense because the smart speaker was a Trojan horse. It offers a growing number of ""Skills"" that let it control other smart devices by voice command, or interact with online services.

That ropes consumers into buying it. But Alexa is a voice-activated path to effortlessly order products directly from Amazon.com, and gives an incentive to buy other Amazon products and services like Amazon Music Unlimited and Amazon Fire TV.

Where's the win for AMZN in offering productivity software, other than to tweak Microsoft and Google?

For the answer, look to AWS. Amazon Web Services dominates the market for cloud infrastructure and the profit from this division is a big driver of Amazon's overall growth. Amazon already has the servers in place and it has several of the components needed for a productivity suite, including its WorkDocs and WorkMail apps and the recently announced Amazon Chime video conferencing software. Stitch these together with a few additional components and Amazon could have its Microsoft Office and Google G Suite competitor.

Google charges $5 to $10 per month for G Suite, while Microsoft Office 365 has several tiered options starting at $5.99 per month.

AMZN could charge a competitive rate for its new offering, adding more subscription-based revenue to its bottom line while taking advantage of its existing cloud muscle. The base monthly fee could be supplemented by charging for additional online storage for enterprise customers - something it has plenty of.

Productivity software could also become another free perk of Prime membership. Prime members that start using Amazon's productivity software could put pressure on their employers to invest in a subscription, in an effect like Google's approach that sees students graduate and look to their employers to provide G Suite access.

AMZN isn't commenting and The Information's sources say all of this is still in the early stages, but the move makes sense. Amazon has been aggressively expanding beyond its role as an online retailer, AWS has the infrastructure needed to support the initiative, the company has been creeping into enterprise software with apps like WorkMail, and Google proved that the Microsoft Office behemoth isn't invulnerable. A productivity software suite from Amazon.com could well be the company's next big thing.

As if investors needed another reason to own Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK.A , NYSE: BRK.B ) stock, Warren Buffett's gone and done just that. You'd have to be living under a rock somewhere not to be aware of the fact Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) became the world's most valuable company in early February; the first to surpass $700 billion in market cap enriching all those owning Apple stock.

Source: Pete Souza via Wikimedia (Modified)

Only months ago, Apple was passed by Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) as the world's most valuable company, but since then, AAPL stock has gone on a huge run, up 52% since May 12, 2016, the day the two companies switched roles.

By comparison, GOOGL stock is up 16% in the same period. A respectable performance - 200 basis points better than the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA: SPY ) - but not enough to keep it in the top spot.

Why AAPL Stock Gives Berkshire Hathaway a Big Boost

Apparently, Warren Buffett and/or his two money managers - Todd Combs and Ted Weschler - were buying heavily in the fourth quarter of the year. At the end of Q3 2016, BRK.B held 15.2 million shares of Apple stock; by the end of the year that ballooned 268.2% to 57.4 million shares, a stake currently worth $7.8 billion through Feb. 23.

As a result of this buying binge, Berkshire Hathaway is one of AAPL's 10 largest shareholders owning 1.1% of Apple stock. Of greater importance to BRK.B stock owners is the fact AAPL stock is now its sixth largest equity position representing 5% of the entire portfolio and not too far off Berkshire's investment in International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM ), which accounts for 9% of the equity portfolio.

It's amazing to think that Buffett didn't own any tech stocks in 2011 when he started buying IBM and now these two businesses represent one-seventh of Berkshire Hathaway's $148 billion equity portfolio.

So, if diversification is your thing, Buffett's move into Apple stock is just another reason why you might want to own BRK.B stock.

Sure, the company is firing on all cylinders, not to mention AAPL stock is still relatively cheap at 16 times earnings or about 25% lower than the S&P 500 , but those iPhone sales have a way of going sideways at a moments notice.

Remember the first half of 2016?

It wasn't all peaches and cream as investors fretted about Apple's continuing sales slowdown. Ebbs and flows are common in the tech business. Holding AAPL stock within the Berkshire Hathaway fortress allows you to benefit from Apple's good times without suffering as much when it gets its next tech flu - and it will.

A recent Marketwatcharticle discussed possible acquisition candidates for Apple's $200 billion in cash should Trump lower the tax it would pay to repatriate the money sitting in foreign bank accounts.

While those inside AAPL, including its head of content, Eddy Cue, can't envision a large acquisition that would make sense for the company, one potential media company does come to mind - Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: SIRI ).

Why SIRI?

It's a business that's predictable, generates annual free cash flow of more than $1.5 billion and continues to grow the top- and bottom-line.

Bottom Line on BRK.B Stock

More importantly, Buffett bought 166 million shares of its stock in the fourth quarter to go along with shares already held in Liberty Media's SiriusXM tracking stock. Combining Apple Music with SiriusXM satellite radio wouldn't be the worse move in the world.

Heck, by owning Berkshire Hathaway you get a small piece of a lot of pies including Apple.

I'm not the first person to say this about BRK.B stock, but it really is the ultimate mutual fund/exchange-traded fund/hedge fund/private equity fund all wrapped up into one nice, shiny package.

PREFACE

The cloud revolution is coming, and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is openly going after the two leaders: Amazon Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).

STORY

While the cloud has become more like a colloquialism than a name for a technology, the tailwinds to this technological shift are simply unstoppable at this point. There is too much data and too many connected devices even today, not to speak of the absurdity that is to come, to not have a machine learning driven technology to balance the needs of every website, every app, all the data in complete harmony. Enter the cloud.

The worldwide public cloud market is forecast to rise from $154 billion this year to nearly half a trillion dollars by 2026. Right now, there are two distinct leaders. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the undisputed leader and right behind the e-commerce giant is Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Here is a market share chart:

(Source: SkyHighNetworks.com)

While the mainstream media will talk about the battle between Amazon.com and Microsoft Corporation, the third place company is none other than Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and while trailing, let us never forget that it is the second largest company in the world, it relies heavily on its search advertising business, and it is getting aggressive about diversifying that revenue stream and that could be a serious risk to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).

ALPHABET INC

While digital advertising is the kingpin in Google's empire, the segment is finally showing slowing growth as echoed by both Alphabet Inc and Facebook. Even further, Google's search revenue is seeing increased competition from mobile search.

Add to that the very clear intentions of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) with its voice activated Siri, and we have the makings of trouble. But, of course, Alphabet Inc is ahead of the curve, not behind it.

Quietly Google has submitted some of the most impressive, if not bizarre, patent filings with respect to data hosting and the cloud. Here is one rendering:

Google may be taking the technology behind cloud computing to the absolute ends of human knowledge. Another under reported story revealed that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) moved half a billion dollars of business away from Amazon.com's cloud (AWS) to Google last year in what we assume is the beginning of a competitive stance that Apple will take by entering the cloud business itself.

Now that Alphabet has broken out a segment of the company that is dedicated to the growing needs of the cloud called ""The Google Cloud,"" the company's intentions are rather clear.

ANALYTICS AND MACHINE LEARNING

In 2015, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) brought in the co-founder of VMware, Diane Greene, to head its cloud segment. She recently spoke at a Goldman Sachs conference and said this:

The enterprise has to lean into data and that's what Google was built for. With machine learning and data analytics, we're in the sweet spot of where enterprise customers are going.

While Wall Street has bemoaned Alphabet Inc's late entry and their apparent lack of a competitive advantage to AMZN and MSFT, when taken as a holistic entity, we could argue that there is no company better suited to deliver unparalleled analytics and there is certainly an argument that no company has done as much as quickly as Alphabet Inc has done with machine learning and artificial intelligence, save for chip marvel Nvidia.

With Amazon pulling about 60% of its operating income from its cloud business, even though it makes up less than 10% of revenue, the cloud war is going to be a critical one.

A BETTER BET

As the tech titans war over the cloud business, and that includes what feels like an inevitable entry by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), there's another way to play this thematic revolution in technology. Behind every cloud, every connected computer, is a routing and switching system. It sounds boring, but this is the business that Cisco has turned into a $150 billion market cap.

But there's a new player -- a young, sparkling technology company that just crossed $1 billion in revenue, and this company is the pick-axe to the cloud computing gold rush. In all the haste to pick a cloud winner, don't forget the company that aims to power every cloud, irrespective of the tech giant that owns it.

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is positioning itself to enter into one of the world's largest and most competitive industries. The road to success is fraught with hazards and the potential reward is huge. Apple has built one of the strongest brands in history, turning electronic devices into status symbols through their brilliant marketing, design aesthetic, and reputation for dependability.Now they will put their brand and technology prowess to the test as they plunge into the market of the world's most recognized status symbol: The Luxury Automobile.Their brand and a substantial portion of their $750 billion market cap hangs in the balance.We start by capturing what is publicly known or widely believed about the Apple Car project, code-named ""Titan"":The automotive industry is one of the world's largest markets, with luxury cars alone accounting for $360 billion per year in sales and growing fast:The electric vehicle market weighed in at over $80 billion in 2012 and is projected to hit greater than $270 billion by 2019:The world's largest vehicle producer is, surprisingly to American car owners, Volkswagen, with global sales of over 200 billion euros per year, followed closely by Toyota (source: Statista). Put in perspective, Volkswagen has roughly the same total revenue as Apple's $240 billion USD. A successful launch for Apple could realistically double revenues, and with time, operating margins and substantial new profits would be sure to follow.The risk to Apple's brand if the car launch is unsuccessful is enormous. In 2010 an antenna problem with the iPhone 4 was a recoverable embarrassment. In the automotive realm, any mishap could have dire consequences. When Tesla was a little known startup with grand ideas, they were able to survive several batteries catching fire. Serious, potentially dangerous problems with the Apple Car would likely have far broader implications with down-stream effects across the Apple ecosystem.The most obvious competition comes from Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), which is a company that created an unbelievably strong brand. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) will have to grapple with the reality that in the automotive space, there is a brand that is tied to technology that is going to be a burden to overcome, even for the mighty mac maker.The competition also sprawls into the makers of the brain of a self-driving car -- and that means Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Waymo.For the longest time this project felt like one of the many moonshots that would never really see the light of day - that's what Wall Street would have had us think, at least. But it isn't a moonshot, it's a business - and a rather large one.No company is better positioned to make a huge technological investment, backed by a brilliant marketing campaign, and championed by a beloved brand, than Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). If Apple succeeds in releasing its car, they are likely to not only reap enormous financial rewards, but also to massively swell the size of the electric vehicle market and, in so doing, create a permanent shift to a new era of automotive history.And, now we know -- people want an Apple Car -- and they want it more than anything else the company can deliver.The author is long shares of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) at the time of this writing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

YouTube surpassed the figure, which is far larger than previously reported, late last year. It represents a 10-fold increase since 2012, YouTube said, when it started building algorithms that tap user data to give each user personalized video lineups designed to keep them watching longer. Feeding those recommendations is an unmatched collection of content: 400 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube each minute, or 65 years of video a day.

A few years back, we made a big decision at YouTube. While everyone seemed focused on how many views a video got, we thought the amount of time someone spent watching a video was a better way to understand whether a viewer really enjoyed it. It wasn’t an easy call, but we thought it would help us make YouTube a more engaging place for creators and fans. And last year, we hit a big milestone on that journey: people around the world are now watching a billion hours of YouTube’s incredible content every single day!

Google, the former name for Alphabet, bought YouTube in 2006 for $1.65 billion. For years, it was not a major contributor to Google revenue. Recently, that has changed. YouTube’s revenue last year was pegged at over $10 billion.

YouTube has experimented with several business models. Among those are paid premium video services, meant to compete primarily with Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL). However, YouTube has never been a major player in this business. Instead, Alphabet management has recently focused on video advertising, which tends to carry hefty premiums over traditional online advertising. Recently, Apple, Mr. Clean, Budweiser and International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM) have been large advertisers, based on data from the January YouTube Advertiser Leader Board.

After the Trump administration released new rules related to immigration and border enforcement, interest in the subject of immigration surged on Google, with searches from Yakima and the Tri-Cities ranking among the highest in the country.

Nationwide, searches involving the word “immigration” peaked Tuesday evening on Google after the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s release of two memos outlining how it would carry out two executive orders signed by President Trump last month.

Those orders — separate from the “travel ban” entangled in federal court — directed the “immediate construction of a physical wall” on the U.S.-Mexico border, and the hiring of 15,000 more federal employees to patrol the border and conduct deportations. They also called for denying federal funds to “sanctuary cities” such as Seattle, and spelled out new rules allowing federal agents to seek deportation of undocumented immigrants who have been convicted of a crime.

Searches from Yakima, Pasco, Kennewick and Richland ranked first in the nation over the past seven days, according to Google Trends. The region is the state’s agricultural hub and has a sizable Latino population.

The area remained high in the search rankings through Friday morning, fluctuating with the news of immigration raids in other states, including Mississippi.

The new Homeland Security rules have generated concern statewide, said Jorge Barón, executive director of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project in Seattle.

“We are seeing mostly fear,’’ Barón said. “For instance, in the Seattle office, around the same time period last year, we were averaging 600, 700 calls per day. We’re now experiencing, the last couple of days, 1,300 calls per day.”

The calls are coming “directly from impacted community members, and also other folks in the community who are concerned about people that they know or people they work with,’’ Barón said. “We’re hearing from schools, health-care providers — they’re all trying to figure out what they can do to protect clients and people they work with.”

Barón said some of the searches could be driven by local news, particularly if there was coverage of enforcement actions by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, and by an uncertain political climate east of the Cascades.

“There’s a heightened level of concern in Eastern Washington because they’re not hearing the same things that people in Western Washington are hearing from their political leaders,’’ he said.

Barón said he spoke with the top attorney in the project’s Granger office, and learned that immigrants there “feel the rest of the community is in favor of enforcement, unlike Seattle where you see protests and support.”

Seattle Mayor Ed Murray has been adamant about protecting undocumented immigrants in the community and preserving Seattle’s status as a “sanctuary city.”

In January, the mayor said he is preparing to lose “every penny” of the tens of millions of dollars the federal government sends the city each year.

“This city will not be bullied by this administration into abandoning our core values, and we believe we have the rule of law and the courts on our side,” the mayor said at the time.

2/24/2017,0.543573989,0.058986175,827.73,829,824.2,828.64,1392202,4.8,0.91,1,"A Google researcher has uncovered what may be the most worrying web leak of 2017 so far, possibly exposing passwords, private messages and other sensitive data from a vast number of sites, including major services like Uber, FitBit and OKCupid.

It's being dubbed CloudBleed by some, as the problem was caused by a vulnerability in code from a hugely popular web company, CloudFlare, and was not dissimilar to the infamous Heartbleed bug of 2015 (though possibly more severe in terms of the potential for data leakage). It's similar to Heartbleed in that CloudFlare, which hosts and serves content for a at least 2 million websites, was returning random chunks of memory from vulnerable servers when requests came in.

Making the issue even more severe was the fact that search engines were caching that leaked information. Another major concern was that CloudFlare typically hosts content from different sites on the same server, so a request to one vulnerable website could reveal information about a separate, unrelated CloudFlare site.

""For example, you could have visited a page on uber.com, and a chunk of memory from a previous request/response to okcupid.com would be returned,"" explained Pen Test Partners whitehat hacker Andrew Tierney. ""This sensitive data could have been returned to anyone. There was no need to carry out an active attack to obtain the data - my mum may have someone else's passwords stored in her browser cache just by visiting another CloudFlare fronted site.""

Famous Google bug hunter Tavis Ormandy uncovered the issue, describing it in a brief post, noting that he informed CloudFlare of the problem on February 17. In his own proof-of-concept attack he was able to have the server return encryption keys, passwords and even HTTPS requests of other users from major CloudFlare-hosted sites.

Cloudflare have been leaking customer HTTPS sessions for months. Uber, 1Password, FitBit, OKCupid, etc. https://t.co/wjwE4M3Pbk — Tavis Ormandy (@taviso) February 23, 2017

In a later post, he found the issue to be even more severe: ""I'm finding private messages from major dating sites, full messages from a well-known chat service, online password manager data, frames from adult video sites, hotel bookings. We're talking full HTTPS requests, client IP addresses, full responses, cookies, passwords, keys, data, everything.""

Ormandy wrote that CloudFlare sent him a draft post that ""severely downplays the risk to customers,"" though he didn't say what he thought about the final public notification that went out Thursday. In that post, CloudFlare wrote: ""The bug was serious because the leaked memory could contain private information and because it had been cached by search engines. We have also not discovered any evidence of malicious exploits of the bug or other reports of its existence.

""The greatest period of impact was from February 13 and February 18 with around 1 in every 3,300,000 HTTP requests through CloudFlare potentially resulting in memory leakage (that’s about 0.00003 per cent of requests)."" It admitted that the earliest date memory could have leaked was September 22 2016. CloudFlare also said one of its own private keys leaked, one for internal machine-to-machine encryption.

A large list of CloudFlare websites has been uploaded to GitHub, though it's not clear just which ones leaked any data (another list found a handful of affected domains). The user who posted the Github list still recommended users of all those sites change their passwords as a precaution. Security entrepreneur Ryan Lackey recommended the same, though noted it was unlikely the average web user's password was in danger of being stolen.

What's the bug?

The problem lay in the way CloudFlare parsed and modified web pages when a user hit the site. When certain data was sent to the server, it would fail to parse the information properly and cough up sections of memory, jumping over the ""buffer"" designed to keep secret info secure. That memory might have contained sensitive data, like passwords or private communications.

Ormandy found the issue by firing a load of junk data at CloudFlare servers, a process called ""fuzzing."" In some cases, he received responses that contained information from memory. He could then easily replicate the process to guarantee that sensitive information would be returned.

CloudFlare, Google and other search engine providers have been scouring the web looking for sites that may have leaked information via the CloudBleed bug. They found 161 unique domains where leaked memory had been cached by the search engines, and that data has now been purged. ""We also undertook other search expeditions looking for potentially leaked information on sites like Pastebin and did not find anything,"" CloudFlare added.

Regardless of that cleanup and the continuing efforts of CloudFlare to remove the bug from its customers' servers, Google security researchers like Natalie Silvanovich believe the ultimate impact might be severe.

tl;dr there's no guarantee that private message you sent on OkCupid isn't on the public internet somewhere https://t.co/eZrb85l9ub — Natalie Silvanovich (@natashenka) February 23, 2017

UPDATE Uber says that the impact on its service was very limited. Only a handful of user session tokens were leaked, which could have allowed access to those particular accounts, and they've now been changed. Passwords were not exposed.

An OKCupid spokesperson said much the same: ""CloudFlare alerted us last night of their bug and we've been looking into its impact on OkCupid members. Our initial investigation has revealed minimal, if any, exposure. If we determine that any of our users has been impacted we will promptly notify them and take action to protect them.""

FitBit said it was investigating, adding that concerned users can change their account password whenever they wanted. It's encouraging anyone who believes they had an issue to send an email to security@fitbit.com.

Keep in mind, however, that companies may not be able to determine how, when or how many times data was leaked into people's browser caches, or if any attacks took place. CloudFlare could provide some idea of the total impact, though.

CloudFlare CEO Matthew Prince told FORBES that the company had logs for requests that triggered the bug. He said that during the five-day period between February 13 and February 18, every day there were approximately 100,000 requests for the affected 3,500 pages. That meant roughly 500,000 connections could have caused data to leak. For each customer, only ""relatively small amounts of data"" were leaked. That information was passed onto customers so they could determine the impact.

He explained that the higher traffic customers were more at risk of leaking information. Because customers of CloudFlare share servers, when the vulnerability was triggered it would leak whatever random memory was passing through the system at that time. That would more often be for sites that get more visitors.

As Prince noted, this problem could have been far worse if Google hadn't issued an alert. ""I think we dodged a bullet there,"" he added. ""[Malicious hackers] could have made hundreds of millions of requests to those pages and pulled a lot of data.""

The search giant said Friday on a technical support page that it would shut down its Spaces app on Apr.17. Google debuted the app in May and pitched it as an easy way for people to conduct multiple online conversations based on individual topics like sports and news.

The app was tethered to several other Google ( goog ) products like search and YouTube, and was intended to encourage people to chat and share articles and videos with each other inside the app.

Apparently, Spaces never caught on, and it joins several other messaging and social networking apps that Google has revamped or shuttered over the years because of a lack of popularity, including Google+ and Wave.

In a few weeks, the Snapchat IPO will hit the markets, and it seems like a pretty good bet that there will be quite a bit of interest in the deal. But unless you are a mega-wealthy investor or manage a financial institution, you'll likely not get any shares in the offering. Rather, you'll have to buy SNAP in the after-market, when the valuation will probably be much higher.

So is it any wonder that IPOs can be a raw deal?

That may be true, but when it comes to investing in the big-growth opportunities, there really is no need to speculate in the IPO market. Hey, there are a variety of interesting stocks currently on the market that should be good enough.

Take a Look at GOOGL Stock

One to consider is actually Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ). Granted, the company is fairly mature, having been founded in 1998.

But what's important about GOOGL stock is that the company has global brand, scale, infrastructure and massive user base to play in critical growth markets. Such factors are must-haves for getting the attention of sponsors, especially those that have massive budgets.

This is why a company like Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR ) has struggled so much. In fact, in the latest quarter, the company's revenues increased by a mere 0.9% on a year-over-year basis to $717.2 million, marking the 10th consecutive quarter of top-line deceleration. U.S. revenues fell by 4% to $440 million and of course, the company has yet to generate a profit on a GAAP basis.

All this happened even though there were major catalysts from the presidential election, NFL streaming and the holiday season.

By comparison, in the latest quarter Alphabet reported an impressive 22% jump in revenues to $26.1 billion and GAAP earnings of $5.33 billion, or $7.56 per share on GOOGL stock.

But this shouldn't be much of a surprise. The fact is that GOOGL is positioned nicely for major growth categories like video (YouTube), mobile (Android, Google Play and Waze), devices (Pixel and Google Home) and cloud computing. All these represent multi-billion-dollar market opportunities - and should all provide nice long-term drivers for GOOGL stock.

Just look at Waze, which Alphabet Inc purchased for $1.3 billion back in October 2013. Interestingly enough, this price tag may have been a bargain! Note that GOOGL plans to launch a ride- hailing service - similar to Uber's - in various cities in the U.S. that is based on the Waze platform.

By the way, back in 2013, the company also invested $258 million in Uber.

Although, when it comes to GOOGL stock, the real play is likely to be the impact from the company's major investments in deep learning and AI (artificial intelligence). Let's face it, Alphabet has a big-time advantage because of its experience in handling massive amounts of information with search.

Already GOOGL is introducing great AI products, such as its Assistant offering (the app allows for sophisticated natural language conversations). But the company has also included more than 350 AI features across many of the company's other products during 2016.

According to Alphabet Inc CEO Sundar Pichai : ""As I've shared before, computing is moving from a mobile-first to AI-first with more universal ambient and intelligent computing that you can interact with naturally, all made smarter by the progress we are making with machine learning.""

More importantly, GOOGL stock is currently trading at an attractive valuation. Consider that the forward price-to-earnings ratio is roughly 22X. Although, if you strip out the $86 billion in the bank, the multiple is 19. And this is roughly in line with Wall Street's 19% five-year forecasted growth rate.

OK, then what about Snap? True, growth is ramping at a rapid pace. But then again, the company has only recently begun to monetize its user base, so it does not take much to generate huge spikes.

Yet it appears that - based on estimates from Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS ) - Snap will churn out roughly $2 billion in revenues in 2018 . But this will still mean that the company will trade at over 10 times revenues on a two-year forward basis . As for GOOGL stock, it is currently at a price-to-sales multiple of 6.4X.

So again, if you don't get shares of Snap (and you probably won't - at least the at the offering price), then it's no big deal. Buying GOOGL stock should be just fine.

Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOG , GOOGL ) Waymo is suing Uber for using technology that it claims was stolen from it by a former employee.

Waymo, the self-driving car company that belongs to GOOGL, claims that one of Uber's employees stole technology from it and used it for the company's own self-driving car efforts. The company says this employee is Anthony Levandowski.

Anthony Levandowski is the founder of Otto. Otto is a self-driving car startup that was created in 2016. Uber bought this startup in 2016 and added Levandowski to its team. Levandowski was a previous employee of the GOOGL car company before founding Otto.

According to Waymo, Anthony Levandowski downloaded more than 14,000 confidential and proprietary design files for its hardware systems six weeks before resigning from the GOOGL company. Among those files were the company's design data for its LiDAR system.

Waymo says that it has decided to file a lawsuit against Uber after receiving an email from one of its suppliers. The supplier makes parts for the GOOGL company's LiDAR system. In the email was a picture of a circuit board for Uber's own LiDAR technology. Waymo says this circuit board looked incredibly like the one it created for its own LiDAR system.

Waymo says that after conducting some research, it has discovered that other former employees also downloaded confidential information from the company. These employees now work for Uber and Otto. The GOOGL company claims this was an organized act to steal its trade secrets and intellectual property.

Waymo also claims that Anthony Levandowski expressed his desire to ""replicate"" the company's technology as a rival. It claims he told employees of this plan months before his retirement.

This podcast was recorded on Feb. 16, 2017.

Dylan Lewis: Welcome to Industry Focus , the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. It's Friday, Feb. 17, and we're talking tech and exploring Snap's IPO filing. I'm your host, Dylan Lewis, and I'm joined on Skype by fool.com senior tech specialist Evan Niu. Evan, how's it going?

Evan Niu: Pretty good, pretty good.

Lewis: Are you a Snapchat user? Do you have it on your phone?

Niu: I recently downloaded it just to play around with it. I've read plenty about it, I know how it works, I know the gist of it. But I started playing around with it, and it's really not intuitive or easy to use. [laughs] I don't have a lot of people on there that I follow, so I certainly don't have the full experience of regular users. But I don't really see the appeal to it. It seems really niche to me.

Lewis: Yeah, I'll say, I am a Snapchat user. I have a lot of friends that use it. My interest will wane depending on how often my friends are using it, and that will bring me in or out of the system. But, it seems to be super popular with millennials, and given a lot of the buzz with the company and the fact that it is a big tech company that's thinking about going public, there are a lot of investors that are interested in it.

Niu: Yeah, there's been so much hype around this thing. It doesn't seem to me like it has a mainstream appeal, which is the exact problem that Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) has run into over the past few years. I see a lot more closer comparisons to Twitter than Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) , which is the exact opposite storyline that Snap is going to try to sell doing its roadshow.

Lewis: Yeah. Listeners, to give you an idea of what we're going to talk about today, give you a little overview of Snap, the Snapchat property specifically, talk a bit about their plans to go public, and what Evan and I noticed when we dug through the S-1 that recently became available. So, we talked about, they are social media company, but they call themselves a camera company, which is interesting.

Niu: I noticed this really funny coincidence -- I don't know if you would call it a coincidence -- Snapchat used to consider itself a storytelling company, and now it's calling itself a camera company. Meanwhile, GoPro used to call itself a camera company and now is trying to call itself a storytelling company. So, these two companies, they have this weird identity thing where they want to be each other, and I don't get why, because it's not like GoPro is doing very well. I think it's kind of a weird thing rebrand themselves as a camera company. I mean, they have the new Spectacle glasses with cameras, but I don't know. It's just a weird identity to me.

Lewis: Yeah. For listeners who might not be familiar with the social media platform Snapchat, basically, you can think of it as a messaging platform where you are, for the most part, shooting quick, instantly deleted pictures and videos to you and your friends. You can also post them as stories. It has gained a lot of popularity with the millennial group. User count is still kind of low, we can talk about that a little bit, but the company is planning to go public, looking to raise $3 billion via the public markets in an issuance that would value the whole company a somewhere between $20 [billion] to $25 billion. As tech IPOs go, this might be one of the biggest ones for 2017.

Niu: Yeah, definitely. It's definitely the most exciting, the most looked forward to. People have been waiting for this thing for years.

Lewis: Yeah, and anything that's consumer-facing is naturally going to have a lot more buzz to it. I think there might be some folks out there who are saying, ""Wait a minute, I thought I saw an announcement that this company planned to IPO back in the fall of 2016. Why are we just getting the S-1 and all the information about the company in the past couple weeks?"" That's because Snap opted to go public via the confidential IPO process. This process and this approach is a byproduct of the 2012 Jumpstart Our Businesses Act. Basically, under this updated legislation, companies with under $1 billion in annual revenue can file paperwork for an IPO confidentially with the SEC. That allows the company to go back and forth with the regulatory agency without alerting the public that they are planning on IPO-ing, although Snap chose to do so anyway. Then, once the company decides they do want to go forward with an issuance, the filing must be made public at least three weeks prior to the IPO roadshow beginning, which is when the underwriting investment banks begin talking to clients and building interest in a potential issuance. This is all to say, while the ""confidential IPO"" name might sound kind of shady, this is something that's totally on the up-and-up. And that is the reason why we only got a look at the company's books and the S-1 earlier this month, even though they announced intentions to IPO a ways back.

Niu: Right. I think part of the purpose is to, like you mentioned, avoid public scrutiny for the early drafts of the S-1. All companies always have to file the S-1, but this way they can refine it without all the public scrutiny, looking at it and scrutinizing it. I think the idea is to encourage more companies to explore the IPO process, and if companies do end up going public, they get more capital, and it just boosts the economy in terms of more investments happening. I think that's the goal. But, yeah, it is a little weird when you hear ""confidential.""

Lewis: Yeah, and I think it also gives companies the opportunity to maybe think about going public and walk back without sharing all of their business information publicly. So, you can test the waters and see if you're ready, and you might decide you're not, but you don't have to go through the question of your business practices, if you think you're going to file and you have to publicly walk back.

Niu: Right, exactly.

Lewis: So, that's part of it. There are some adjustments in the regulatory requirements for how far back a company needs to provide financial statements, as well. But really, all in all, it's a tool that allows small-growing companies to keep some of their core business info private and make the going-public process a little bit easier. And that's really all there is to the confidential IPO process. Given that the company's S-1 filing became public earlier this month, I think it's fairly safe to assume we're going to see Snap trading on the New York Stock Exchange sometime in the next couple months. Evan?

Niu: Yeah, seems like it's coming.

Lewis: Considering that they are a social media company, I think it makes the most sense to start looking at their user base and what's going on there. That's kind of the lifeblood of businesses like Facebook and Twitter, and Snap is really no different. Within their S-1, they mention, ""We assess the health of our business by measuring daily active users because we believe that this metric is the most reliable way to understand engagement on our platform."" So, it's clear that this is what they're honing it on as a key metric, and it's what investors are going to be watching as well.

Niu: Yeah. I did find it interesting that they don't disclose monthly active users, they only disclose daily active users, which is right around 160 million. With social media companies, I always tend to look at sequential growth as opposed to year-over-year growth, because with user base, that's the nature, there's no seasonality, it's just how much you can grow over time. So, I look at sequential. In that respect, Snap's growth is really decelerating -- it's grinding to a halt, almost. And the company tries to explain this in saying, ""Oh, it's because we haven't come out with any big new product innovation."" And, of course, that has an impact, but you also have to worry about competition, because Facebook has done a really good job copying a lot of Snapchat's features, especially the Story thing, which is now on Instagram. Facebook already has, I think, about 150 million daily active users using Stories now. And they launched that last year, and it's an exact replica. So, you have to wonder if that's what's taking a bite out of it. And, obviously, Facebook is much bigger, they have more resources, they can innovate and develop faster. It's really Mark Zuckerberg, and Silicon Valley's -- I mean, Snapchat isn't based in Silicon Valley, but Facebook certainly is -- and Facebook tried to buy them, and if they can't buy them, they'll copy them, and they compete, and that's exactly what they're doing. And they're doing a really good job so far. So, I think there is some concern about competition and whether or not Snap can really keep up.

Lewis: Yeah. And Facebook famously made Snapchat an offer, I believe it was somewhere around $5 billion or so, a little ways back, and CEO Evan Spiegel said, ""No, we're going to see what we can do with this on our own."" If they wind up going public at this gaudy valuation, it certainly works out well for him, but you wonder if that might have stoked the competitive fire in Mark Zuckerberg a little bit.

Niu: And he can also empathize, because he did the exact same thing with Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) . [laughs] So many people tried to buy Facebook, and he said, ""No, I want to do my own thing,"" and now Facebook is enormous and he is one of the richest men in the world. [laughs]

Lewis: Yeah it's hard to blame him for that. To put some numbers on what's going on with their user growth, like you said, year-over-year, the numbers look really great. They're up 48%. But sequentially, Q3 to Q4 of 2016, growth was only 3%. So, if you look at the graph that they provided in their S-1, it does look like growth is flattening out a little bit. Given that so much of the expectation for these social platforms is continuing to build user base, and being able to monetize that user base really well, you have to worry about that as an ongoing risk for the business.

Niu: Yeah. If they are a niche product, which, it seems that way to me, then this could be it...and, obviously, 160 million daily users is a pretty big number. And you can build a healthy business there if you keep your expectations modest and try to build around that base. Whereas, if you're trying to grow, if you're spending a ton of money trying to grow it, and you can't, which is exactly the problem that Twitter is having, then that's when it starts to hurt financially. But if you just accept it for what it is and plan your business accordingly, you can build a pretty decent business out of it.

Lewis: Yeah. For some context, I went back and looked at Facebook's S-1 to see how they stacked up when they went public. At the time, they had 480 million daily active users, and they were posting 48% year-over-year growth and 6% sequential growth. You hear that and think, ""Well, those growth rates are kind of similar, right?"" The difference was scale. Even when they were doing single-digit sequential growth quarter-to-quarter, they were still adding tens of millions of users, not five million, as Snapchat did last quarter. I think that's a huge risk, especially as you see a more entrenched competitor taking what's working for you and has a lot of traction with users that you already have on your platform and just applying it to this massive user base that they have.

Niu: Right. Facebook is interesting because they started earlier, before the really big rise of mobile. So a lot of their early days were on desktop. Then, they had to navigate the transition to mobile, which they have done ridiculously well, far better than I think anyone ever imagined, whereas companies like Twitter and Snap, they came out on mobile from the beginning. Particularly Snap -- I mean, there is no desktop Snapchat.

Lewis: Right. Beyond the user base, I think a lot of people want to know what's going on with the financials as well. In 2016, the company booked $404 million in revenue, up from $58 million in revenue in 2015. That is humongous growth, but that is on a very tiny denominator. The reality with Snapchat is that they really just kind of turned on the monetization engine there, and have only really rolled out ads for a very short period of time. Right now, even, it's still a pretty ad-light experience for users.

Niu: Yeah. They only recently released their API to automate ad sales, which is a hugely important part of scaling for advertising businesses, because it allows your advertisers to do this automatically, it's much less labor-intensive to do it. So, they literally only did this a few months ago, and it's still in beta. So, it's very early days in terms of their ad business.

Lewis: And that's really what's going to be making up most of the money for Snap overall, right? Advertising made up 96% of Snap's revenue in 2016. I don't expect that to change. We talked about how they have the Spectacles as well, and they bill themselves as a camera company. There might be some hardware applications somewhere down the road, but in terms of a scalable, high-margin business, they're going to look to monetize the Snapchat platform first, because if they can do it well, the opportunity is the biggest there.

Niu: Oh, absolutely. You can't make money on hardware. Those glasses...you might make a little bit of money, but the whole point of that is to get people to use the platform.

Lewis: Exactly, yeah. And that just feeds into the idea of people posting their stories and sending stuff to friends, and making that video and picture capture a little bit easier. Looking down at their bottom line, they ran a $500 million loss in 2016, down even more from losses of $370 million in 2015. The company is also free cash flow negative to the tune of $670 million. No surprise there. It's a high-growth tech company, very rarely are they profitable when they go public. But one thing, I don't want to nitpick too much with costs, but one line item that popped out to me was general and administrative expenses are $165 million, which is more than they spent in sales and marketing, and almost as much as the company spent in R&D. And they talk about how this is attributable to headcount increasing 200% year over year, but from a corporate strategy perspective, it seems like there's sinking a ton of money into G&A. I would think, if anything, the big money suck would be on the tech side, and gaining talent and pushing the platform in a new direction.

Niu: Particularly with them talking about how important product innovation is to driving user growth, you would think they would invest more in that. But yeah, overall, I'm not too surprised at their costs in terms of their operating expenses. I just don't know what they're going to do next to try to really grow the platform more. Why aren't they spending more money on R&D?

Lewis: Yeah. And they're going to have to. If you look at the current valuation...we talked about how they're probably going to end up IPOing somewhere in the $20 [billion] to $25 billion valuation range. That would mean that they are trading at 62X trailing sales. Not earnings, sales. That is a huge number.

Niu: Yeah, it's ridiculous. I remember when Twitter and Facebook went public a few years back. They both went probably right around 25-26X sales. And back then, I was like, ""Wow, that's really expensive."" [laughs] And now, 62X sales, it's unheard of. It just speaks to the hype around this company. Of course, the valuation is going to change, and we don't know what they're actually going to price the IPO at. Right now, everything is really preliminary, and they don't price the IPO until the night before it actually goes public. And, of course, that's all a function of how successful the roadshow is. If they can really drum up investor interest, or conversely, if they don't, then that's going to really drive what the IPO price is at. But there's a possibility that this goes higher if they have a really good roadshow, which is insane. Can you imagine them getting closer to 70X sales? Who knows at this point -- it's not impossible for that to happen. It's just insane that this company would be able to command such a premium.

Lewis: And I think another layer of context here: Were it to IPO and have a valuation somewhere in the mid 20s, it would basically be valued at twice Twitter's current valuation. According to analysts, Snapchat has more daily active users than Twitter, but Twitter brought in 5X as much revenue last year. So, when you think about what a really successful ad launch would look like, and building out the platform in a way that has non-invasive ads that don't really detract too much from user experience, and you start to get into that $2.5 billion annual ad revenue, and building on that. And they would be doing that at twice the valuation that Twitter is currently at. So, you just look at the numbers, and it's really tough to make it work, the way it's currently priced.

Niu: Yeah. There's no way I'm touching this thing. [laughs]

Lewis: Beyond valuation and some of the user growth issues, I know that you particularly wanted to hone in on some of the stuff with voting rights with the shares they'll actually be issuing.

Niu: Yeah, I think it's really interesting. The shares that they're issuing to the public get zero votes. Not even one, zero. A lot of tech companies have been doing this thing for a long time where they give the public shares one vote, and the insiders get these supervoting shares with 10 votes or more. That allows the company founders and insiders to maintain control no matter what. Google is probably the biggest and earliest example of this. Even today, collectively, all the insiders, between the executives and directors of Google, they collectively control about 60% of the voting power. So, public investors really have no say. If they disagree with something, they have no recourse. Facebook is, of course, another good example, with Zuckerberg himself personally controlling about 60% of the voting power. So, he wouldn't even have to ask anyone, he just does whatever he wants. So, the question is, is it really a big deal? Investors are now used to this idea that they don't get a say and how these companies are run. The difference with Snap is that they're basically being upfront and being like, ""You don't even get to pretend like you have a say.""

Certainly, it's all bad from a corporate governance perspective on principle, because obviously, it's better for shareholders to have a say. But at the same time, you can see that it's worked quite well for companies like Google and Facebook. Imagine if Google shareholders had a vote in telling Google not to do all this random side stuff that they explore, you could argue that the company wouldn't be as successful as it has. There is a case to be made that this is a good thing, in some situations. But we don't know how it's going to play out for Snap.

Lewis: Yeah. I think one of the reasons why I have a bone to pick with it is, you have the two company co-founders, Evan Spiegel, the CEO, and Robert Murphy, the CTO. They are the sole owners of the supervoting Class C shares, which get 10 votes. Any Class Bs or Cs that are sold are transferred automatically convert to the Class As, the non-voting shares. Anything that would happen with them, they have a supermajority, and anything that might happen would continue to concentrate that power. So, you look at these tech companies later on issuing non-voting shares, or with Facebook, deciding that they want to split its stock and issue C shares so that Mark Zuckerberg can retain his control of the company and be able to give away the non-voting shares through his charitable efforts. Mark Zuckerberg has demonstrated that he has the right combination of that tech-forward thinking and the business savvy in order to run one of the world's biggest companies and do it incredibly successfully. Spiegel and Murphy don't have that track record.

Niu: Right. Zuckerberg has definitely earned some respect. He's really demonstrated that he can execute on these bigger-picture strategies and growing Facebook in the way that he has. The stock split thing is funny because, like you were saying, he voted it in personally, single-handedly. It doesn't matter if you didn't like the stock split, which hasn't actually occurred yet even though it's been approved, because he said it would happen. But, yeah, you really need to trust these founders. And Spiegel is 26 or 27. Of course, Zuckerberg was too, a few years back. But, to your point, he just doesn't have a track record. And it's like, what has he done beyond creating Snapchat? You can't really point to any single great business move and be like, ""That was a really smart strategy, that was a really good move."" You know? You have to have a lot of faith.

Lewis: One of the other things I'm seeing a lot of people talk about, digging through the S-1 and doing their homework on the company, is the company's cloud strategy.

Niu: Yeah, this is really an interesting topic for me because Snapchat is doing something that's really unprecedented in terms of how they're approaching their cloud infrastructure. Most of the time, when companies are launching these apps and online services and consumer-based products, eventually, when they get to a certain point, they start investing in their own infrastructure, either by building their own data centers and servers in co-located facilities that they share with other companies, or building their own. Facebook is building its seventh data center, and it's fully owned. Twitter co-locates its data centers. Snap is not doing any of that. Snap is relying 100% on third-party cloud infrastructure providers, Google Cloud and Amazon AWS. It's just crazy because the scale at which they're operating, it would normally make sense to start investing in it yourself, but Snap is content to basically continue to do this through third parties. It's not clear if this is going to work, because no one has ever tried this before, so it's this huge experiment, and there are a lot of risks because you don't get to control your infrastructure in your back end, which is incredibly important to your business, and you're also spending a ton of money. Obviously, building the infrastructure yourself costs a ridiculous amount of money. But over time, it will eventually pay for itself.

So, what Snap is doing is that they committed to spending $3 billion total over the next five years between Google and Amazon combined. Google is the primary provider, and Amazon is basically a backup. They're spending $400 million a year on Google. The spending commitment with Amazon ramps up, it starts at like $50 million and then it's $350 million by the end. But that's a huge spending commitment. This is, very specifically, their largest cost. If you look at their financials, the cost revenue is predominantly composed of these infrastructure costs, and cost revenue is greater than revenue. So, they have a negative gross margin right now because of this strategy very specifically. At the same time, because of these long-term commitments, the pressure is now on for the ad business. You have to grow ad sales to these levels just to keep up with it, just to break even on gross profit, before you even start talking about operating expenses.

The pressure to grow the ad business is incredibly high, and they have almost no experience doing that. So, it's a huge risk not only operationally, but it's also a huge risk financially. If you are unable to grow your ad business enough to cover these costs, you're just going to be hemorrhaging cash. And it doesn't matter how popular the service is, if you're just blowing through money and you can't bring in enough to cover these costs, it's not sustainable. We don't know if they'll be able to do it or not, but the point is, the risk that's there is insane. They have to really turn up these ad sales just to cover their spending commitments.

Lewis: Yeah, beyond all of the general investor interest in Snap that will undoubtedly be there for the next couple years and beyond, I think there will be a lot of tech insiders watching this decision. If it works, maybe they'll use it as a blueprint, and decide that it allows the company to be more nimble. But, you have to wonder about the company's ability to control costs, and have total control over what's going on with the IT infrastructure, because that's how everyone is interacting with their product.

Niu: Yeah. Everyone in the cloud infrastructure market is watching very closely, because they're like, ""This is crazy, how much this company is spending."" It's great news for the cloud infrastructure market, of course, because it's one of the biggest customers out there. They're bringing in a lot of money, and everyone is going to see if this can really work. I mean, it's worth noting that Snap is hedging itself saying it might eventually -- in the S-1, it says they may choose to invest in its infrastructure at some point. A few months ago, they actually poached Amazon's head of data centers for AWS. So, it's like, there are some hints that they're exploring the idea of doing their own infrastructure. But, at the same time, it probably wouldn't be for the next five years because of these commitments. So, yeah, they're still leaving themselves an out. But it seems really risky. It might work out great. In the event that things go down -- let's say the service just crashes -- that does let them ramp down variable costs with more flexibility, as opposed to, if you spend all this money to build all this infrastructure and the service dies for whatever reason, theoretically, then you would be stuck with all this infrastructure you paid all this money for. Versus, just paying it as a variable expense based on usage. So, it's going to be something that's going to be very interesting to see play out, not just because of Snap, but also because of the implications for the bigger companies that are providing these services like Amazon and Google, also Microsoft . Microsoft would certainly like to get a piece of that spending. But yeah, I think that has a lot of implications for the broader infrastructure market.

Lewis: To bring it back around to the stock itself and how we're looking at it, it seems like you and I are in the same camp here -- we have some concerns over user growth, the valuation as it's currently being reported, we'll see what happens after they run through the roadshow, but the valuation is a little too rich for us to really even look at too much, also we have a lot of questions about the competitive risks with some Facebook and Instagram looming out there, and possibly being able to just grab features and drop it on their installed base. Does that wrap how we feel about Snap? Anything else you want to add in there, Evan?

Niu: I don't think Snap's investable, honestly. There are so many risks, the financials don't make sense, the valuation doesn't make sense, you get no voting. [laughs] I don't doubt that shares will pop from the offering just because of the hype, but as we've seen with many overhyped IPOs in recent years, it only takes a few months for the market to sober up. Plus, Snap's also doing a different thing with the lock-up period. Employees will be able to sell sooner -- the lock-up expires for employees sooner than is typical. Normally, it's about 180 days. They're going to allow their employees to sell at 150 days, along with all the co-founders. So, there could be some selling pressure as all these investors and employees cash out. The employees and all the insiders are going to make a ton of money, but as far as public investors go, I don't know. It's also worth mentioning that their stock-based compensation expenses so far are quite small because they're still private. I think last year it was something like $30-some million, which is a tiny proportion of their expenses. But when companies go public, the liquidity event triggers a ridiculous increase in stock-based compensation cost because now that stock is worth so much more. And that's typical for all companies that go public -- right after they go public, they have a huge increase in stock-based comp. That's something to be aware that is coming. Plus, they're probably going to start unloading pretty quickly. I don't know, I just don't see, after the initial honeymoon, how this thing can really go even further, after it's already at such a ridiculous level. You know what I mean?

Lewis: I am absolutely with you. Listeners, you can be sure that as details start to crystallize and we get a better sense of what's happening with the Snap IPO, we'll be sure to do an update on this episode as market conditions clear up a little bit. But, for now, I think that does it. Evan?

However, excluding the impact of the Qunar division which Baidu sold off last year, the company observed roughly flat revenues over the year-ago period. Baidu's total operating costs were up 6% to RMB 16 billion, with content acquisition costs (for iQiyi online video), traffic acquisition costs and bandwidth acquisition costs driving much of the growth. As a result, Baidu's operating profit (GAAP) for the quarter was down 38% y-o-y to RMB 2.2 billion. Moreover, the company's net income was significantly lower than the prior year period and earnings per ADS was 84% down to RMB 11.40 per ADS for the quarter.

Smaller Segments Drive Revenue Growth, Compress Margins

Baidu has witnessed strong growth in two of its smaller revenue streams over the the last 2-3 years - its online video streaming platform iQiyi, which is similar to Netflix ( NFLX ), and transaction services. Both segments witnessed over 70% revenue growth in 2015, which was slightly lower than the triple digit growth seen in the previous year. The company reported 23% growth in the gross merchandise value (GMV) for its transaction services segment to RMB 18.1 billion in the December quarter. Similarly, the total number of Baidu Wallet user accounts was up to 100 million users by the end of December, up from only about 53 million in the year-ago period. Furthermore, the total number of monthly active users (MAUs) for mobile maps rose to 341 million users, 23% higher than the previous year levels.

Similarly, Baidu's iQiyi online video streaming has also grown at a rapid pace over the last couple of years. However, the company has operated its streaming video business as well as the transaction business at a loss over the past few years. In December 2015, there were reports suggesting that the company could spin off the iQiyi division. Earlier last year, a consortium of investors led by Baidu CEO Robin Li wanted to buy out the iQiyi business for $2.3 billion, but later dropped the bid after investors claimed that the price was too low. More recently, Baidu announced that it has raised funding for the video streaming business, which should help it acquire more content and help the company focus on long-term growth.

To fuel growth in the smaller revenue streams, Baidu has invested heavily in content acquisition costs, bandwidth costs for the video business and traffic acquisition costs for the transaction business, in addition to high marketing expenses for both. This has led to operating losses for both divisions over the last few years - a trend which was also observed in the most recent quarter. Baidu reported that the operating profit margin (non-GAAP) for the transaction services business in Q4 was down around 22 percentage points on a y-o-y basis while the operating profit margin for iQiyi compressed by over 9 percentage points through the quarter. These divisions are likely to be operating at a loss over next couple of years as well. As a result, we forecast the operating profits for both these divisions to be be negative over the next few years.

Growth In The First Half Of The Year Drives Full Year Results



Over the last two quarters, Baidu's revenue growth for its core search services segment has been hindered by a revision in regulatory policy that drove down marketing revenues through the quarter. According to the latest Chinese laws, online ads and marketingpractices for medical, pharmaceutical, and healthcare products and services on online platforms have to go through mandatory regulatory approvals.

Net revenues for the full year were around 6% higher on a y-o-y basis to RMB 70.5 billion. Comparatively, higher operating expenses - primarily for content acquisition, bandwidth acquisition and marketing expenses led operating profit to fall by 14% to just over RMB 10 billion. As a result, the company-wide operating profit margin compressed by 360 basis points to 14%. The resulting earnings per ADS was down 67% to just under RMB 32 per ADS, as shown above.

IMAX reported revenue of $106.9 million for the quarter, down 10% from $119.3 million from the prior year quarter, though it was better than the $99.6 million analysts were expecting. Net income of $0.27 per diluted share also exceeded expectations of $0.21 expected by analysts. Pulling back to a wider view, the overall annual results looked better. For the full year, IMAX produced revenue of $377 million compared to $374 million in the prior year.

Let's face it: While 2016 was a good year at the movies, this was never going to be easy. The slate from 2015 boasted such cinematic heavyweights as Jurassic World , Furious 7 , Avengers: Age of Ultron , Minions , and Star Wars: The Force Awakens . These top five movies pulled in a combined $7.8 billion in box office. Even though 2016 leaders Captain America: Civil War , Rogue One: A Star Wars Story , Finding Dory and Zootopia , and The Jungle Book were each an unqualified success, their combined box office of $5.2 billion was nearly $2.6 billion below the results of 2015's all-stars. That's a lot of popcorn.

Expanding network and deals

There was, however, plenty of good news in the report for investors willing to dig a little deeper. The company installed 166 new IMAX theaters during the year, up 22% over the prior year. This brings the installed base of theaters to 1,215 screens in 75 countries. The company also signed installation agreements for a record 319 IMAX theater systems during the year and the backlog of theaters waiting to be built now totals 498. The majority of these new signings were joint-revenue sharing agreements, which cost more up front, but allows IMAX to share in future box office revenue going forward. This all indicates that the company is well positioned to take advantage of an improved slate of movies in 2017 and beyond.

IMAX also announced that it had extended its existing agreement with The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) with a multi-picture deal through 2019. From the press release:

Highlights of the agreement include IMAX's involvement in the release of Lucasfilm's untitled Indiana Jones film, untitled Han Solo Star Wars anthology film, Star Wars: The Last Jedi and Star Wars: Episode IX, Marvel's Black Panther , Ant-Man and the Wasp , Captain Marvel , Avengers: Infinity War and the untitled Avengers sequel; Disney's Beauty and the Beast , A Wrinkle in Time and Mulan ; Pixar's The Incredibles 2 and Toy Story 4 and Walt Disney Animation Studios' Wreck-It Ralph sequel.

JUMPing on this opportunities

Another exciting development for the company is in the field of virtual reality (VR). IMAX announced last year that it had partnered with Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Google to develop a cinema grade VR camera, incorporating Google's Jump 360 camera rig. This fits into IMAX's strategy for a location-based virtual reality initiative, which would allow friends to participate in a group VR experience. On the conference call, IMAX indicated that more than 7,000 attendees had visited the pilot center, which opened in Los Angeles on January 6th, during its first six weeks of operation. The company believes that providing consumers with an option to participate in VR without spending thousands of dollars on equipment will ""kick-start"" the industry. As the result of this successful pilot, IMAX is expanding its experiment to five additional locations, which it expects will all be open by mid-year.

Though 2016 didn't give IMAX investors anything to cheer about, the company has been investing in the future. IMAX has been quietly investing in big initiatives, signing new theaters and building out its network. Seems like its following advice from an old movie ""if you build it, they will come"".

So is it any wonder that IPOs can be a raw deal?

That may be true, but when it comes to investing in the big-growth opportunities, there really is no need to speculate in the IPO market. Hey, there are a variety of interesting stocks currently on the market that should be good enough.

Take a Look at GOOGL Stock

One to consider is actually Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ). Granted, the company is fairly mature, having been founded in 1998.

But what’s important about GOOGL stock is that the company has global brand, scale, infrastructure and massive user base to play in critical growth markets. Such factors are must-haves for getting the attention of sponsors, especially those that have massive budgets.

This is why a company like Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR ) has struggled so much. In fact, in the latest quarter, the company’s revenues increased by a mere 0.9% on a year-over-year basis to $717.2 million, marking the 10th consecutive quarter of top-line deceleration. U.S. revenues fell by 4% to $440 million and of course, the company has yet to generate a profit on a GAAP basis.

All this happened even though there were major catalysts from the presidential election, NFL streaming and the holiday season.

By comparison, in the latest quarter Alphabet reported an impressive 22% jump in revenues to $26.1 billion and GAAP earnings of $5.33 billion, or $7.56 per share on GOOGL stock.

But this shouldn’t be much of a surprise. The fact is that GOOGL is positioned nicely for major growth categories like video (YouTube), mobile (Android, Google Play and Waze), devices (Pixel and Google Home) and cloud computing. All these represent multi-billion-dollar market opportunities — and should all provide nice long-term drivers for GOOGL stock.

Just look at Waze, which Alphabet Inc purchased for $1.3 billion back in October 2013. Interestingly enough, this price tag may have been a bargain! Note that GOOGL plans to launch a ride-hailing service — similar to Uber’s — in various cities in the U.S. that is based on the Waze platform.

By the way, back in 2013, the company also invested $258 million in Uber.

Waymo, the self-driving car company that belongs to GOOGL, claims that one of Uber’s employees stole technology from it and used it for the company’s own self-driving car efforts. The company says this employee is Anthony Levandowski.

Anthony Levandowski is the founder of Otto. Otto is a self-driving car startup that was created in 2016. Uber bought this startup in 2016 and added Levandowski to its team. Levandowski was a previous employee of the GOOGL car company before founding Otto.

According to Waymo, Anthony Levandowski downloaded more than 14,000 confidential and proprietary design files for its hardware systems six weeks before resigning from the GOOGL company. Among those files were the company’s design data for its LiDAR system.

Waymo says that it has decided to file a lawsuit against Uber after receiving an email from one of its suppliers. The supplier makes parts for the GOOGL company’s LiDAR system. In the email was a picture of a circuit board for Uber’s own LiDAR technology. Waymo says this circuit board looked incredibly like the one it created for its own LiDAR system.

Waymo says that after conducting some research, it has discovered that other former employees also downloaded confidential information from the company. These employees now work for Uber and Otto. The GOOGL company claims this was an organized act to steal its trade secrets and intellectual property.

Waymo also claims that Anthony Levandowski expressed his desire to “replicate” the company’s technology as a rival. It claims he told employees of this plan months before his retirement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These included supplier lists, manufacturing details and technical information, Waymo said.

The suit accuses Uber of stealing trade secrets, infringing on patents and competing unfairly in an effort to catch up on autonomous vehicle technology.

Otto was the brainchild of a handful of former Google employees who pioneered autonomous vehicle research at the search giant. Mr. Levandowski, who had been at Google nine years, led that effort.

He is a prominent figure in the world of self-driving vehicles, having worked on the technology for more than a decade and achieving some degree of renown as a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, in 2004, when he designed a self-driving motorcycle that was entered in the Pentagon’s first contest for autonomous vehicles. Later, when Google began working on self-driving cars, it acquired Mr. Levandowski’s start-up, 510 Systems.

Mr. Levandowski left Google in early 2016 to found Otto with Lior Ron, who also was experienced in autonomous vehicle research and digital mapping. Waymo noted in its suit that the sale to Uber closed shortly after Mr. Levandowski received his final “multimillion dollar” compensation payment from Google.

Companies in Silicon Valley and Detroit are betting big on self-driving car technology. And the intense interest has spawned a string of expensive investments and lawsuits.

Last year, General Motors paid more than $1 billion for Cruise Automation, an autonomous vehicle technology start-up, and Ford recently announced plans to invest $1 billion over five years in Argo AI, an artificial intelligence start-up formed in December.

In January, Tesla filed a lawsuit against Sterling Anderson, a former director of the company’s Autopilot program, saying that he broke his employment contract by trying to recruit Tesla employees to join a new self-driving car company. Tesla’s suit, filed against Mr. Anderson and his partner Chris Urmson, a former Google employee, also claims that Mr. Anderson took proprietary information and tried to cover his tracks by destroying information.

In December, Google’s parent company, Alphabet, said that its seven-year-old autonomous vehicle project was spinning off from its research lab X and would operate as a stand-alone company called Waymo.

Alphabet said its decision to spin out Waymo was a signal that the company thought its self-driving technology had advanced beyond research project status and was ready for commercialization. Waymo executives have said it is open to using the technology in many ways, including a ride-hailing service to compete with Uber.

For Uber, Otto represents a significant bet on the future of transportation. Mr. Levandowski was named vice president of Uber’s self-driving technology, and he reports directly to Travis Kalanick, the company’s chief executive. Mr. Levandowski leads Uber’s Advanced Technologies Center in Pittsburgh, the epicenter of the company’s testing and self-driving efforts.

Uber has said it could be years before self-driving vehicles enter wide mainstream use. But the company has already deployed early tests in Pittsburgh and Tempe, Ariz., where the public can travel in prototype vehicles. In Fort Collins, Colo., Otto recently completed its first self-driving truck delivery, a 120-mile beer delivery for Budweiser.

In December, Uber ran into opposition to a test of its self-driving Volvo XC-90s in San Francisco, an operation the California Department of Motor Vehicles said was illegal because Uber did not hold the proper permits. One week later, Uber relented, redirecting its test to Tempe and pulling a fleet of its self-driving cars out of the Bay Area.

Uber, now privately valued at nearly $70 billion, has raised a dizzying amount of money from venture capitalists around Silicon Valley. One of its early investors was GV, the venture capital arm of Alphabet.

In August, David Drummond, a longtime Alphabet executive who was instrumental in GV’s $250 million investment in Uber in 2013, stepped down from his seat on Uber’s board of directors as it became increasingly clear the two companies were on a collision course.

It has been a difficult week for Uber. The company is still reeling from a blog post written by Susan Fowler, a former Uber employee, who claimed she was sexually harassed by a manager at the company and was ignored when she complained to the human resources department. The company said it was investigating Ms. Fowler’s claims and other concerns about a toxic workplace culture.

Mitch and Freada Kapor, early investors in Uber, wrote in a blog post on Thursday that they are frustrated with the company’s inability to change its culture, despite their attempts to help. They also expressed concern about the independence of the investigation, which will be led by Eric H. Holder Jr., the former United States attorney general, and Arianna Huffington, an Uber board member. Mr. Holder has been paid to work on behalf of Uber since at least 2016, they wrote, and Ms. Huffington’s board seat also compromises her independence.

The team announced Thursday that they had succeeded in breaking SHA-1, or Secure Hash Algorithm 1, encryption in a use case involving a pair of PDF documents.

What this means is that a method of internet security that has for years been known to be theoretically vulnerable has now been proven vulnerable. And what that means is there’s now a fire under the butts of entities still using the algorithm to finally update their systems to use something else.

Per its vulnerability disclosure policy, Google plans to release the code they used to break the SHA-1 encryption 90 days from now, at which point attackers will basically have an instruction manual for breaking the algorithm. Anyone still using it will be significantly more vulnerable.

“Moving forward, it’s more urgent than ever for security practitioners to migrate to safer cryptographic hashes,” reads a company blog post about the finding.

SHA-1 may be used to encrypt things like electronic documents (including legal documents), payment transactions, emails and email attachments.

The algorithm “is extremely widely used. We can’t quantify it, but SHA-1 is extremely widely used,” said Google researcher Elie Bursztein, based in Mountain View, explaining that SHA-1 has been used for many years “so a lot of people have legacy systems” that incorporate it.

The research was spearheaded by Marc Stevens, on staff at Netherlands computer science research institute Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica. Stevens said his SHA-1 research, funded by the Dutch government, began in 2009.

Google started working with Stevens in 2015, according to Bursztein. He said the company contributed resources pro bono, including infrastructure for computing, engineering time and expertise.

SHA-1’s usage stems back to as early as 1995, when the internet was just becoming mainstream with consumers, according to Stevens. But the cyber security community “didn’t know it was weak, really weak, until 2005, so there was no clear incentive to use something even stronger.”

Ars Technica, which reported on the finding earlier today, cited popular software development management system Git as a major entity that uses the algorithm.

Any software company that has been around long enough, including Google, will have used SHA-1, according to Bursztein. He said Google’s system for critical security does not rely on the vulnerable algorithm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While Jigsaw and its software are not new — the subsidiary has been around in some form since 2010, though with a different name, and Jigsaw software has even been used to spot potential ISIS recruits — this new Perspective API now makes it available to developers who want to use and build on top of the software.

The software works by determining the “toxicity” of online comments, a scale that has been established by mining millions of comments from the web and then presenting them to panels of 10 people (humans!) at a clip to get their feedback. There’s a demo version of the tool available on the Perspective API website, which anyone can use to type in a draft of their comments and get a sense of how toxic or abusive they might be (assuming one is thoughtful enough to go to the Perspective API website before they dash off their comment on an internet forum and leave a digital footprint for all of eternity).

Jigsaw’s software isn’t new, but now it’s accessible to developers

But its real value may come from being plugged directly into popular comment sections on the web. Publishers like The New York Times, The Guardian, and the Economist are experimenting with the tool, according to this report in Wired, and plan to use it as a way to keep their comment sections a space where “everyone can have intelligent debates.”

Certain phrases or quotes that have worked their way into the mainstream in recent months register fairly high on the toxicity scale, according to the Perspective tool. “Fake news!” registered as 47 percent similar to comments people said were ""toxic."" “Bad hombre” is 55 percent similar to comments people labeled as toxic. “Grab her by the pussy” was 92 percent similar.

But there also seem to be nuances that the tool isn’t picking up, which may just be a part of the “learning” process of the machine learning. In the spirit of testing Perspective, I entered some of the remarks that were left on a recent YouTube video I did. “How about Verge allow a man to review the watch?” someone wrote, which is blatantly sexist but only 3 percent similar to other toxic comments, according to Perspective. A negative comment about my appearance was only 6 percent similar to other negative remarks; it is somewhat reassuring that another YouTube comment, suggesting I have an eating disorder, was said to be 26 percent similar to other terrible remarks.

Wired’s Andy Greenberg had similar results when he ran Jigsaw’s software through its paces last fall, and pointed out that the “algorithm still has lessons to learn.” Which, apparently, is not too dissimilar from us humans.

The possible release date for the Samsung Galaxy S8 isn't the only thing that has leaked recently . Images of the device have also been showing up online. According to rumor, the new smartphone will feature a 5.8-inch AMOLED display, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage and a 3000 mAh Li-ion battery. It will also run Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOG , GOOGL ) Android Nougat mobile operating system.

Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , GOOGL ) may be interested in developing untethered VR headsets.

Alphabet Inc's Android operating system is being used in a new development kit from Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM ). The development kit is for untethered VR headsets that use Android, but it isn't the same as what users get from a smartphone.

The version of Android that is being used in the Qualcomm, Inc. development kit may give an insight into Alphabet Inc's future VR efforts . It has a separate overlay of its own. GOOG's current VR focus is with Daydream. This has users inserting their smartphones into a cradle for a VR experience.

The big difference between Alphabet Inc's current VR efforts and the development kit from Qualcomm, Inc. is the untethered aspect of it. Untethered VR headsets will operate completely on their own. Users won't need a smartphone or a computer to use them, reports Computer World .

Qualcomm, Inc. is hoping that its new development kits for untethered VR headsets will bring some sense of stability to the market. It is trying to ensure that different headsets are consistent. It also wants to reduce the nausea that can sometimes come with VR headsets.

The development kits for untethered VR headsets will come out during the second quarter of 2017. Qualcomm, Inc. is also launching an accelerator program to help original design manufacturers build their own untethered VR headsets. This includes giving these companies access to its own supply partners and assisting them with product marketing, Tech Crunch notes.

Choosing between buying Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is the classic choice between value and growth. And if you were confused, AAPL stock is the value play, while GOOGL stock provides the growth.

Source: Shutterstock

While Apple shares have been on fire in 2017 - up 17% - you can still get in for a price-to-earnings ratio around 16, lower than what investors are paying for the average S&P 500 stock. You also get a dividend of 57 cents per share, more than covered by earnings.

GOOGL is the growth play. Revenues increased to $90 billion last year from $55 billion in 2013. This justifies a P/E of nearly 30. The shares are also up 17% over the last 12 months.

Right now, investors prefer value over growth and Apple stock is doing better than Alphabet. But this isn't the proverbial choice between a rock and a hard place, instead, it's more like picking between cookies and ice cream. I own both stocks, I have owned them for several years, and I have profited handsomely holding both.

The Case for AAPL Stock

No technology company is as adept at squeezing profit from hardware as Apple.

While other smartphone companies struggle to make money, Apple regularly brings $1 of every $4 in iPhone sales to its bottom line. Its closed ecosystem is perceived as safe and their products last for years.

The current case for Apple stock, however, has little to do with hardware. Instead, services now drive the stock forward. Services like its app store - from which it takes a 30% cut of sales - Apple Music, iPay and iCloud have become huge, with $7.17 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter alone. The success of its services enabled Apple to become a power in the cloud by putting more than $12 billion into capital spending last year. It's no secret that the cloud is a capital-intensive business, but Apple has been able to out-spend cloud rivals without disturbing its profit machine.

AAPL had over $246 billion in cash on its books at the end of last year, most of it kept overseas. The Trump administration has proposed a one-time tax cut to encourage Apple to bring this cash back to the U.S. That's enough money to buy companies such as Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) or Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS ) outright.

When analysts subtract the Apple cash from its market cap, they find the company itself valued at ""just"" $460 billion, with a PE of 9 and just over two times sales. If you're looking for a cheap value stock, poised for an era of unprecedented growth, with plenty of safety and margin for error, they say, buy AAPL today.

The Case for GOOGL Stock

The artists formerly known as Google have a different case to make.

Alphabet has become a cash flow monster , delivering nearly $40 billion in operating cash flow last year. Its revenue grew nearly 20%, and GOOGL's operating margin is over 25%.

Clouds scale like no invention ever seen before, and Alphabet delivers a global search service for literally nothing. Its Android operating system is on 87% of all smartphones , against just 12% for Apple, and Alphabet doesn't have to build or sell them. It just watches as customers who own them come to its services.

But with no fanfare, GOOGL has also become a power in hardware. Its Chromebooks now outsell Apple's Macintosh line with about 5% of the PC market. Alphabet now participates in all the hardware markets pioneered by rivals - from virtual reality headsets to streaming devices - with watches and personal assistants that let you conduct searches of your home or the world with just your voice.

Under CFO Ruth Porat, who joined the company from Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ) in 2015, Alphabet is finally telling investors how much they're spending on ""other bets"" like robots and self-driving cars, and it's working to make money on those ventures.

The Bottom Line

It's hard to see a loser here.

The perceived threat to Alphabet is the growing balkanization of the Internet, with national governments seeking to control what people see and say within their borders, and who can profit from it. That has yet to impact GOOGL, but even the perception can hurt a stock.

AAPL is currently benefiting from a global flight to safety. Its enormous cash position, its strength as a luxury brand, and its growth in services, which could easily be expanded into competition in the cloud with companies such as Alphabet, are all seen in the best light right now.

If pushed to the wall and forced to buy just one right now, I would probably go with GOOG, the non-voting version of Alphabet stock, which shares equally in earnings but sells at a $20 per share discount to the GOOGL shares.

But both companies are like General Motors Company (NYSE: GM ) was in the 1950s, International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM ) was in the 1960s, and Halliburton Company (NYSE: HAL ) was in the last decade. These are their good old days. We know they will end someday, but that day is not today.

Revenue growth was driven by both the advertising segment, which includes display ads on Sina and Weibo, and non-advertising revenues, which include value added services on weibo.com. Additionally, Sina's company-wide gross margin (GAAP) for the quarter improved by almost 5 percentage points to 70% for the quarter. A higher proportion of advertising revenue across both portal and Weibo businesses was key to improved margins. Within the advertising segments, the contribution from small and medium enterprise (SME) customers was crucial to growth. (Read more: How Crucial Are Small & Mid-Sized Businesses For Sina's Advertising Business? )

A similar trend was observed through the year, as Sina generated just over $1 billion in revenues through the year, which was around 17% higher on a y-o-y basis. Top line growth came from both advertising and non-advertising (primarily from Weibo) while the company's gross margin for the full year stood at 65.6%, almost 4 percentage points higher than previous year levels. This was primarily due to expansion in advertising gross margins, as the gross margin for the non-advertising segment compressed by 170 basis points to 58.4%, as shown below.

The company has successfully improved operating efficiency, and its largely fixed operational costs led the company's cash operating expenses to stay flat over previous year levels. Continuing the trend from previous quarters, Sina reported roughly flat operating expenses for the fourth quarter and the full year as a result. Sina's non-GAAP operating expenses for 2016 stood at $498 million, only about 3% higher than the previous year. As a result, Sina's non-GAAP operating income was almost 200% higher than the year-ago levels at $179 million. This resulted in its non-GAAP net income increasing by almost 100% to $109 million for the full year.

Immediately after the U.S. elections, the consensus was to buy the small caps and financials. The money had to come from somewhere, so Wall Street sold mega-cap tech to chase the trend then. Stocks like Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) fell, but eventually recovered. GOOGL stock even set a new all-time high. Then came earnings season.

The reaction to GOOGL earnings was brutal - shares fell 6% in four days. Luckily, GOOGL bulls stepped in and defended the stock. As a result, Alphabet Inc has all but erased the entire post-earnings dip.

I've always said that the short-term reaction to earnings is purely a gamble. And that the longer-term fundamentals will eventually prevail.

My interpretation of Alphabet earnings is that the Google machine is still on rails! It prints money from multiple assets that have more than a billion users; management is a proven winner; and spending on crazy ventures has abated. Alphabet now even have official structures to profit from the self-driving auto arena.

So, for the long term, I have no real worry for GOOGL stock other than the general equity market gyrations. If markets sell off, so will GOOGL. Conversely, I don't expect shares to fall too far on their own from the company's own actions.

GOOGL Options Play

Options are liquid enough to allow me to set in motion trades with ample buffers that I expect to be sure winners given the current environment. The trick is to find a level where GOOGL stock will be defended by fundamental investors. Then I sell risk against those levels and sit back and let time work for me.

You've read the statistic that most options expire worthless. So I'd want to be a seller of options since the buyers lose most often.

The Bet: Sell the GOOGL Jan 2018 $660 put. This is a bullish trade for which I collect $13 per contract to open. The 20% buffer from current price gives this trade a 95% theoretical chance of success. Selling naked puts is dangerous. Not everyone is comfortable exposing themselves to such downside risk. If GOOGL stock falls below my sold put, I am committed to owning the stock at that level. So anything below $647 per share would accrue losses if GOOGL falls 30% or so.

Since risk tolerances vary, I will offer an alternate trade with similar metrics but with a finite risk profile. The alternate version would better fit smaller accounts, too.

The Alternate: Sell the GOOGL Jan 2018 $670/$660 credit put spread. This, too, is a bullish trade for which I collect $1.25 per contract to open. The price buffer is about the same, so the theoretical chance of success is still more than 90%. If successful, this trade yields 14% on money risked. I still need GOOGL stock to stay above my sold spread to win.

Usually, I like to balance my trade by selling opposite risk. In this case, I will offer the option to do that, but I will delay entry a little in this ""animal spirited"" equity market.

The Hedge (Optional): Sell the GOOGL Jan 2018 $1060/$1080 credit call spread. This is a bearish trade for which I collect $1.50 per contract to open. I need GOOGL to stay below my sold strike to win. There is no $10 wide spread available yet, so I can't make it a perfect iron condor. This trade, if successful, can yield 8% on money risked.

Usually, in perfect iron condors, my potential yield would almost double because I can only lose on one side or the other. In this case, the two sides will balance, but not perfectly. I am not required to hold these options trades through expiration. I can close any of them for partial gains or losses.

(NYSE: MBLY) , an Israeli company that specializes in advanced driver-safety systems, has begun rolling out a new offering that will help the self-driving cars of the near future function in more areas -- and your next new car might be enlisted to help.

The new offering, called Road Experience Management, or ""REM,"" is a system that will create highly detailed maps that self-driving cars can use to back up (or double-check) the inputs from their sensors. It will use data collected by cameras on many new cars, starting with the 2018 model year.

This is a big deal, not just for Mobileye but also for its customers -- which include nearly all of the world's automakers -- and people who are hoping to have access to self-driving cars in the near future.

Mobileye's chief technology officer, Amnon Shashua, outlined the company's approach to self-driving in a presentation last month. Image source: Mobileye N.V.

The problem: Self-driving cars need special maps

When the first fully self-driving cars arrive on the market in a few years, their capabilities will be limited. In most cases, the cars will be ""geofenced,"" restricted to driving in particular areas. (In the widely used industry nomenclature, these are called ""Level 4"" systems. ""Level 5"" systems that are self-driving with no restrictions are probably still many years away.)

The cars will be geofenced because most of the self-driving systems under development require specialized high-definition maps to work safely. The maps help the car's ""brain"" figure out exactly where it is relative to things like curbs and road barriers, providing a layer of redundancy beyond the car's sensors. (That may sound, well, redundant. But it's critical to ensuring that self-driving systems meet the required standards of safety.)

Obviously, the companies that can access the best and most extensive maps will have a competitive advantage. Cars equipped with their systems will be able to drive themselves to more places. That means that the race is on not only to create maps covering the widest possible areas, but to create ways to ensure that the maps are always up to date.

Mobileye has a direct stake in this race. It's gearing up to bring a Level 4 system to market by the end of 2019 , in partnership with Delphi Automotive (NYSE: DLPH) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) . That system will be marketed to automakers, who will probably be able to have it in showrooms (or in service with ride-hailing companies) by about 2021.

This self-driving test vehicle incorporates a prototype of the system being developed by Delphi, Mobileye, and Intel. Image source: Delphi Automotive PLC.

The partners will almost certainly have competition from companies like Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Waymo unit, Ford Motor Company 's(NYSE: F) Argo AI subsidiary -- and likely others.

Mobileye's Road Experience Management initiative is intended to make sure that its Level 4 offering is as complete, and as compelling, as possible. And your next new car might help.

How Mobileye will build -- and profit from -- the maps

The idea behind REM is that Mobileye can use the cameras on existing cars as a low-cost way to harvest the data needed to make the maps, as well as other information that will be useful to self-driving cars. Many new cars have front-facing cameras that are used for adaptive cruise control, lane-departure warnings, and other advanced driver-assist systems (or ""ADAS"") -- and many of those camera-based systems were sold to the automakers by Mobileye.

In recent months, Mobileye has been reaching out to its automaker clients, inviting them to join the REM effort by allowing data from their vehicles to be collected. In exchange, Mobileye is offering a share of the revenue it expects to generate from selling that data to mapmaking companies.

So far, Volkswagen AG and BMW AG have signed up to allow REM to gather data from their vehicles, starting in the 2018 model year. During this past week's earnings call , Mobileye's CTO Amnon Shashua said that his company expects to announce a third deal within a few weeks, and to have the majority of its automaker partners signed up by the end of 2017. (These deals include extensive privacy safeguards; the data won't be linked to specific car owners.)

Shashua explained how revenue will be generated from the REM effort:

We believe revenue will be generated from two separate products [of REM]. One is the map, which is a critical input to autonomous vehicle systems. The other is a broad set of real-time dynamic information such as traffic density, weather conditions and open parking spots. We expect the primary customers for each of these products to be mapmakers, and we recently announced engagements with both [high-definition mapping company] HERE and the Japanese mapping company Zenrin.

The upshot: An important step as the self-driving race shapes up

Assuming that a majority of the world's major automakers do in fact join the REM program, Mobileye's effort stands to put its venture with Delphi and Intel in a strong competitive position as the market for self-driving systems takes shape.

I've argued that the idea of a ""race"" to self-driving technology isn't a useful way for investors to think . Level 4 systems will be available to all automakers within four or five years; there won't be much advantage to the company that comes to market first. We won't be able to think in terms of ""winners"" until the details of the different offerings become clear.

That process is starting. REM makes it likely that the Delphi-Mobileye-Intel offering will have access to maps that allow it to operate in many areas of the world, right from the start. For investors, that makes the success of the partners' system more likely, and an investment in Mobileye -- the purest play of the three -- a little more compelling.

For Immediate Release

Chicago, IL - Is there a link between customer satisfaction and stock prices? We explore this idea in the latest edition of the Dutram Report where Eric Dutram talks with Kevin Quigg, Chief Strategist of ACSI Funds. Kevin's company is at the forefront of customer satisfaction research, and they have some great insights into the link between having satisfied customers, and satisfied investors too. To listen to the podcast, click here: ( https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/246643/is-customer-satisfaction-the-hidden-key-to-stock-outperformance )

As consumers, we have all been frustrated by companies which did not meet our expectations. Either poor service or a low-quality product, the end result was always the desire to do less business with the given company.

However, on the other side of the coin, there are those companies out there that go above and beyond, time and time again. Those are the companies I like to frequent, and I have always wondered if these types of firms-which have a long history of satisfying their customers-end up making better investments too.

Well, in this edition of the Dutram Report , I talk to Kevin Quigg, chief strategist at ACSI Funds, for some insights into this topic and if this idea works as an investment.

Inside ACSI

Kevin is an expert in the American Customer Satisfaction Index, a benchmark that exists to find companies that customers either like, or would rather avoid. This is done by looking at a few key areas of the customer satisfaction process, including customer expectations, perceived value, and perceived quality.

This data has proven to be extremely popular with companies, as it helps them to keep tabs on the competition and to see their relative standing among their peers too. But the data can also be used to shape the outlook for companies and to see how they are trending in terms of customer satisfaction, which can help to show which companies are moving in the right direction.

ACSI's idea is that customer satisfaction leads to customer loyalty, which leads to additional consumer spending which ultimately leads to long-term stock appreciation. This intuitively makes sense, and now there is a way to use this strategy in ETF form.

The ETF

This is via ACSI Funds' American Customer Satisfaction Core Alpha ETF ( ACSI ). This product holds securities that have high ACSI customer satisfaction scores, with the theory being that these will outperform their low-satisfaction peers.

Current holdings include well-respected names like Apple ( AAPL ), Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ ) and Alphabet ( GOOG ) just to name a few, though there are dozens of names in the portfolio. And if you are wondering what is done for sectors where customer satisfaction levels aren't as readily available, such as energy or materials, big ETFs-such as XLE or XLB -are utilized in order to give more broad market-like exposure.

Bottom Line

For a more in-depth look at this index as well as its investable counterpart, make sure to listen to the podcast for additional information. We highlight some of the strengths and potential pitfalls when it comes to this strategy, and how it might fit into a portfolio too.

So, make sure to listen to this edition of the Dutram Report for a closer look at this interesting strategy for tackling the equity world, and the potential for investors to exploit this simple idea for their portfolios.

(RTTNews.com) - Google is planning to significantly expand a carpool service on its navigational app Waze, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. The move indicates the company is edging closer to a potential clash with ride-hailing service Uber Technologies Inc.

Google is targeting launch of the Waze carpool service in several U.S. cities and Latin America over the next several months, Waze Chief Noam Bardin said in an interview to the Wall Street Journal.

Bardin reportedly said that the move to expand the carpool service comes after testing of the service in Israel and San Francisco Bay area met expectations.

In 2016, Google commenced a pilot car-pooling program around its California headquarters and later expanded it to San Francisco.

Waze promotes the service as Waze Carpool, noting that the service will enable to connect drivers with fellow commuters heading in the same direction. This is unlike Uber and its crosstown San Francisco rival Lyft Inc., which each largely operate as on-demand taxi businesses.

The Waze pilot program charged riders below the federal standard mileage rate of 54 cents a mile, thus discouraging drivers from making a living by operating as taxi drivers.

Nevertheless, Google's expansion into ride-sharing could intensify its rivalry with Uber. In 2013, Google had invested $258 million in Uber when the two companies were allies.

We talk a lot about self-driving cars, so I knew exactly where he was going with his question. He was hinting at the fact that both autonomous car technologies and ride-sharing services are advancing so quickly that by the time I'd be in the market for another vehicle, I might not actually need to buy one.

Image source: Getty Images.

By 2035, the IHS estimates there will be 76 million cars on the road worldwide with some level of autonomy . Even now, semi-autonomous cars that can keep themselves in their lanes, automatically brake in emergency situations, and slow down to match the speed of the car in front of them can be purchased for as little as $20,000.

And as genuinely driverless cars get cheaper and become ubiquitous, you and I may opt out of monthly car payments and opt-in to a monthly mileage subscription service instead.

Automakers are investing in this future

To understand how it's possible that we could soon live in a world where most people don't own cars, we need to look no further than what the automakers themselves are doing.

Elon Musk's recently updated version of Tesla 's(NASDAQ: TSLA) master plan includes details on a new service: When the company's vehicles become fully autonomous (by 2018 or 2019, according to Musk), Tesla owners will be able to allow their vehicles to drive themselves around and be rented out by other people.

As Musk wrote:

You will also be able to add your car to the Tesla shared fleet just by tapping a button on the Tesla phone app and have it generate income for you while you're at work or on vacation, significantly offsetting and at times potentially exceeding the monthly loan or lease cost.

Image source: Tesla.

Musk also said that Tesla would deploy its own fleet of driverless vehicles for rent in areas where there was more demand for Tesla vehicles than privately owned cars could meet, so that ""you can always hail a ride from us no matter where you are."" Remember, this isn't the catchphrase of a taxi company, nor even a ride-hailing service -- but rather the direction where Musk sees his automaker headed.

And just in case think this mentality is unique to the innovative Tesla, consider what General Motors (NYSE: GM) is doing. The giant automaker launched a ride-sharing service last year called Maven, which allows some GM owners to rent out their vehicles when they're not in use. The cars don't drive themselves yet, but the company sees it as a first step toward a future where people are less inclined to own cars.

In a press release at the time, GM said that more than 25 million of its customers around the world will use some form of shared mobility by 2020, and describe Maven as ""a key element of our strategy to changing ownership models in the automotive industry."" Maven has spread to 17 cities across North America in just 11 months, has 22,000 members, and has been used for 57 million miles of driving.

Not to be outdone, Ford (NYSE: F) has launched i ts own ride-sharing service, and is developing autonomous cars just like GM. Ford has made it clear that it intends to launch a ""high-volume"" driverless car paired with ride-hailing and ride-sharing services by 2021. The company is already testing 30 self-driving Fusion Hybrids in several states, and plans to triple the number of test vehicles this year.

Other automakers are moving in this direction as well. Fiat Chrysler (NYSE: FCAU) is working with Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google to test a fleet of 100 self-driving minivans that will be the basis for a ride-hailing service set to launch later this year. It's still unclear what the service will look like, or if Fiat Chrysler will play a critical role in it, but what is clear is that the automaker believes in the viability of Waymo's cars-as-a-service goal.

Will this really end car ownership?

It's hard to answer this question conclusively, of course. After all, most people haven't even seen a fully autonomous vehicle on the road, let alone ridden in one.

But John Zimmer, the co-founder and president of ride-hailing company Lyft, believes that by 2025 ""private car ownership will all-but end in major U.S. cities."" Lyft expects the majority of its vehicles to be self-driving by 2021, and rival Uber is testing similar strategies as well.

Others have set similar timelines for the demise of car ownership. Georg Bauer, who has held executive positions at Daimler, BMW, and Tesla told Business Insider last year that he thinks car ownership could be dead within five to 10 years.

Government regulations and our own apprehension about giving up control over our vehicles may preserve the widespread car ownership culture for longer than some expect. But what's crystal clear is that tech companies and automakers alike are betting on an automotive future that looks very different than today. Like many things, the transition from owning cars to renting driverless ones on an as-needed basis will likely occur in stages -- but let's be clear, things are certainly moving in this direction. And I, for one, would welcome a world without car payments.

I'm a firm believer in Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ). In the markets, there is an elite group of companies that define their respective industries. For example, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) owns e-commerce, while Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) has forever changed social media. And for now, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is the king of smart devices. But in my humble opinion, GOOGL stock tops them all.

Source: Shutterstock

Don't get me wrong as this is not a slight against any of the above companies. Just let me forward a very basic observation - all these other names essentially require the internet to function. If not directly, then certainly, access to the internet represents their core marketing message.

But what happens when you own the internet? That's a theoretical question to everyone except GOOGL.

As I mentioned in a prior contribution, the dominance of the GOOGL search engine is unparalleled. The margin between Alphabet Inc and the next biggest competitor, Bing, is a whopping 300%. It just gets worse as you go down the rankings. By the time you hit fifth place, it's just not even worth considering. In any other industry, such a statement would be the death knell for the competition.

Essentially, GOOGL stock is an investment in life itself. Many people thought that the name change to Alphabet - a play on the financial term ""alpha"" and the gambling term ""bet"" - was cheeky and a bit ridiculous. But it also signified that Alphabet Inc could do whatever it wants because no one can stop it. GOOGL stock was essentially either an asset or a threat, depending on your perspective.

Volatility Is a Risk to GOOGL Stock

Unfortunately, where it matters most for investors, GOOGL stock hasn't always shown its best stuff. True, it's early into 2017, and so far, it's up over 4% year-to-date. Keep that up every month and you're guaranteed a stellar annual return. But Alphabet Inc has also been inconsistent , as InvestorPlace contributor Chris Tyler points out. For example, GOOGL was looking at closing January at over 6%. Instead, it only secured 1.4%.

On a strictly nominal basis, that's not much of a swing. But on percentage basis, it's a much different story. It has been well over a decade since Alphabet stock introduced itself to the markets. The crazy dynamics involved in a fresh tech company should be over by now. Today, GOOGL and its subsidiaries are comparable to General Electric Company (NYSE: GE ) if GE was a little more hip.

But with great size comes great envy. Alphabet Inc now faces a fundamental problem. Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL ) wants to reengage a court ruling that went in favor of GOOGL. At issue is the company's generous use of Oracle's Java software in order to design the Android operating system. GOOGL contends that using Java - which is open-source - is fair game. Oracle contends that it violates the ""fair use "" component of copyright law.

For those that acquired GOOGL stock, it's an ugly situation that might be a legitimate risk. Here's the thing - whether it's legitimate or not doesn't matter. If the markets think it's a problem, it's a problem. That makes the sighting of what appears to be a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern (between early December until now) a curious development.

Don't Panic on Alphabet Inc

Generally, it's not the best idea to buy an investment with baggage. Certainly, it's not a good idea when the baggage is from a giant company like Oracle. Ditto that for its 6'3? CEO that doesn't come off as someone you want to mess with. In other words, GOOGL stock has some challenges.

I also don't think it's a coincidence that the head-and-shoulders pattern is emerging right now. If I'm looking at Alphabet Inc purely as a swing trade, I wouldn't go full bore at this juncture. I expect shares to at least test its 50-day moving average, which stands just under $800. It would not shock me, however, to see GOOGL stock slide towards its 200-day moving average, which is around $763.

Again, that's looking at Alphabet Inc from a short-term perspective. For those that have a wider time horizon, the king of the internet is as strong technically as it is fundamentally. Aside from some bumps in the road, GOOGL stock is enjoying clear blue skies. Most importantly, those bumps have never affected Alphabet Inc in a permanent way.

The bottom line here is that I would be content holding GOOGL stock. Further, any dips are justifiable buying opportunities, not mere contrarianism for its own sake. Alphabet Inc is going to $1,000 - just try to ignore the turbulence as best you can.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

Alphabet Inc’s Android operating system is being used in a new development kit from Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM ). The development kit is for untethered VR headsets that use Android, but it isn’t the same as what users get from a smartphone.

The version of Android that is being used in the Qualcomm, Inc. development kit may give an insight into Alphabet Inc’s future VR efforts. It has a separate overlay of its own. GOOG’s current VR focus is with Daydream. This has users inserting their smartphones into a cradle for a VR experience.

The big difference between Alphabet Inc’s current VR efforts and the development kit from Qualcomm, Inc. is the untethered aspect of it. Untethered VR headsets will operate completely on their own. Users won’t need a smartphone or a computer to use them, reports Computer World.

Qualcomm, Inc. is hoping that its new development kits for untethered VR headsets will bring some sense of stability to the market. It is trying to ensure that different headsets are consistent. It also wants to reduce the nausea that can sometimes come with VR headsets.

The development kits for untethered VR headsets will come out during the second quarter of 2017. Qualcomm, Inc. is also launching an accelerator program to help original design manufacturers build their own untethered VR headsets.

The company said that it is excited to tap into the potential of Waze, a ride-sharing app that has some similarities to Uber and Lyft, but it is ultimately a cheaper alternative to both. The first two tests took place in Tel Aviv and the Bay Area, and they were successful.

The Waze Rider companion app will be rolled out in a number of US cities over the coming months, as well as Latin America. The Google project first came to fruition in Tel Aviv, where it was developed.

As previously mentioned, Waze is cheaper and simpler than its rival companies as the plan is to see if the company can get people to pick up and drop someone off on their way to work. “That’s the biggest challenge,” the company mentioned.

A ride in the Bay Area is especially cheap on Waze as you can get from Oakland to downtown San Francisco for $4.50. The same trip with Uber would cost you anywhere between $10 and $12.

Waze has to be booked more in advance than its rivals and it may not be as reliable as other companies. Which one would you rather ride in?

Don’t get me wrong as this is not a slight against any of the above companies. Just let me forward a very basic observation — all these other names essentially require the internet to function. If not directly, then certainly, access to the internet represents their core marketing message.

But what happens when you own the internet? That’s a theoretical question to everyone except GOOGL.

As I mentioned in a prior contribution, the dominance of the GOOGL search engine is unparalleled. The margin between Alphabet Inc and the next biggest competitor, Bing, is a whopping 300%. It just gets worse as you go down the rankings. By the time you hit fifth place, it’s just not even worth considering. In any other industry, such a statement would be the death knell for the competition.

Essentially, GOOGL stock is an investment in life itself. Many people thought that the name change to Alphabet — a play on the financial term “alpha” and the gambling term “bet” — was cheeky and a bit ridiculous. But it also signified that Alphabet Inc could do whatever it wants because no one can stop it. GOOGL stock was essentially either an asset or a threat, depending on your perspective.

Volatility Is a Risk to GOOGL Stock

Unfortunately, where it matters most for investors, GOOGL stock hasn’t always shown its best stuff. True, it’s early into 2017, and so far, it’s up over 4% year-to-date. Keep that up every month and you’re guaranteed a stellar annual return. But Alphabet Inc has also been inconsistent, as InvestorPlace contributor Chris Tyler points out. For example, GOOGL was looking at closing January at over 6%. Instead, it only secured 1.4%.

The tech giant is expanding the service to its Waze navigation app in ""several"" cities across the United States and in Latin America over the next few months, the Wall Street Journal reports. The decision to enter the market came after a successful trial run in Israel and San Francisco.

The move makes Google a competitor for Uber — a company it was once allies with, notes the Journal (in 2013, Google invested some $258 million in Uber through its Google Ventures capital arm). However, it is important to note that Waze's services are still different from soon-to-be rivals Uber and Lyft. Instead of working as an on-demand taxi service, Waze ""wants to persuade regular drivers using its navigation app to pick up people who are heading in the same direction,"" the Journal reports.

""Can we get the average person on his way to work to pick someone up and drop them off once in a while? That’s the biggest challenge,” Waze CEO Noam Bardin told the Journal .

Waze's prices also differentiate it from Uber and Lyft. According to the Journal, a ride from downtown Oakland, Calif. to downtown San Francisco costs a mere $4.50, where the same trip using either UberPool or Lyft Line is $10.57 and $12.40, respectively. To prevent drivers from using Waze as their main source of income, notes the Journal , riders only pay drivers $0.54 per mile, which is the current IRS reimbursement rate .

But based on his rues, Buffett would never invest in an emerging industry like self-driving cars, and his competitive moat ideas don't necessarily hold water in this world. If you're a fan of the Oracle of Omaha, beware of following his investment philosophy into these three mistakes.

1. Focusing too much on size

Image source: Alphabet (Waymo)

Economies of scale are an important indicator for almost any company. As the logic goes, the bigger a company is, the greater its ability to cut per-unit costs. Ford's (NYSE: F) ability to keep its car costs lower than Tesla Motors' (NASDAQ: TSLA) , for example, isn't just based on the fact that it produces more economically designed vehicles. It's also due to the fact that Ford produced 1.5 million cars in the third quarter of 2016, compared to the 24,800 cars Tesla Motors delivered during the same period.

But scalability in the driverless car industry doesn't necessarily have anything to do with car sales. The automaker with the best technology may ultimately come out ahead. Technology is scalable at almost no cost. When Tesla Motors wirelessly uploads its latest software to its already-sold vehicles around the world, the company pays nearly nothing in per-unit costs. The race to build the best driverless car at this stage has much more to do with technology than with numbers of vehicles sold, and the quantity of cars a company has sold thus far isn't a indicator for which company is best placed to scale in the future.

2. Exaggerating the value of network effects

What network?

Network effects are often touted as one of the strongest competitive moats around. Facebook , an actual social network, perfectly defines the allure of the network effect. If everyone is using a specific product or platform, it can be extremely difficult for another company to make inroads.

At first glance, driverless cars seem to be an excellent opportunity to build network effects. If one company's cars all ""talk"" to each other as they navigate the roads, they'll get to their destinations faster and more safely than competitors' -- right? Wrong. Driverless car technology must necessarily take into account public safety, and unique, exclusionary networks fly in the face of a universal platform for safe self-driving cars. Automakers engaged in this space already know this; it's why Ford, Tesla, and others are equipping their driverless cars with the best real-world object detection technology available.

When Ford announced earlier last week that it would invest $1 billion over five years in Argo AI, it wasn't because the startup has thousands of self-driving cars on the road -- it was because the company's robotics expertise ""gives Ford a distinct competitive advantage at the intersection of the automotive and technology industries,"" explained Ford Chief Technology Officer Raj Nair in a press release. Likewise, Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) spinoff Waymo isn't relying on Google's treasure troves of data to guide its vehicles as they drive around. Instead, Waymo cars are equipped with sensors and software designed to detect obstacles up to ""two football fields away in all directions."" Ford, Alphabet, Tesla Motors, and others aren't interested in network effects in this arena. They're interested in their cars having the most acute local-area awareness they can contain.

3. Expecting government regulation to limit competition

Regular regulation

Regulation can provide some of the widest competitive moats around. If only one company is able to meet all the regulatory requirements of being in a business, it's essentially illegal for others to try to compete with it. The driverless car industry recognizes this, and is making moves to ensure a level playing field for all involved.

Alphabet, Ford, Lyft, Uber, and Volvo Cars joined together last April to create the "" Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets , "" a lobbying group whose stated mission is to ""work with lawmakers, regulators, and the public to realize the safety and societal benefits of self-driving vehicles."" These companies are interested in standardizing national policy with simple and low-cost barriers to entry for all interested automakers. So for Buffett fans looking to back the company with the strongest regulation-related advantages, know that some of the biggest names in the business are working proactively to push policies that ensure no company can ever build a regulatory moat.

Picking the right self-driving car stock

Warren Buffett is an incredible investor, but he doesn't have answers for every industry. There are many open questions around self-driving cars, and some companies are more poised to profit than others. Rather than sticking to one-size-fits-all investment mantras, equip yourself with the facts you need to know, make informed investments, and set your portfolio to auto-pilot for years to come.

Data source: Snap S-1/A and Yahoo! Finance *Based on the midpoint of Snap's expected pricing range.

Despite its relatively small valuation, investors will still be paying a huge premium for Snap based on its sales. Last year, the company brought in just $405 million in revenue. By comparison, Twitter brought in more than six times as much ($2.5 billion). Snap and its underwriters think a dollar of its sales is worth more than 10 times as much as Twitter's.

Granted, Twitter is expected to see sales decline this year, while analysts believe Snap could grow revenue around 150%. Still, Snap will trade at a huge premium to the still rapidly growing Facebook and Alphabet, which are expected to grow sales 37% and 18%, respectively.

But the IPO pricing is still attractive

Snap's IPO pricing is still somewhat attractive however, if but for one reason. It's nearly the same valuation as its last round of funding. Snap's trailing 12 months of revenue for that round was just $93.5 million. Snap will IPO at about one-quarter the multiple of its last funding round.

In that light, Snap's price looks much more reasonable. If some of the smartest venture capitalists were willing to invest when Snap's latest advertising products were still at their earliest potential, it may well be worth it for investors now that Snap has proven those products work. And if they can get it at the same price, so much the better.

You probably won't get Snap shares at $16

Unfortunately, it's highly unlikely you'll be able to buy shares of Snap at its IPO price on March 2. Since its planning to price shares around the same price as its last round of funding, Snap is potentially setting the stock up for a pop in the stock price before it opens on the New York Stock Exchange.

That's good for Snap. Even though Snap will only receive funds at the price it sets on March 1, a first-day pop in the stock price makes it look much more attractive. (Remember what happened to Facebook stock after its botched IPO?)

Snap itself is only selling 145 million to 175 million shares of the company's 1.2 billion shares outstanding, so it's not leaving too much money on the table, either, by keeping its IPO price low. The other 55 million shares will come from early investors and company officials.

If you're lucky enough to have a broker that's offering you a chance to get in on the Snap IPO price, it may be worth considering buying a stake in the company. Even at $16 per share, however, it's still extremely risky. But don't be surprised if Snap doesn't trade publicly for that price for a long time -- if ever.

The positive outcomes of discretionary disclosure are various and can benefit both companies and their shareholders. I will focus here on the benefits for the latter.

Whilst the mandatory disclosure is imposed by legislation or regulation (i.e. the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the U.S. and the European Transparency Directive in the E.U.), the discretionary disclosure consists of any additional information a company's management intends to provide the investors with.

Most of the studies show that a disclosure increase creates value for the shareholders. For instance, a study conducted by Standard & Poor's shows (see the chart below) that companies with higher transparency and disclosure (measured by the S&P transparency score) have a higher P/BV ratio.

Source: Standard & Poor's

The S&P transparency score takes into account the quantity of disclosure: the more information is given (i.e. information about ownership structure and shareholders' rights, information about board and management process, financial and operational information), the higher the score is. The same research also proves that firms with high disclosure and transparency have a lower market risk as showed in the chart below:

Source: Standard & Poor's

Other studies focusing on events such as the introduction of regulation (i.e. the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) also verified and confirmed that disclosure either mandatory or discretionary creates value for the shareholders.

A crucial role in conveying the disclosure to the investor is played by the Investor Relations.

The National Investor Relations Institute (NIRI) defines the Investor Relations as the:

""Strategic management responsibility that integrates finance, communication, marketing and securities law compliance to enable the most effective two-way communication between a company, the financial community, and other constituencies, which ultimately contributes to a company's securities achieving fair valuation"".

Based on this definition, we can assume that if a company supplies its shareholders with a complete, timely, reliable, punctual and adequate flow of financial information related to its business, it will definitely help investors make better investment decisions and allow its stock price to align progressively with its fair value.

In this sense, investor relations help share prices to achieve a fair valuation. Value gaps between market value and fair value tend to diminish because investors believe management can accomplish what it says through the disclosure ( management credibility).

A flat or negative quarter will not be an automatic sell signal because investors will seek for explanations by the management and, when convinced that fundamentals are still strong and growing, they will be more likely to hold their shares or even increase their positions because they trust the company's management and, today more than ever, in the fallout of financial crisis, markets run more on trust than money. As a matter of fact, the 2008 financial crisis and the ensuing five years of economic turmoil clearly revealed the insufficiency of disclosures, especially in the case of financial institutions.

More transparency

First of all, making more financial information available means more transparency for its investors who can make more appropriate and accurate investment decisions based on a larger amount of data to evaluate and compare.

Voluntary disclosure decreases the investor's information asymmetry to the extent of its usefulness. The degree of its usefulness depends on its relevance, reliability, timeliness, and clarity.

Moreover, the market tends to value more companies presenting clear and easy-to-understand financial statements than those filing complex and opaque ones.

Many are the communication channels through which investor relations can convey the company's disclosure to the financial community. The main channels employed are the press releases, investor and analyst meetings, earnings guidelines, investor presentations, and the Investor Relations page on the company's website.

Investors are often concerned not with past earnings, but rather with future ones, thus the way a company communicates that financial information through the communication channels mentioned above might convince or not the investors to buy its stocks.

In addition, investing in businesses which implement an effective voluntary disclosure policy means investing into firms managed by credible and reliable managers; in other words, transparency leads to credibility and trust.

More liquidity

The implementation of an effective disclosure policy aimed to reduce the information asymmetries between management and investors will entail a higher liquidity of the shares and increase the company's visibility, thereby attracting more analysts to cover the stock and more institutional investors to buy the company's shares whose price will eventually go up with a clear and obvious advantage for all the investors.

A more liquid stock also means a reduced bid-offer spread (the empirical measure of market liquidity) for the investors, which means a cheaper cost of trading. In conclusion, an effective disclosure policy reduces information asymmetry and increases liquidity in the equity market.

Lower debt

Increased liquidity also brings about a lower cost of capital, thus the company will have to bear a smaller burden of debt, which is great news for the company's investors.

The majority of studies have confirmed that the cost of capital decreases as the company's risk perception dissipates within the market and, as a consequence, the firm will be able not only to finance its investments at a lower cost, but also raise equity capital more easily. Ultimately, disclosure facilitates external financing, investments, and growth, which will be eventually reflected in the rise of the stock price.

By no surprise, the leading IT consulting firm Infosys ( INFY ) ranking among the three top companies for disclosure on its domestic market (BSE100) has approximately a 5.90% weighted average cost of capital vs. a 45.20% return on invested capital. In other words it can generate excess returns on the investments 7.6 times more than its cost of capital. Besides that, Infosys can sport a 10-year track record of consistent growth in sales, profits, free cash flow and dividends.

Stock price appreciation and lower volatility

Firms with high levels of disclosure have a higher association with stock price increase than those with low levels of information disclosure.

A very interesting study published in the "" Financial Management "" journal compares an investment made in high-disclosure companies with an investment made in low-disclosure companies, and it shows that the high-disclosure portfolio outperforms the low-disclosure portfolio by an average of 7% per year over a period of 14 years.

Other studies have proved that more transparent firms benefit from a reduction in the volatility of returns which for the investors means less risk and more stable returns over time.

The increase of liquidity attracts more institutional investors who generate more volume and therefore push the stocks' price up. In addition, the increase of the analyst coverage and the set up of target prices might also contribute in putting further upwards pressure on the stocks' price.

The status quo of disclosure and transparency in the corporate world

In 2014 Transparency International (( TI )), the watchdog that monitors the international corruption among countries and corporations published a ranking of the top 10 most transparent companies and the least transparent firms in the world among the 124 largest publicly-listed companies based on an index which takes into account anti-corruption programs adopted by the ranked companies and their overall organizational transparency. Seven of the top companies are from Europe while eight of the bottom 10 companies are from Asia.

(click to enlarge)

TI also published a report whose findings are very interesting but also surprising.

In terms of sectors, telecoms and oil/gas companies lead the way whilst consumer services, financial, tech and healthcare firms are the least transparent. Geographically, EU companies score highest in organizational transparency with an average of 54% and U.S. firms score the lowest at 24%.

U.S. tech giants Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Google ( GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and IBM (NYSE: IBM ) all score less than three out of 10.

Another American famous firm, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A ) (BRK.B), Warren Buffett's conglomerate, also had a bad performance, ranking among the last 10.

""Tech companies are driving changes that are making our societies more open and accountable. They should be setting an example for other companies on transparency"" said Cobus de Swardt, TI's managing director.

The report also shows the positive impact of strong legislation, with U.K. companies scoring 90% on average compared to 20% in China.

According to the report, financial sector companies still should be more transparent and accountable to the public if they want to win back public trust which is yet faltering.

The report urges multinational companies to seek more transparency by disclosing the subsidiaries through which they operate in different countries which are often impossible to trace. Obtaining this information through a country-by-country report is important since it would help people understand the impact of multinational companies in their own country. In addition, through a full disclosure of corporate holdings, investors can gain more knowledge of financial flows such as intra-company transfers and payments to governments.

While all the evaluated German companies disclose all their subsidiaries abroad, no Chinese company discloses any financial data in any of the 59 foreign countries where they operate.

In the country-by-country disclosure ranking, more than 50 companies scored an embarrassing 0% and only three performed above the 50% level, the pre-tax profits being the least disclosed financial information while the revenues being the most disclosed. Amazon, Apple, Google and IBM all fail to publish a full list of countries in which their subsidiaries operate.

The watchdog in its report also highlights the importance for the investors to be aware of the anti-corruption policies established by the companies they want to invest in since this information will help them evaluate better the risk associated with the investment. U.K. companies perform best on anti-corruption whilst Chinese and Japanese companies are the poorest performers in both dimensions.

In conclusion, investing in companies with a high rate of discretionary disclosure and transparency can dramatically increase the overall shareholders' value and substantially reduce the risk associated with the investment.

The company has witnessed strong growth in its transaction services and online video streaming businesses through the first three quarters of the year. Although Baidu's top line growth in recent months has been hindered by a revision in regulatory policy that drove down marketing revenue, the company has continued to witness strong growth in non-core revenue streams.

Outlook For Q4 & Full Year

Through the first three quarters of the year, Baidu's search services revenue growth has been hindered by a revision in regulatory policy that drove down marketing revenues through the quarter. In China, online ads and marketingpractices for medical, pharmaceutical, and healthcare products and services on online platforms now have to go through mandatory regulatory approvals. This trend is expected to continue through the December quarter as well, with the most severe impact expected in the coming quarter.

Baidu has witnessed solid revenue growth in two of its smaller revenue streams over the the last 2-3 years - its online video streaming platform iQiyi, which is similar to Netflix ( NFLX ), and transaction services. Both segments witnessed over 70% revenue growth in 2015, which was slightly lower than the triple digit growth in the previous year. Baidu has pumped in money to these divisions to develop the infrastructure for its video streaming and transaction services platforms to fuel growth. Furthermore, Baidu has also invested heavily in content acquisition costs, bandwidth costs for the video business and traffic acquisition costs for the transaction business, in addition to absorbing high marketing expenses for both. As a result, the revenue surge in these segments is complemented by operating losses. These divisions are likely to be operating at a loss over next couple of years as well.

Since Baidu has operated its streaming video business at a loss over the past few years, there were reports in December last year that the company could spin off the iQiyi division. Earlier last year, a consortium of investors led by Baidu CEO Robin Li wanted to buy out the iQiyi business for $2.3 billion, but later dropped the bid after investors claimed that the price was too low. Various market research firms and hedge funds estimate iQiyi's valuation at anywhere between $2.5 billion and $5.5 billion. More recently, Baidu announced that it has raised funding for the video streaming business which would help it acquire more content and help the company focus on long-term growth.

Baidu's management expects Q4 revenues to be around RMB 18.1 billion (or $2.7 billion at an exchange rate of RMB 6.67 per $1.00). As a result, full year revenues could be around RMB 70.4 billion or $10.7 billion, which is slightly lower than the Reuters' consensus estimate of around RMB 71.4 billion. For the full year, we expect the smaller revenue streams to drive most of the company's revenue growth.

Google ( googl ) disclosed its plans to customers and partners via email on Tuesday, but the news has not been announced publicly. The product has been around since 2008.

Existing customers can keep using GSS for the life of their current license, but Google will stop selling new licenses and renewals as of April 1, according the email viewed by Fortune . Once a customer's allocation of search queries is exhausted, the account will ""automatically convert"" to the company's Custom Search Engine, or CSE for short.

A Google spokesman noted via email that the company is ""winding down the Google Site Search product over the next year, but will provide customer and technical support through the duration of license agreements.""

He added that for GSS users whose contracts expire between April 1 and June 30, 2017, Google will provide a free three-month extension to their service with an additional queries.

CSE is a free, advertising-supported version of Google's search technology, that provides similar features and functions to GSS, according to the email.

Google recommended that GSS customers study the differences between the two products and that those who do not want to move to CSE can remove their existing search engine .

Google charged GSS customers based on the number of searches made annually. A small blog, for example, would get 20,000 searches per year for $100. A larger company might opt for 500,000 queries for $2,000 annually. Companies that wanted higher volumes of searches had to contact Google for pricing.

The news of GSS's discontinuation comes just over a year after Google announced similar plans to phase out Google Search Appliance, which bundled Google search into a piece of hardware that ran in companies' own data centers.

(RTTNews.com) - Google plans to end the unskippable 30-second ads on YouTube in 2018 and will continue with the shorter ad formats.

""We're committed to providing a better ads experience for users online. As part of that, we've decided to stop supporting 30-second unskippable ads as of 2018 and focus instead on formats that work well for both users and advertisers,"" Google said.

Meanwhile, YouTube will continue adverts with the unskippable 20-seconds adverts and the ones that can be skipped after five seconds. Last year, YouTube had launched the six-second unskippable bumper ad format, which it seems the company will use more heavily next year.

I love growth stocks as much as the next guy, but Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) might just be my favorite at the moment. That's because GOOGL stock has something that a lot of other high-growth dynamos simply don't have:

Any value left whatsoever.

I'm prudent when it comes to hyper-growth stocks such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX ). I've missed out on some great runs as a result, but I also haven't gotten burned when growth flags. Instead, I prefer to focus on ""growth at a reasonable price,"" or GARP - and I believe GOOGL stock falls into this category.

Go With GARP

With growth stocks, I look for a price-to-earnings ratio of a stock that is no more than 2x its earnings growth rate, if earnings are growing at 15% annually or more. And I want to back out stock buyback effects. To me, a GARP stock has a PEG ratio of 1.0, though I'll allow up to 1.5 depending on the earnings growth rate.

GOOGL stock trades at 29x FY16 earnings and about 21x FY17 earnings. Analysts see five-year annualized growth at 19.2%. So on the surface, Alphabet seems to qualify as a GARP pick.

But there's even more good news.

This doesn't consider the net cash position of GOOGL stock. See, I value a company net of its net cash hoard, just as Peter Lynch used to do. With $86.4 billion on its balance sheet, that pulls the market cap for Alphabet down to about $480 billion.

On $19.5 billion in net income for FY16, we suddenly find that Alphabet stock trades at 24.6 times FY16 earnings and only about 17.5 times FY17 earnings.

That's the first step for me in even determining if GOOGL stock is a stock to get involved in.

How Is Alphabet's Business?

The next thing I examine is how healthy Alphabet Inc's actual businesses are.

I still don't like the idea that GOOGL is basically a giant digital advertising billboard with a venture capital arm. However, I can't deny that Google's search engine holds an astonishing 80.47% market share . As long as four out of every five searches are conducted on Google, advertisers will throw money at Alphabet. There would have to be a scandal of monumental proportions, or some incredibly innovative new method of searching, to change this significantly.

Alphabet's 17% year-over-year increase in advertising revenue to $22.4 billion comes as no surprise.

So next I look at the YOY metrics, which look fantastic Aggregate paid clicks up 36%, paid clicks on Google properties up 43%, and paid clicks on Network properties up 7%. A lot of people freaked out that cost-per-click fell 15%, 16% and 19% for each of the above categories, respectively. The market doesn't seem to realize that this is because more advertising is being pushed to mobile.

As for Other Bets, which is basically the company's VC arm, I don't love that it blew a billion dollars in the quarter. But considering free cash flow was $6.33 billion, and net cash is $86.4 billion, GOOGL has that money to spend. With portfolio strategy, all it takes is one of these VC bets to hit, and all that money spent will be made back and more.

This brief glance tells me that Alphabet is an advertising business with dominant market share that is literally printing money. I mean, it generated $26 billion in free cash flow in FY16. That's free cash flow, meaning it can do whatever it wants with it.

That's even after spending about $10 billion in capex.

Bottom Line on GOOGL Stock

Normally, I would continue to examine other parts of the business if I were looking to include GOOGL in something like my forthcoming stock advisory newsletter, The Liberty Portfolio .

But for right now, I see enough to suggest investors continue their own due diligence and strongly consider GOOGL stock as a GARP play.

While sizzling summer days may seem far away right now in the northern hemisphere, tropical cities like Singapore deal with solar radiation on a daily basis.

Street trees -- keeping it cool

Trees and plants offer some relief, especially in urban areas with higher ambient temperatures, by providing shade and increasing evaporative cooling. Urban green spaces such as parks, gardens, and urban river networks deliver ecosystem services to cities reducing flood risk, cooling urban micro-climates, and creating recreational spaces. While it is generally accepted that trees and plants benefit urban environments, until now researchers have had very little data to work with in order to quantify the extent that street trees regulate urban ecosystems. Most of the research has been conducted in the temperate zones of Europe and North America, but little is known about how trees contribute to urban ecosystems in tropical regions. With urban populations exploding in megacities like Tokyo, Shanghai, and Delhi to well over 20 million people -- it is important to understand how green spaces contribute to urban sustainability.

Google Street View as an environmental dataset

Researchers in the Future Cities Laboratory at the Singapore-ETH Centre, a research outpost of ETH Zurich, developed a method to map and quantify how street trees regulate ecosystem services. Using nearly 100,000 images extracted from Google Street View, they analysed hemispherical photographs using an algorithm to quantify the proportion of green canopy coverage at 50 metre intervals across more than 80% of Singapore's road network. Google Street View's technology allowed researchers to tap into a standard dataset of panoramic photographs and streetscapes that use a global positioning system (GPS) to map images to specific locations. The high spatial resolution of the images allowed researchers to estimate the amount of solar radiation that reaches Earth's surface. ""In addition to cooling urban microclimates, these trees, which are integrated within dense urban street networks, also provide other benefits, such as reducing the risk of flash flooding and cleaning the air,"" says Peter Edwards, Principal Investigator at the Future Cities Laboratory and Director of the Singapore-ETH Centre. Researchers on the project concluded that increasing the cover of the street tree canopy could reduce ground surface and air temperatures on Singapore's streets. In addition, the relative quantity of the canopy may also serve as an indicator of evaporative cooling from leaves and rainfall interception.

Thermal comfort in green cities

""The study shows that trees are extremely important in providing shade in Singapore, and this shade could improve thermal comfort for people. Providing trees to help cool the environment is particularly important in tropical cities like Singapore, which suffers heavily from the urban heat island effect,"" says Dan Richards, a postdoctoral researcher at the Future Cities Laboratory and the project's coordinator. This new and relatively inexpensive method of rapidly estimating the amount of shade provided by street trees could help urban planners to identify areas of a city with low shade and prioritise the planting of new trees. Since Google Street View covers many of the world's cities, the method could be readily applied to quantify the proportion of canopy coverage and solar radiation in other tropical cities. If Google Street View images were collected during the growing season, the method may also be adapted to assess cities in temperate zones that experience a seasonal loss of tree leaves -- enabling the possibility of creating strategically greener and more sustainable urban environments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By Trevor HunnicuttNEW YORK, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Managers of BlackRock Inc's <BLK.N> largest mutual fund, fearing Trump administration policies could hurt technology companies with hefty foreign revenue streams, have reshuffled their top holdings, and it appears one of the first casualties is Google. Alphabet Inc <GOOG.O> has dropped out of the fund's top-10 holdings list after the $41 billionBlackRock Global Allocation Fund <MALOX.O> <MCLOX.O> pared back its near-half-billion-dollar stake in the parent of the leading search engine in January. Last year, Alphabet C-class shares worth about 1 percent of the fund's total assets were on its top-10 list. The Global Allocation Fund holds hundreds of stocks and also invests in bonds. The C-class shares have no voting rights. Alphabet's A-class shares <GOOGL.O> were not a top-10 holding of the fund. As of Jan. 31, the list still included other tech innovators, such as Apple Inc <AAPL.O>, Amazon.com Inc <AMZN.O>, Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and Facebook Inc <FB.O>, according to BlackRock's website. Global Allocation held about $443 million in Alphabet C-class shares, as of Oct. 31, down from $550 million the prior quarter, according to regulatory filings. The fund has held the stock since October 2015, according to Morningstar Inc. The latest disclosures do not make clear how much of the Alphabet stake has been sold. The 10th-largest Global Allocation holding, Pfizer Inc <PFE.N>, accounted for about 0.58 percent of the fund, which would work out to $237 million, suggesting the Google stake had fallen at least to that level. Alphabet did not respond to requests for comment. BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, declined to comment. ""Our enthusiasm for U.S. stocks is tempered by elevated valuations, a lack of fiscal policy specifics, and uncertainty regarding future U.S. trade policy,"" the fund's managers wrote in a summary covering their January trades. ""We reduced the fund's exposure to select technology stocks, including U.S.-based companies that generate a significant portion of revenues from non-U.S. dollar sources."" Alphabet earned 53 percent of its revenue outside of the United States last year, according to its earnings statements. The value was reduced by the U.S. dollar's strength against the British pound, euro and other currencies. U.S. President Donald Trump has touted a series of trade and tax reforms to boost domestic growth, some of which could also push up the U.S. dollar. A Republican proposal to reform taxes that would levy a 20 percent tax on imports and exclude export revenue from taxable income has been circulating. Trump has said he would announce his own tax plan in coming weeks.

If you're among them, don't worry. Here are some rules to help you build a bigger nest egg with an IRA.

What are IRAs?

As a refresher, you can get big tax benefits by saving money for retirement in a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA.

In 2017, you can set aside up to $5,500 of your earnings in either a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA or a combination of the two. If you're 50 years old or older, then you can save up to $6,500 of your earnings in an IRA.

IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.

Traditional IRAs can be funded with pre-tax money, which means that money you put in now isn't taxed at your current tax rate. Instead, that money, and any future gains, are taxed when its withdrawn. Because of this feature, traditional IRAs can make sense if you think your income tax rate in retirement will be lower than it is today.

Alternatively, Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax money, which means you're paying taxes on your contributions now so that you can withdraw them -- and future gains -- tax-free in retirement. Because of up-front taxation, a Roth IRA can make sense if you expect your income tax rate in retirement to be higher than it is today.

Some important IRA withdrawal rules

In the case of a traditional IRA, if you don't wait until you're at least 59.5 years old, the IRS will charge you income taxes on any money that you withdraw, plus a 10% penalty, unless you qualify for an early withdrawal exemption (more on that in a minute).

In the case of a Roth IRA, you can withdraw your contributions tax-free at any age without a penalty, as long as the Roth IRA has been established for at least five years. However, any gains that you withdraw prior to reaching age 59.5 can be subject to income tax and penalties.

Both traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs do allow penalty free, early withdrawals in specific instances. A full list of these exemptions can be found here , but the big ones to know about include purchasing a first home (up to $10,000), or paying college tuition for you, or an immediate relative, such as a spouse or child. The rules for taking advantage of these exemptions can be quite complex, so make sure you consult a tax professional before taking any early withdrawals. After all, the last thing you want is a surprise at tax time!

Overall, a Roth IRA might be a better option if you think you'll need to withdraw contributions five or more years from now, and you won't be 59.5 years old or qualify for an early withdrawal exemption at that time.

Navigating the IRA income caps

In order to qualify for a tax deduction on a traditional IRA contribution, your modified adjusted gross income has to be below set limits if you, or your spouse, are covered by a retirement plan at work. Similarly, in order to contribute to a Roth IRA, your modified adjusted gross income needs to be below set limits too.

Recently, fellow Motley Fool Matthew Frankel did a great job at explaining adjusted income limits for IRA's here , but in short, if you're single and you are covered by a retirement plan at work, you can take the full deduction on a traditional IRA contribution if your adjusted income is below $62,000 in 2017. You can qualify for a partial deduction if your adjusted income is between $62,000 and $72,000.

If you're single, you can make a contribution to a Roth IRA as long as your adjusted income is less than $118,000. You can make a partial contribution if your adjusted income is between $118,000 and $133,000.

If you're married filing jointly and covered by a retirement plan at work, then you can take a tax deduction on your traditional IRA contribution, as long as your adjusted income is below $99,000. A partial deduction is possible if your adjusted income is between $99,000 and $119,000.

If you're not covered by a plan at work but your spouse is, then you can make a tax deductible contribution to traditional IRA if your adjusted income is below $186,000 or a partial deduction if your adjusted income is between $186,000 and $196,000.

If you're married filing jointly, you can contribute to a Roth IRA as long as your adjusted income is below $184,000. A partial contribution can be made if your income is between $184,000 and $194,000.

If you think you're close to these limits and you're unsure of how to calculate your modified adjusted gross income, you can read up on the subject here .

How to invest in an IRA

Once you've contributed to an IRA, you'll need to pick some investments. There are a lot of choices, and you'll want to think carefully about your age, your health, and the number of years you have until you begin withdrawals.

If you're young, in good health, and have plenty of years to ride out the inevitable recession, then an IRA that includes stocks, stock ETFs, and stock mutual funds can make sense. Usually, buying and holding stocks and ETFs for long periods of time is cheaper than buying an actively managed mutual fund, so make sure that you balance the potential return, risk, and expenses associated with these choices.

Some investors may prefer owning individual stocks for the long term, such as disruptive growth companies like Amazon or Alphabet . Other investors may prefer owning an S&P 500 ETF that tracks the stock market's returns more closely. If so, a low-cost S&P 500 ETF that might fit the bill is the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO) . It has an annual expense ratio of just 0.05%.

It may also pay off to own dividend-paying stocks in an IRA. Because IRAs offer tax advantages, dividend payments can compound over time tax-deferred, or in the case of a Roth IRA, potentially tax-free. Historically, dividend-paying stocks have outperformed non-dividend-paying stocks. However, the performance of dividend stocks tends to be lower during periods of rising interest rates, when they have to compete with bonds for income investors' attention.

Overall, building a diversified IRA that includes exposure to stocks and stock ETFs can provide financial security in retirement. For example, if you're 30, and you contribute $5,500 per year for 35 years and earn a hypothetical 6% return per year, then you'll have a nest egg valued at $612,886 at age 65. That's not chump change, so make sure that you take advantage of this powerful savings tool.

Perhaps you worry that even if you did figure it out, you might not actually have the drive to go for it.

Meet Chloe Bridgewater, a 7-year-old girl living in Hereford, England. She probably won't grow up to have that problem.

Her dream job? Through her seven-year-old eyes, anyway, it's to work at Google. She saw some pics of the company's offices, ""with their bean bags, go-karts, and slides,"" her father, Andy Bridgewater, wrote in a post on LinkedIn, and that was all she needed to decide it was the closest thing to getting paid to be a kid.

Google Boss and Father Christmas

With her dad's encouragement, Chloe wrote a letter to Google's CEO. Here's part of what it said (her dad shared it with Business Insider.)

Dear Google Boss, My name is Chloe and when I am bigger I would like a job with Google. I also want to work in a chocolate factory and do swimming in the Olympics. ... My dad told me if I carry on being good and learning then one day may I will be able to have a job at Google. ... My dad told me to give you an application ... I don't really know what one of them is but he said a letter will do for now. Thank you for reading my letter, I have only ever sent one other and that was to Father Christmas. Good bye. Chloe Bridgewater, Age 7

Is there an opening for a vice-president of cuteness?

Adorable, right? (As an aside, what's up with kids always announcing their ages? Just once, for the sheer fun of it, I'd like to receive a serious job application signed something like, ""Howard McCarthy, Age 33."")

But I digress. As the elder Bridgewater went on to describe in his LinkedIn post, Chloe's letter elicited a response from Google CEO Sunda Pichai. (You can see Pichai's letter here. Business Insider says they verified its authenticity.)

Of course, it's short and sweet: ""I look forward to receiving your job application when you are finished with school,"" Pichai wrote.

Still, that little 6-line letter left his daughter ""delighted"" the elder Bridgewater wrote, and left her ""even more eager to do well at school"" (and to work for Google).

What you can learn from a 7-year-old

So, it's a cute story. But is it really unique? And if not, does it matter?

Because I highly suspect that a decade and a half ago, kids were sending cute little letters like this to Microsoft, and 30 years ago they were writing to Jack Welch at GE. Seventy years ago they probably wrote to Henry Ford.

The difference of course was that there was no social media for proud parents to show off their work to the world. But before you take a hard-hearted, cynical view of this story, consider the takeaways:

First, it's never too early to start networking. In 10 or 15 years when Chloe Bridgewater is applying for her first ""real job,"" she'll have a heck of an ice-breaker story.

Second, you never know how much impact a small act of kindness will have. Kudos to Pichai for taking the few minutes the letter must have required.

And finally, especially if you're stuck somewhere, trying to figure out what you really want out of life, remember this: If you never ask for what you want, you're not going to like the answer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(RTTNews.com) - Google Fiber, the high-speed Internet service of Alphabet Inc., is laying off several hundred employees as it transitions to wireless service instead of underground fiber-optic cables, according to media reports.

In addition, Greg McCray will reportedly be the new CEO of Access, the Alphabet unit that controls Google Fiber and other small Internet projects.

McCray is a long-time broadband executive and former CEO of Michigan-based Aero Communications Inc. He succeeds Craig Barratt, who stepped down in October 2016.

However, the latest job cuts will reportedly affect more workers than the October layoffs. Several hundred Access employees are said to be moving to new jobs at Google or other Alphabet companies.

Last August, the Wall Street Journal reported that Alphabet is rethinking its high-speed internet business after initial rollouts proved more expensive and time consuming than anticipated.

Google's announcement in 2010 of its Fiber project sparked high expectations at a time when telephone companies were perceived as moving slowly in rolling out faster broadband service. More than 1,000 cities applied and Google began service in the Kansas City area in November 2012.

Knowing how the Boston-based asset management giant has deployed the assets of shareholders in its stock mutual funds and balanced funds can help you make decisions about your own buys and sells.

For example, in the fourth quarter Fidelity trimmed its exposure to several big technology bellwether stocks. Not all Fidelity funds may act in lockstep, but overall the fund complex lightened its net share count in Facebook ( FB ) by 5.1%, according to Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF & mutual fund research for CFRA, an independent research firm.

Facebook is ranked No. 4 on IBD's Internet-Content industry group, thanks in part to a strong 91 Composite Rating from IBD and 87% average earnings per share growth over the past three quarters. 99 is the highest possible rating, which is on a scale from 1-99.

[ibdchart symbol=""fb"" type=""daily"" size=""threequarter"" position=""leftchart"" ]

Fidelity's Facebook holding is now at its lightest quarter-end level since the end of 2013, Rosenbluth says in a new report for MarketScope Advisor.

Facebook has rallied 16% since the beginning in a year to an all-time high. Subsequent disclosures by Fidelity will reveal whether it's been a buyer of Facebook shares in the current period.

The fund complex also trimmed its net share count in Google-owner Alphabet's C-class shares ( GOOG ) by 5.6% and its A-class shares ( GOOGL ) by 1.4%. Alphabet has rallied 6% so far this year. It faded after clearing the 816.78 buy point of a flat base on Jan. 23. It's retaken the buy point.

Graphics chipmaker Nvidia ( NVDA ) was a third tech big name to be trimmed by Fidelity. Fidelity also trimmed Salesforce.com ( CRM ), a provider of customer relationship management software.

IBD'S TAKE:Nvidia ranks No. 1 in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group, buoyed by a solid-gold 99 Comp Rating and six straight quarters of EPS growth acceleration. For details, check the stock's vital signs at IBD's Stock Checkup .

Still, tech remained Fidelity's biggest sector, accounting for 26% of the fund family's shareholders' money. That was an increase from Sept. 30's 24% and June 30's 23% weighting.

And many Fidelity funds, including some of its largest, remained owners of stock in which the overall complex made net trims.

For instance, now-$35.3 billion Fidelity Growth Company Fund (FDGRX) held Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft, Nvidia and Salesforce.com in its top 10 at year-end.

Tech-Sector Buys

And there were several tech names in which Fidelity made net increases in its share counts during Q4.

Fidelity boosted its share count in software giant Microsoft (MSFT) by 9.3% to 148 million shares. That was the highest share count since the end of 2014, Rosenbluth wrote.

That was the highest share count since the end of 2014, Rosenbluth wrote.

""A few other stocks that had double-digit percentage share increases include Autodesk (ADSK),"" Rosenbluth told IBD, referring to the developer of computer-aided design software applications.

Financials

Financials were Fidelity's second-largest sector, with 15% of shareholders' assets. That increase took place as Fidelity increased its exposure to some big U.S. banks.

Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) all saw double-digit percentage share count growth, Rosenbluth wrote. He added, ""CFRA thinks investor optimism for banks improved amid expectations for higher interest rates and regulatory reform.""

President Trump and Congress are widely expected to lighten the regulatory restrictions on some banks.

In addition, Fidelity made a double-digit percentage increase in its share count in Capital One Financial (COF).

The $414.3 million Fidelity Blue Chip Value (FBCVX) held Alphabet, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo in its top 10 at year end.

Industrials

Fidelity had a 9% weight in industrials as of the end of Q4. Fidelity managers made a 53% net addition to their share count in aerospace and defense contractor Northrop Grumman (NOC) in the quarter. They added 6.7% to their shares in General Electric (GE).

Telecommunications

Comcast (CMCSA) and Verizon (VZ) were two stocks in which Fidelity managers made double-digit share increases.

Tech was not the only space in which Fidelity funds made cuts. Fidelity managers made double-digit decreases to telecom titan AT&T (T), energy explorer and producer Chevron (CVX), medical products maker Medtronic (MDT) and to athletic apparel, footwear and equipment maker Nike (NKE).

Each of those decreases appears vindicated at this early point following the quarter. Comp Ratings for each of those stocks current range from an anemic 27 for Chevron to Nike's 59.

All of Rosenbluth's data applies to Fidelity's 232 stock and balanced funds (mixtures of stocks and bonds), which together hold nearly $1 trillion in shareholder assets, according to Morningtstar Inc.

Fidelity runs an additional 70 funds that hold bonds or commodities, accounting for an additional $233 billion in shareholder money.

We've all heard the argument that it's wrong to trade Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Many prominent experts rage over those who dare to trade around the price action of AAPL stock. It is confusing to investors to figure out who is wrong. Sure, I could spend a few hours parsing data and calculating returns while making assumptions of entry and exit spots. Or, I can accept the fact that they are both right to a degree.

On the one hand, it is undeniable that owning Apple stock for decades has been a winning proposition. But so was trading around the chop. It comes down to what works for each us individually. Most investors enter positions but get stopped out when things go wrong. So I will refrain from judging which group is smarter.

I found neutral ground using AAPL options. I commit to Apple long-term, especially when it falls out of favor, and leave myself room for error. I do so with no money out of pocket, thereby rendering my risk to a fraction of owning the stock.

Last month, I created $5 per contract out of thin air trading AAPL stock when it had appeared to be too late . Even more recently, I repeated for another $1.2 yield in mere days.

This strategy is easy to do on equities that are solid and what some would consider sure things like AAPL or Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ). I am less easy about doing this with say Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX ). With stocks that are perceived to be risky, such as Netflix , I would need to be pickier with my entry and exit points.

Today, I want to repeat performance regardless of which whale bought Apple or who sold it.

How to Trade AAPL Stock Here

The Trade - Long AAPL: Sell the AAPL 2018 $105 put for $2.70 to open. The 22% price buffer from current levels translate into a 90% theoretical chance of success. I only sell naked puts if I am willing and able to own AAPL stock at the strike sold. Some investors prefer spreading the risk into a credit put spread instead, and that works too.



Click to Enlarge I have been a longtime harsh critic of Tim Cook, so I don't count myself as an AAPL bull, but I do know how to do math. Apple's valuation makes sense at $100 or even $200 per share given current conditions. So I do trust selling risk against that fact rather than chase hope that Tim Cook is able to grow the company.

For now, he has a boulder that is hard to stop, and I can count on buyers to support the price.

I realize that markets are at all-time highs and precariously perched. So I could buy sacrifice puts in AAPL stock to guard against a market crash. For example, I could spend 20 cents buying the AAPL Jun $100 put to limit my loss if we fall off a cliff in the next four months.

I am not required to hold my trades through expiration. I can close it for partial gains or losses at any time.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) CEO Tim Cook has been talking an awful lot lately about augmented reality - or AR. The latest episode was last week, when he compared the technology to the iPhone in terms of its potential to be big.

Source: Nantic

After months of repeatedly playing up AR in public, it's beginning to feel as if Cook is setting the expectations of the press and public about the technology.

That begs the question: Is Apple Inc. planning a major augmented reality announcement?

AR vs. VR: What's the Difference?

Augmented reality is related to virtual reality - or VR - but the two are also very different.

Virtual reality uses technology to completely immerse people in a virtual world. This requires powerful computing hardware and special headgear. VR has spent several years as the next big thing, culminating with Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) buying VR pioneer Oculus for $2 billion in 2014.

Virtual reality hasn't quite caught on in a big way - the expensive and awkward equipment is a big hurdle to overcome - but gamers have begun embracing it.

So far, Apple has shown no interest in virtual reality and Tim Cook has actually made a point in several interviews of downplaying VR. In the latest, when Cook spoke to The Independent , he laments the fact that virtual reality ""closes the world out.""

""Most people don't want to lock themselves out from the world for a long period of time and today you can't do that because you get sick from it.""

The antisocial aspects of virtual reality, the equipment requirements and side effects such as motion sickness have been common themes in Cook's argument against virtual reality.

However, he is very excited by augmented reality and its ability to go mainstream. Instead of locking a person into a virtual world, AR overlays the existing world with additional information. One of the most popular examples of AR in action is the game Pokemon Go , released last summer. That game was the most downloaded app of 2016 on Apple Inc.'s App Store.

Is Apple Inc. Planning a Major AR Announcement?

Tim Cook's views on augmented reality seem to have been getting more positive in the past few months, reaching the point where he's actively hyping the technology. In October, he said :

""I do think that a significant portion of the population of developed countries, and eventually all countries, will have AR experiences every day, almost like eating three meals a day. It will become that much a part of you.""

And last week, he told The Independent :

""I regard it as a big idea like the smartphone. The smartphone is for everyone, we don't have to think the iPhone is about a certain demographic, or country or vertical market: it's for everyone. I think AR is that big, it's huge.""

What's holding AR back is the technology.

Hardware doesn't need to be as powerful as the silicon needed to drive virtual reality gear. And rather than a fully enclosed headpiece or goggles - that themselves are so complex they can cost $600 on top of the PC needed to drive them - augmented reality can be delivered through specialized eyeglasses or on a smartphone's display. The problem is current efforts haven't been quite good enough.

Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) failed Google Glass is the best-known example of the AR overlay glasses model, while Pokemon Go shows the relatively primitive AR experience that current smartphones can deliver.

What if Tim Cook has been playing up augmented reality (and dissing VR) because Apple Inc. is preparing to make a major push into AR? It could be the company that takes augmented reality mainstream by nailing the hardware, while everyone else is distracted by trying to get consumers to buy into VR.

There has been speculation that Apple is working with German optics firm Carl Zeiss AG on Apple-branded AR glasses . The iPhone 8 could also incorporate next generation hardware - from cameras to CPU and GPU - that are optimized to make AR a killer feature.

We'll have to wait until the company is ready to show its hand to know exactly what is up. But based on Tim Cook's continued promotion of the technology, it seems likely that Apple Inc. is priming us for AR-related announcement.

And if Cook is even close to being right about augmented reality having the potential to be as big as the iPhone, the upside for Apple stock could be huge.

Roughly half of American homes no longer have an old-school telephone, relying instead on cell phones and smartphones. If Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) have their way, home phones could become even more of a rarity.

Source: Amazon

A report in TheWall Street Journal suggests the companies are working on adding voice-calling capabilities to the Amazon Echo and Google Home smart speakers.

The Plan to Make Amazon Echo Your New Telephone

TheWall Street Journal is reporting that Google and Amazon are looking at an all-new use for their smart speakers: replacing the home telephone .

The idea makes sense. Telephones increasingly seem like outdated technology. Between smartphones and PC-based calling services like Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Skype, the days of the dedicated home phone seem numbered. In 2015, a survey by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (which, apparently, cares about these things) found that nearly half of American homes had given up their dedicated landline .

But, that still leaves a lot of telephones in operation.

Apparently, it's occurred to both Amazon and Google that smart speakers such as the Amazon Echo and Google Home may be the right device in the right place at the right time. Smart speakers get the name because they leverage an AI-powered personal digital assistant.

Amazon's Echo is home to Alexa, with over 5,000 skills . These devices have the smarts to take on telephone functionality. They could incorporate Skype, for example. And, Google has a slew of its own telephony applications it could leverage, including Google Voice and Duo.

The Amazon Echo and Google Home are equipped with excellent microphones, they have speakers, they are always connected (to the internet) and they respond instantly to voice commands, even from across a room.

So, as long as privacy isn't an issue (since using one would be like using a speakerphone), a smart speaker could replace a telephone and save consumers money by eliminating the monthly cost of a landline. While this would be a potentially useful trick for existing smart speaker owners, it's the kind of practical capability that could drive sales among those consumers who wouldn't otherwise consider a high-tech device like the Amazon Echo.

The Challenges of Turning a Smart Speaker Into a Telephone

While the technology and built-in smarts may be there, in reality turning that Amazon Echo on your kitchen counter into your home phone may not be quite that simple.

TheWall Street Journal article lays out some of the challenges. For example, there are potential privacy issues, not only in speaking out loud to the Echo (it lacks an AUX input, so you couldn't physically connect a handset), but the fact that now your telephone would always be listening to you and recording key data like phone numbers and call durations.

Amazon and Google would also have to implement a feature to prevent voice commands from being triggered during a phone conversation.

It's also been pointed out that switching from a cell phone or landline to an internet-based telephone service has implications for emergency services. For example, the FCC lists a series of limitations to 911 service when home owners rely on internet-based (or VoIP) services.

Calls may not be routed directly to an emergency center, locational information may not be available to emergency responders and, in a power outage, internet telephones go offline without battery backups.

Despite the challenges, The Wall Street Journal says its sources are convinced Amazon and Google will move forward, calling the move to telephone capability ""the logical next step for the artificial intelligence-powered speakers."" And, that move could happen later this year.

The question is, knowing that there are some privacy concerns and potential safety issues in doing so, would you ditch your landline and use an Amazon Echo as your home's new telephone?

(RTTNews.com) - Executives at Google's Project Loon, an ambitious effort to circulate broadband-emitting balloons across the globe, said they have found ways to run the program with fewer balloons. Rather than building a worldwide network, the team will now launch a small number of balloons into particular regions that need internet access. That will accelerate the project's path toward becoming an actual commercial operation, the Loon team said. The announcement is consistent with moves across Google parent Alphabet Inc. to curb costs at its riskier, expensive projects.

In 2013, Google ran its first tests for Project Loon. On Thursday, the company said that's not necessary anymore.

""We can now run an experiment with 10 or 20 or 30 balloons. The service has a much better chance of ultimately being profitable."" said Astro Teller, the head of X, the Alphabet division that houses Project Loon.

Loon engineers turned to the computing power of Google to improve the navigational system of the balloons, the company said Thursday.

One fear is that increasingly intelligent robots will take all our jobs. Another fear is that we will create a world where a superintelligence will one day decide that it has no need for humans. This fear is well-explored in popular culture, through books and films like the Terminator series.

Another possibility is maybe the one that makes the most sense - since humans are the ones creating them, the machines and machine intelligences are likely to behave just like humans. For better or worse. DeepMind, Google’s cutting-edge AI company, has shown just that.

The accomplishments of the DeepMind program so far include learning from its memory, mimicking human voices, writing music, and beating the best Go player in the world.

Recently, the DeepMind team ran a series of tests to investigate how the AI would respond when faced with certain social dilemmas. In particular, they wanted to find out whether the AI is more likely to cooperate or compete.

One of the tests involved 40 million instances of playing the computer game Gathering, during which DeepMind showed how far it’s willing to go to get what it wants. The game was chosen because it encapsulates aspects of the classic “Prisoner’s Dilemma” from game theory.

Pitting AI-controlled characters (called “agents”) against each other, DeepMind had them compete to gather the most virtual apples. Once the amount of available apples got low, the AI agents started to display ""highly aggressive"" tactics, employing laser beams to knock each other out. They would also steal the opponent’s apples.

Here’s how one of those games played out:

The DeepMind AI agents are in blue and red. The apples are green, while the laser beams are yellow.

The DeepMind team described their test in a blog post this way:

“We let the agents play this game many thousands of times and let them learn how to behave rationally using deep multi-agent reinforcement learning. Rather naturally, when there are enough apples in the environment, the agents learn to peacefully coexist and collect as many apples as they can. However, as the number of apples is reduced, the agents learn that it may be better for them to tag the other agent to give themselves time on their own to collect the scarce apples.”

Interestingly, what appears to have happened is that the AI systems began to develop some forms of human behavior.

“This model... shows that some aspects of human-like behaviour emerge as a product of the environment and learning. Less aggressive policies emerge from learning in relatively abundant environments with less possibility for costly action. The greed motivation reflects the temptation to take out a rival and collect all the apples oneself,” said Joel Z. Leibo from the DeepMind team to Wired.

Besides the fruit gathering, the AI was also tested via a Wolfpack hunting game. In it, two AI characters in the form of wolves chased a third AI agent - the prey. Here the researchers wanted to see if the AI characters would choose to cooperate to get the prey because they were rewarded for appearing near the prey together when it was being captured.

""The idea is that the prey is dangerous - a lone wolf can overcome it, but is at risk of losing the carcass to scavengers. However, when the two wolves capture the prey together, they can better protect the carcass from scavengers, and hence receive a higher reward,” wrote the researchers in their paper.

Indeed, the incentivized cooperation strategy won out in this instance, with the AI choosing to work together.

This is how that test panned out:

The wolves are red, chasing the blue dot (prey), while avoiding grey obstacles.

If you are thinking “Skynet is here”, perhaps the silver lining is that the second test shows how AI’s self-interest can include cooperation rather than the all-out competitiveness of the first test. Unless, of course, its cooperation to hunt down humans.

Here's a chart showing the results of the game tests that shows a clear increase in aggression during ""Gathering"":

Movies aside, the researchers are working to figure out how AI can eventually “control complex multi-agent systems such as the economy, traffic systems, or the ecological health of our planet – all of which depend on our continued cooperation”.

One nearby AI implementation where this could be relevant - self-driving cars which will have to choose safest routes, while keeping the objectives of all the parties involved under consideration.

The warning from the tests is that if the objectives are not balanced out in the programming, the AI might act selfishly, probably not for everyone’s benefit.

What’s next for the DeepMind team? Joel Leibo wants the AI to go deeper into the motivations behind decision-making:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(RTTNews.com) - Disney has cut ties with YouTube Star Felix Kjellberg, better known as PewDiePie, after he posted anti-Semitic videos to his channel. Meanwhile, Google'sYouTube has canceled the second season of PewDiePie's reality show ""Scare PewDiePie"". YouTube is also removing his channel from an elite Google Preferred ads program accessible to top creators.

The move follows a Wall Street Journal report, which inquired about a series of videos posted by him, which included anti-Semitic jokes or Nazi imagery.

Kjellberg, a big star of Disney-owned Maker Studios, has 53 million subscribers to his ""PewDiePie"" YouTube channel. The show was on YouTube's paid service, Red.

As per WSJ report, Kjellberg paid to the men to hold up the sign. The men apologized publicly in a video saying that they didn't really know the meaning of the message.

A Maker Studios' spokeswoman reportedly said, ""Although Felix has created a following by being provocative and irreverent, he clearly went too far in this case and the resulting videos are inappropriate.""

Meanwhile, Kjellberg on last Sunday acknowledged in a post on his Tumblr page that the jokes were ultimately offensive.

It was in 2014 that Kjellberg became a part of Disney after the media giant's acquisition of Maker Studios, a business that represents YouTube artists.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

All too much like James Cameron's 2009 sci-fi flick Avatar , just when you think the feud between Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL ) is over, you find out it's not.* Last week, the iconic database company told the iconic search engine company it was appealing a ruling made against Oracle - in favor of Alphabet - in May of last year.

Source: Shutterstock

For better or worse, GOOGL stock owners either didn't hear, or didn't care. If it's the latter, it's not terribly surprising. The company formerly known as Google is sued on a regular basis, often by parties with weak cases just looking for a payday.

GOOGL shareholders may want to take a closer look this time around though. While successful appeal cases are tough, Oracle's argument holds slightly more water than the typical long-shot case like the one Vringo levied (and ultimately lost) back in 2014 . Moreover, the case itself could have significant repercussions for other outfits in the heat of similar arguments about open source software.

GOOGL: Here We Go Again

Warning: You may need to read through the intricacies of this case twice to fully understand what's going on, and even then, there's no guarantee it will make complete sense. Here's the crux of the argument though … Oracle says Alphabet used a little too much of its Java software - which is free, open-source software - in its Android operating system.

The suit largely hinges on what constitutes ""fair use"" of open-source and freely-available software.

While Oracle offers Java for any consumer to download and any developer to utilize pieces of, the company contends it was never intended for wide swaths of the code to be cut and pasted and utilized as part of a commercial, revenue-bearing system. The complaint specifically read :

""The undisputed evidence showed that Google verbatim copied the heart of Oracle's creative work for an entirely commercial purpose without any change to Oracle's expressive content or message, took far more than necessary to program in the Java language, and, in so doing, harmed the market for Java.""

The strength of Oracle's copyrights on its application programming interfaces, or APIs, was particularly emphasized by the company in the prior jury trial.

Alphabet's counterargument is simpler - CEO Larry Page said , ""We didn't pay for the free and open things.""

If all of this rings a bell with GOOGL stock owners, there's a reason. This argument has been waged in a courtroom a few times, going back as far as 2010. The current stage for this battle of the titans is an appeal of last year's loss suffered by Oracle. That case's loss likely saved Alphabet Inc from being forced to pay the $9 billion in damages Oracle was seeking.

Bottom Line for GOOGL Stock, and Others

Owners of GOOGL stock don't have a great deal to worry about here. The courts sided with the company in the most recent case, and appeals - a reversal of a prior judgment - are very difficult win.

The case, though, will have far-reaching consequences beyond the Alphabet/Oracle tiff. In essence, this contest could largely help affirm just how ""open"" open source code really is even if its user ends up commercializing it as Alphabet did with Java via Android.

While not a legal matter raised during any of the lawsuits' arguments, all juror's minds were apt to be asking themselves why Oracle would offer Java in part or in whole for free - even for commercial uses - if it didn't want it to be used this extensively.

Another relevant but unasked question is why Java's original developer, Sun Microsystems, supported Android's use of the platform before Oracle acquired Sun, but Oracle switched gears on the stance after buying Sun Microsystems. And, perhaps if Oracle had been more clear about how its rampant use of it in the Android OS had ""harmed the market for Java"" when it's not really otherwise monetized, a judge and jury could have been a little more sympathetic.

As it stands though, the Oracle argument looks to be founded more on regret and frustration and less on merits. The courts so far seem to be picking up on that.

Broadly speaking, it all bodes well for other entities that have somehow commercialized open source software and APIs.

Not long ago, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) perfected the art of the big reveal. New Apple product announcements would be shrouded in mystery for weeks, and then the late Steve Jobs would get up on a stage and wow consumers and investors alike with the first-ever iPhone, the first-ever iPad or the first-ever iPod. AAPL stock would get an automatic 10% to 15% bump in the days that followed. Could Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) have a similarly secretive catalyst in its so-called Windows Cloud product?

Windows Cloud is a mysterious operating system that was revealed via leaks, prompting a ""nothing to share"" response from Microsoft last week.

What Is the Windows Cloud?

A couple websites posted screen shots of Microsoft's yet-to-be-announced operating system, which would only run Windows Store apps designed to run on both desktop computers and mobile devices. The thought is that the Windows Cloud would supplement, not replace, the company's Windows 10 platform, which is only 18 months old.

The Windows Cloud is already being viewed as Microsoft's answer to Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Chrome OS. And by utilizing only its own apps, the platform could have a security advantage over Chrome, which uses non-native apps. That could position Windows 10 as a more appealing option to public institutions like schools, where protecting students' computers from outside apps or games can be difficult.

Not much else is known about the Windows Cloud platform. And that's probably how Microsoft likes it. Although Wall Street didn't immediately embrace the top-secret new product by snatching up MSFT stock in droves, the real test will be when the company actually does its big Windows Cloud reveal. Will the platform impress enough to have an AAPL-like effect on Microsoft stock?

First, let's look at how MSFT stock has been behaving lately.

There was big spike in MSFT stock last month has since been followed by a sharp retreat; however, the stock is still hovering above its 25- and 50-day moving averages, as well as two-month support in the $62-range.

What you don't see is any kind of Microsoft stock price movement in the days since the Windows Cloud leak occurred. That means investors aren't quite sure exactly what the Windows Cloud is and how it could affect MSFT's business, which is why there has been no sudden rush to buy MSFT.

If more details leak out, that could potentially move the needle. For now, though, the Windows Cloud remains a relative mystery that likely has Wall Street more confused than excited.

MSFT Stock Is Strong Even Without the 'Cloud'

In the meantime, Microsoft looks good on its own merits. MSFT stock is up nearly 30% in the last year, nearly 50% in the last two years, still trades at less than 20 times forward earnings estimates, and is expected to grow earnings-per-share by more than 6% this year and more than 9% next year. Sprinkle in a potential game changer in the Windows Cloud, and there's no reason to suspect Microsoft stock is going to suddenly backtrack.

On the contrary, the recent mini-dip is a prime buying opportunity, so long as it holds above those short-term moving averages. I'd buy MSFT stock right here, with the hope that a future Windows Cloud unveiling could spark a quick run-up the way Apple's secret product launches used to.

Knowing how the Boston-based asset management giant has deployed the assets of shareholders in its stock mutual funds and balanced funds can help you make decisions about your own buys and sells.

For example, in the fourth quarter Fidelity trimmed its exposure to several big technology bellwether stocks. Not all Fidelity funds may act in lockstep, but overall the fund complex lightened its net share count in Facebook ( FB ) by 5.1%, according to Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF & mutual fund research for CFRA, an independent research firm.

Facebook is ranked No. 4 on IBD's Internet-Content industry group, thanks in part to a strong 91 Composite Rating from IBD and 87% average earnings per share growth over the past three quarters. 99 is the highest possible rating, which is on a scale from 1-99.

[ibdchart symbol=""fb"" type=""daily"" size=""threequarter"" position=""leftchart"" ]

Fidelity's Facebook holding is now at its lightest quarter-end level since the end of 2013, Rosenbluth says in a new report for MarketScope Advisor.

Facebook has rallied 16% since the beginning in a year to an all-time high. Subsequent disclosures by Fidelity will reveal whether it's been a buyer of Facebook shares in the current period.

The fund complex also trimmed its net share count in Google-owner Alphabet's C-class shares ( GOOG ) by 5.6% and its A-class shares ( GOOGL ) by 1.4%. Alphabet has rallied 6% so far this year. It faded after clearing the 816.78 buy point of a flat base on Jan. 23. It's retaken the buy point.

Graphics chipmaker Nvidia ( NVDA ) was a third tech big name to be trimmed by Fidelity. Fidelity also trimmed Salesforce.com ( CRM ), a provider of customer relationship management software.

IBD'S TAKE: Nvidia ranks No. 1 in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group, buoyed by a solid-gold 99 Comp Rating and six straight quarters of EPS growth acceleration. For details, check the stock's vital signs at IBD's Stock Checkup .

Still, tech remained Fidelity's biggest sector, accounting for 26% of the fund family's shareholders' money. That was an increase from Sept. 30's 24% and June 30's 23% weighting.

And many Fidelity funds, including some of its largest, remained owners of stock in which the overall complex made net trims.

For instance, now-$35.3 billion Fidelity Growth Company Fund (FDGRX) held Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft, Nvidia and Salesforce.com in its top 10 at year-end.

Tech-Sector Buys

And there were several tech names in which Fidelity made net increases in its share counts during Q4.

Fidelity boosted its share count in software giant Microsoft (MSFT) by 9.3% to 148 million shares. That was the highest share count since the end of 2014, Rosenbluth wrote.

That was the highest share count since the end of 2014, Rosenbluth wrote.

""A few other stocks that had double-digit percentage share increases include Autodesk (ADSK),"" Rosenbluth told IBD, referring to the developer of computer-aided design software applications.

Financials

Financials were Fidelity's second-largest sector, with 15% of shareholders' assets. That increase took place as Fidelity increased its exposure to some big U.S. banks.

Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) all saw double-digit percentage share count growth, Rosenbluth wrote. He added, ""CFRA thinks investor optimism for banks improved amid expectations for higher interest rates and regulatory reform.""

President Trump and Congress are widely expected to lighten the regulatory restrictions on some banks.

In addition, Fidelity made a double-digit percentage increase in its share count in Capital One Financial (COF).

The $414.3 million Fidelity Blue Chip Value (FBCVX) held Alphabet, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo in its top 10 at year end.

Industrials

Fidelity had a 9% weight in industrials as of the end of Q4. Fidelity managers made a 53% net addition to their share count in aerospace and defense contractor Northrop Grumman (NOC) in the quarter. They added 6.7% to their shares in General Electric (GE).

Telecommunications

Comcast (CMCSA) and Verizon (VZ) were two stocks in which Fidelity managers made double-digit share increases.

Tech was not the only space in which Fidelity funds made cuts. Fidelity managers made double-digit decreases to telecom titan AT&T (T), energy explorer and producer Chevron (CVX), medical products maker Medtronic (MDT) and to athletic apparel, footwear and equipment maker Nike (NKE).

Each of those decreases appears vindicated at this early point following the quarter. Comp Ratings for each of those stocks current range from an anemic 27 for Chevron to Nike's 59.

All of Rosenbluth's data applies to Fidelity's 232 stock and balanced funds (mixtures of stocks and bonds), which together hold nearly $1 trillion in shareholder assets, according to Morningtstar Inc.

Fidelity runs an additional 70 funds that hold bonds or commodities, accounting for an additional $233 billion in shareholder money.

For better or worse, GOOGL stock owners either didn’t hear, or didn’t care. If it’s the latter, it’s not terribly surprising. The company formerly known as Google is sued on a regular basis, often by parties with weak cases just looking for a payday.

GOOGL shareholders may want to take a closer look this time around though. While successful appeal cases are tough, Oracle’s argument holds slightly more water than the typical long-shot case like the one Vringo levied (and ultimately lost) back in 2014. Moreover, the case itself could have significant repercussions for other outfits in the heat of similar arguments about open source software.

GOOGL: Here We Go Again

Warning: You may need to read through the intricacies of this case twice to fully understand what’s going on, and even then, there’s no guarantee it will make complete sense. Here’s the crux of the argument though … Oracle says Alphabet used a little too much of its Java software — which is free, open-source software — in its Android operating system.

The suit largely hinges on what constitutes “fair use” of open-source and freely-available software.

While Oracle offers Java for any consumer to download and any developer to utilize pieces of, the company contends it was never intended for wide swaths of the code to be cut and pasted and utilized as part of a commercial, revenue-bearing system. The complaint specifically read:

“The undisputed evidence showed that Google verbatim copied the heart of Oracle’s creative work for an entirely commercial purpose without any change to Oracle’s expressive content or message, took far more than necessary to program in the Java language, and, in so doing, harmed the market for Java.”

The strength of Oracle’s copyrights on its application programming interfaces, or APIs, was particularly emphasized by the company in the prior jury trial.

Alphabet’s counterargument is simpler — CEO Larry Page said, “We didn’t pay for the free and open things.”

If all of this rings a bell with GOOGL stock owners, there’s a reason. This argument has been waged in a courtroom a few times, going back as far as 2010. The current stage for this battle of the titans is an appeal of last year’s loss suffered by Oracle. That case’s loss likely saved Alphabet Inc from being forced to pay the $9 billion in damages Oracle was seeking.

Bottom Line for GOOGL Stock, and Others

Owners of GOOGL stock don’t have a great deal to worry about here. The courts sided with the company in the most recent case, and appeals — a reversal of a prior judgment — are very difficult win.

Did you buy the post-earnings dip in Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) last month? Since hitting a low near $812 on Feb. 1, GOOGL stock has steadily bounced back, regaining more than 3% of the ground it lost following a poorly received fourth-quarter earnings report.

But you haven't missed out on the fun. Alphabet stock still has some gas in the tank.



Click to Enlarge Alphabet's bounce from the $812 region was not happenstance. The shares were bolstered by support from their rising 50-day moving average, and a wealth of psychological support from the nearby $800 area. Furthermore, GOOGL stock has been in rally mode since mid-2015, gaining some 53% during this time frame.

In other words, the post-earnings dip was less about poor quarterly results and more about an excuse to take some profits off the table.

However, now that the situation has corrected itself, and Alphabet stock has emerged from an overbought situation, shares should be poised to run higher.

If you took my bullish GOOGL recommendation on Jan. 31 and got into the March $830/$850 bull call spread, you are likely already at breakeven or sitting on a profit for the trade. What's more, the odds of breaking out above $850 have improved significantly in the past couple of weeks.

Alternately, if you took the more neutral-to-bullish option and entered the March $800 put sell, you can all but rest easy now that GOOGL stock is headed higher once again.

If you missed out on those trades, though, there's still time to get in before Alphabet Inc tops out again.

Sentiment for Alphabet remains as bullish as ever, with nearly all of the 48 analysts tracked by Thomson/First Call rating GOOGL stock a ""buy."" Additionally, the 12-month price target has risen over the past month to $990.72, and that bodes well for the shares going forward, as it cuts down on the likelihood of downgrades to ""hold"" over the short-term.

As for options traders, a bit of caution has crept into GOOGL options since Alphabet's quarterly report, but this, too, is healthy for the shares. Currently, the March put/call open interest ratio rests at 0.76, up from pre-earnings readings near 0.85.

Furthermore, peak March call OI rests well overhead at $900, meaning that Alphabet should see little in the way of potential options-related resistance.

March implieds have come down since the end of January, making GOOGL options cheaper. Currently implieds are pricing in a potential move of about 3.3% for Alphabet stock through March expiration. This places the upper bound at $868, while the lower bound lies at $812.

2 Trades for GOOGL Stock

Call Spread: If you missed out on the late January bottom, here's your chance to bet bullish on Alphabet heading into next month. I suggest the March $850/$860 bull call spread.

At last check, this spread was offered at $3.57, or $357 per pair of contracts. Breakeven lies at $853.57, while a maximum profit of $6.43, or $643 per pair of contracts, is possible if GOOGL stock closes at or above $860 when March options expire.

Put Sell: If you're still on the fence, or if you a neutral-to-bullish stance is more your style, then the March $800 put sell remains a solid trade that has a good chance of finishing out of the money.

At last check, the March $800 put was bid at $3.30, or $330 per contract. The upside to this put sell strategy is that you keep the premium as long as Alphabet stock closes above $800 when these options expire. The downside is that should GOOGL trade below $800 ahead of expiration, you could be assigned 100 shares for each sold put at a cost of $800 per share.

As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The author isn't sure just how descriptive the above statement is when applied to institutional money managers and investment analysts today. The ones we have spoken to seem to have a very detailed understanding of all the companies and industries they cover. The author does believe it accurately describes the average individual stockpicker.

Introduction

Investing, as practiced by the average investor, is a game rigged so the house almost always wins. Wall Street will take the average investor's life savings, and will do so dispassionately and unapologetically. This fundamental understanding is essential to engaging in buying and selling activity in the market.

""Investing is a zero-sum game. To buy a stock, someone else has to be selling. You are betting you know the company better than the person that is selling it to you. "" [ii] - Peter Lynch

Make no mistake about it, buying and selling stocks is a competition. It is serious, it is real, and if one is not constantly aware of this fact and doesn't take it seriously, one is apt to be a sucker. Someone is always trying to either sell someone else an overpriced security, or they are trying to buy another person's underpriced security for pennies on the dollar. That is what the market often is, [iii] an exchange to take advantage of the person on the other end of a transaction. This reality is not always appreciated, as one's competitor is rarely seen, but it is a competition all the same, and one with real financial stakes. Every single time you buy or sell a stock, there is somebody on the other side of that transaction betting you are wrong, and they are betting real money on it. They are also betting they know more than you, and they are trying to exploit your ignorance in the business underlying the security.

""There are rich teams, and there are poor teams, and then there's fifty feet of crap, and then there is us."" - Brad Pitt's character Billy Beane in Michael Lewis' Moneyball, speaking of the Oakland Athletics

What's more, the game most institutional money managers and Wall Street institutions play is stacked heavily in their favor. They have more resources than the amateur investor, better industry coverage, better contacts, better access to management teams, better technology, brilliant (and let's face it, more intelligent) analysts with more prestigious post graduate and doctoral degrees from the finest institutions in the country. Playing a game even remotely in this machine's wheelhouse is almost certain to be a disaster. The chances are that those institutions are generally on the other side of every transaction the amateur investor enters into.

If the reader is not yet discouraged, he or she should be. Forgetting the above facts and becoming complacent, or even arrogant, will not lend the sense of humility and caution that are necessary for successful stock picking. A measure of arrogance is necessary in picking stocks, but it must always be balanced with humility and awareness, and it is good only when logically supported by research and analysis. All of this brings us to a harsh truth that the reader will be wise to remember.

""Choosing individual stocks without any idea of what you're looking for is like running through a dynamite factory with a burning match. You may live, but you're still an idiot."" [iv] - Joel Greenblatt

If we accept Mr. Greenblatt's statement as true, and the author is a firm believer it is true, then why even try to buy and sell individual securities? Well, the real truth is that buying and selling individual stocks is generally only stupid if one engages in the practice in the way almost everybody always does. Put another way, there is a right way, and then there is the way nearly everyone does it. The right way is the exception.

Despite all the above, the amateur may still achieve results in excess of the majority of the professionals if the amateur insists on playing his or her own game on his or her own field. To make money consistently over the long term, the investor needs to only bet when the odds are in his or her favor; in other words, only when he or she has an edge over the competition.

How do we do that? The author will answer the question by posing a few questions of his own:

Wouldn't it be nice if undervalued companies that are profitable, with durable competitive advantages and reliable earnings streams, companies that may even be likely to compound over time had like a flashing light and loud noise going off to attract our attention, but only our attention (meaning most of the competition would miss the signs)?

Wouldn't it be nice if we could take the thing we are best at, that we know the most about, and we could place bets on that, and even then could choose to only bet when we were certain, or nearly certain that we will win?

What we will do in this particular article is to identify a specific ""edge"" that provides most investors a leg up over the large financial institutions and over the army of financial analysts on Wall Street. An edge is a place where the odds are stacked in your favor, through practice, knowledge, skill, time frame, or location. We will also provide real world examples on how to exploit these edges, but first, please permit us an analogy, to really drive the concepts home into the reader's grey matter.

Selecting Your Opponent…

I cannot help but remember my friend from London, in what is known as the East End . Mr. McDonald-Smith is a fairly large man of Jamaican descent, speaks fluent Spanish due to a couple of years living in the Dominican Republic, and is, as they say in England, quite fit. You know the type, someone with arms the size of their head where even an extra-large shirt is in constant danger of popping its buttons? Mr. McDonald-Smith can honestly boast that he has never been beaten in arm-wrestling. This feat is not overly surprising when looking at him, but how is it possible that one can have a 100% success rate in anything? Surely, there is always someone stronger, or more skilled, and even if there were no such person; doesn't everybody just have a bad day once in a while? In fact, Mr. McDonald-Smith is not an undefeated arm-wrestler because he is the strongest man in the world, nor is he undefeated because he is the world's most skilled practitioner of the sport. No, the fact is that Mr. McDonald-Smith is undefeated due to a very simple strategy that is designed to help him be successful.

What is his secret? It is quite simple. He never engages in a match with anybody that he isn't absolutely certain he can beat. In such a manner, he can honestly say he has never been outmatched. He never has, and so long as he continues in his strategy, he never will be. As he grows older, he will undoubtedly accept fewer and fewer challengers until one day he will retire completely from this activity, undefeated and triumphant. Why is this important? Well, Mr. McDonald-Smith has an edge in arm-wrestling. He is large of stature. He is strong. He is fit. He is smart. And he manages his ego. Taken as a percentage, the probabilities of encountering a formidable opponent are quite small. On the rare occasion that he meets such an opponent, Mr. McDonald-Smith graciously declines the match.

Now, here's the key to the strategy: It wouldn't work in a formal arm-wrestling tournament where one was forced to take on every opponent placed in front of him. In fact, it may be quite useless. While Mr. McDonald-Smith is likely to do quite well in a tournament, and he may even advance to the later rounds, he is unlikely to win simply because there is always someone stronger, or who has trained longer and more diligently. Luckily for Mr. McDonald-Smith, he needn't ever enter such a tournament. There is no reason to outside of ego.

What is the point? Don't play if (and when) you can't win.

Examples of Utilizing One's Edge

Now for some real-world examples to illustrate the value of investing in what you know, and using one's individual knowledge and skills to avoid losing money, and to achieve out-sized investment returns. As the author is trained as a tax CPA, these particular examples revolve around corporate income taxes. One needn't understand GAAP accounting for income taxes in order to understand the underlying point (If the author had been a used car salesman, we likely would have made some investments in car manufacturers or rental car companies (one could have made a lot of money investing in Budget, Avis, Hertz, Dollar, etc. if they understood the business). The point is to invest in what one knows and understands).

It does not take many home runs and grand slams to result in a satisfactory investment record if one does not lose money in the process. This bears repeating, with emphasis. It does not take many home runs and grand slams to result in a satisfactory investment record if one does not lose money in the process . That's not to say we try to swing for the fences. Most investors equate swinging for the fences with risk, but that is not the only way to hit a home run. When a perfect pitch comes along, a well-rehearsed swing can result in the ball just flying off the bat with ease. Likewise, sometimes, the most conservative investments can produce the most significant results; particularly if one understands the space and can recognize the opportunities and the risks. This also bears repeating. Sometimes the most conservative investments can produce the most significant results; particularly if one understands the space and can recognize the opportunities and the risks.

Vonage (NYSE: VG ) and Spectrum Brand Holdings (NYSE: SPB ) are both examples of the author finding signals in financial statements to reveal attractive investment opportunities. In both cases, our attention was drawn by the inclusion of atypical effective tax rates in the respective company's SEC filings. Because of our experience with accounting for income tax provisions in our day job, we were able to quickly identify and interpret these signals despite working fairly hectic schedules, and after a review of the rest of the financial statements and the companies' business operations, market positioning, management, and outlook, were able to open an investment in a fairly timely manner, which turned out to be key, as the shares appreciated substantially post purchase.

Vonage Holdings Corp. is an example of how experience in financial statement preparation, specifically the accounting for income taxes can lead one to a compelling investment thesis.

VG is a voice-over IP (( VOIP )) communications company (i.e. an Internet-based telephone provider) with catchy television advertising spots featuring either someone on the beach getting hit in the head with a flying box with the Vonage brand on it, or with various personalities declaring their independence from land lines by stating ""this is my last phone bill"" and then crumpling it up and tossing it into a massive pile in the middle of a warehouse, suggesting that everyone is doing it. It was a trendy IPO that promptly plummeted and lost 80% of its market value. Having, for years during college, used AOL's (AOL) dial-up Internet CDs that came free in the mail to access the Internet, we appreciated how the bargain basement telephone service that Vonage provided could be attractive to low-income users, particularly those with non-resident family and friends. Having also been an early fan of Google's ( GOOG ) ( GOOGL ) Gmail chat and calling features (now called Hangouts), we and our work colleagues were already adopters of the technology. We recognized that, much like AOL's dial-up CDs had previously, land-based telephone lines were fast going obsolete. The Company had paid down approximately $130M in debt, bringing its leverage to about 0.5x net income, and reducing its interest expense year over year by 2/3. The Company had a fairly clean balance sheet, stable revenue, new apps and overseas partnerships, so good news on the horizon. Add to that a swing to significant profitability, and the Company was trading at a PE of less than 5x and an EV/EBITDA of 3-4x. The Company looked cheap on those metrics alone, and there were no signs that business would deteriorate any time soon.

So where did our edge come in? What drew our attention to Vonage was the published effective tax rate (( ETR )). For calendar 2011 the ETR was a -375%, as in a benefit (another word for a tax gain, the recognition of which actually increases net income rather than decreases it) and not an expense. Now, in some situations, ETRs can be misleading, particularly when companies are operating near break-even, but Vonage was profitable in 2011 with pre-tax earnings of $86.3M. It pays to take a look at the footnotes and tax rate reconciliation in such situations to see what is driving the tax benefit.

We reproduce the Company's tax rate reconciliation below from its 2011 Form 10-K: [v]

Here we see that it was the release of a valuation allowance ((VA)) on the deferred tax assets (DTAs) that was driving the tax benefit (A valuation allowance is a fancy way of saying that an asset can't be recognized because it is uncertain if it will ever provide a benefit to the Company). By removing a VA, the Company is sending a signal that the benefit of the assets will be recognized, and the independent auditors must agree that such a position is reasonable. The next step then is to determine what deferred tax assets the Company is now benefiting from.

Again from the 2011 Form 10-K:

""Our net deferred tax assets primarily consist of net operating loss carry forwards (""NOLs""). We are required to record a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets if we conclude that it is more likely than not that taxable income generated in the future will be insufficient to utilize the future income tax benefit from our net deferred tax assets (namely, the NOLs), prior to expiration. We periodically review this conclusion, which requires significant management judgment. Until the fourth quarter of 2011, we recorded a valuation allowance fully against our net deferred tax assets. In 2011, we completed our first full year of taxable income and completed our budgetary process for periods subsequent to 2011, which anticipates continued taxable income in the future. "" [vi] ( Emphasis added)

To interject some commentary here, what this means is that, by the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company had not only just demonstrated a pattern of profitability, but it was projecting profitability in the future at least sufficient to recognize the NOLs as DTAs without an offsetting VA. So now we know the Company expects to continue its pattern of significant profitability, and will largely be able to avoid paying taxes during the lifetime of the NOLs. But what exactly does that mean? Let's continue, and remember that the below numbers are shown in thousands (000s), so for example, $300,000 is really $300 million .

""Based upon these factors and our sustained profitable operating performance over the past three years excluding certain losses associated with our prior convertible notes and our December 2010 debt refinancing, our evaluation determined that the benefit resulting from our net deferred tax assets (namely, the NOLs), are likely to be realized prior to their expiration . Accordingly, we released the related valuation allowance against our United States federal and Canada net deferred tax assets, and a portion of the allowance against our state net deferred tax assets as certain NOLs may expire prior to utilization due to shorter utilization periods in certain states, resulting in a one-time non-cash income tax benefit of $325,601 and a corresponding net deferred tax asset of $325,601 in the fourth quarter of 2011."" [vii] ( Emphasis added)

Accountants and attorneys love using run-on sentences. The $325M benefit they are talking about recognizing now that they are removing the VA is not how much income the NOLs are expected to offset, rather, it is the tax effected (think cash tax savings impact) amount of U.S./Canada taxes that will not have to be paid in the future. The gross amount of income the NOLs can offset is shown below:

""As of December 31, 2011, we had NOLs for United States federal and state tax purposes of $794,714 and $423,963, respectively…"" [viii]

One can see this activity occurring on both the balance sheet and the income statement. A quick review of the NOL expiration schedule in the tax footnote provides additional insight into the minimum projected profitability of the Company over the next 18 years.

So what did our quick check of the footnotes in the SEC filings yield? Not insignificantly, we discovered that the $326M tax benefit in calendar 2011 was due to the release of a valuation allowance on $885M of Federal net operating losses (NOLs) booked as an asset on the balance sheet. What this means, in essence, is that the Company was not only demonstrating an impressive return to profitability in the prior year (2011), but that it also had significant expectations of profitability into the foreseeable future. Generally speaking, independent auditors are reluctant to sign off on such a large tax benefit/VA release without compelling income projections and a solid history of recent earnings that are more than sufficient to offset the NOLs. We have seen exceptions to this of course, but provided the auditor is reputable, those exceptions are few and far between.

Bottom line; all else being equal, when a company with a $400M market capitalization and enterprise value recognizes a $326M GAAP gain due to the more-likely-than-not expectation of at least $885M of taxable income over the coming years, and then add to that the PE and EV/EBITDA under 5x and very little leverage, it's a good bet that company is worth a whole lot more than the current $2/share. It also may provide a competitive advantage over new market entrants that must pay taxes over the coming decade. The cash that would otherwise go to pay taxes may be used to amortize debt, invest in the business, repurchase shares, pay a dividend, or any number of activities management may think of to create value and increase earnings further.

With the Company's stock trading around $2 per share, and armed with the confidence provided by our edge in financial statement analysis (with particular focus on the income tax provision), and further armed with a sufficient understanding of the business in which it operates, we felt safe entering a position. The results were satisfactory, as illustrated in the share price chart below. Although the shares dipped not insignificantly immediately after our purchase, we took the opportunity to increase our position (remember, we could act with confidence because we understood what we owned, and what the Company and the auditors believed the future held). The shares doubled within the year, and have trended upwards since.

Lessons

When a company's shares are trading at an aggregate market capitalization of under $400M, is not heavily levered, and then that same company recognizes over $100M of annual EBITDA, $86M of pre-tax income, and on top of all that, books a $326M deferred tax asset for NOLs, that is a good sign that not only is the company expecting to earn income equivalent to the gross underlying NOLs prior to expiration, but also coupled with a clean balance sheet and sufficient cash that the company is worth looking at more closely.

Spectrum Brand Holdings was in many ways the opposite of Vonage, but our attention was attracted for much the same reasons.

""Decisions to buy and sell stocks should be based solely on the investment merits"" - Joel Greenblatt

Spectrum Brand Holdings owns a number of household brand names, including Rayovac Batteries, Black & Decker, Russell Hobbs, Black Flag, George Foreman Grills, Spectracide, Cutter, Repel, Armor All, STP, etc. SPB's debt-financed, acquisition spree in the 2000s resulted in a bankruptcy filing that wiped out shareholders in 2009. One can read more about the Company's background here . [ix] The Company was still recovering the following two years, when in 2011 we noticed the effective tax rate. We only even saw that as we were looking up Prestige Brands Holdings (NYSE: PBH ) and mistyped the ticker symbol. Incidentally, we ended up entering positions in both companies (better lucky than good).

""Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations is approximately 24% and 249% for the Fiscal 2011 Quarter and Fiscal 2011 Nine Months, respectively."" [x]

The impact to the tax rate reconciliation for the quarter was even more pronounced, in the event that a 249% effective tax rate wasn't enough to raise eyebrows.

Thus, whereas Vonage had recognized a large tax benefit due to the lifting of a valuation allowance, Spectrum was recognizing a large tax expense. This is generally not good. The question of course was why? Were earnings deteriorating? Was it merely do to a change in control? Were there not sufficient income projections going forward to offset NOLs? Reading further we got more information:

""At July 3, 2011, we are estimating that at September 30, 2011 we will have U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1,156 million and $1,006 million, respectively, which will expire through years ending in 2032, and we will have foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $143 million, which will expire beginning in 2011. Certain of the foreign net operating losses have indefinite carryforward periods. As mentioned above, limitations apply to a substantial portion of the U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards in accordance with IRC Section 382. As such, we estimate that approximately $299 million of our federal and $463 million of our state net operating losses will expire unused."" [xi]

That last bit about the §382 limitations really just says that due to one or more changes in control (i.e. ownership transfers of more than 5% of the company, which will generally occur in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization) that there is a limit to how much of the NOLs may be used in any given year, irrespective of profitability. For example, if the Company were to earn $1.2B in fiscal 2011 (implausible we know, but we are making an illustration), Spectrum would be limited to how much of the NOLs could be used to offset that income, and so on, and so forth until the NOLs expired.

""The ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets depends on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in the future and in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions. We establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when we estimate it is more likely than not that the tax assets will not be realized. We base these estimates on projections of future income, including tax planning strategies, in certain jurisdictions. Changes in industry conditions and other economic conditions may impact our ability to project future income. ASC 740 requires the establishment of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In accordance with ASC 740, we periodically assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized and determine if adjustments to the valuation allowance are appropriate. As a result of this assessment, we determined that a full valuation allowance is required against the tax benefit of our net deferred tax assets in the U.S. , excluding certain indefinite lived intangibles. In addition, certain other subsidiaries are subject to valuation allowances with respect to certain deferred tax assets. During the Fiscal 2011 Quarter we decreased our valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets by approximately $30 million. Our total valuation allowance, established for the tax benefit of deferred tax assets that may not be realized, was approximately $350 million and $331 million at July 3, 2011 and September 30, 2010, respectively. Of this amount, approximately $339 million and $300 million relates to U.S. net deferred tax assets at July 3, 2011 and September 30, 2010, respectively and approximately $11 million and $31 million relates to foreign net deferred tax assets at July 3, 2011 and September 30, 2010, respectively."" [xii] ( Emphasis added)

The Company's footnotes for fiscal 2010 [xiii] revealed somewhat more detail on the NOLs and their expirations.

Therefore, in contrast with Vonage, Spectrum did not anticipate being able to utilize its NOLs prior to expiration, due both to §382 limitations and/or insufficient taxable income against which to offset the NOLs. In addition, the Company was still fairly levered with $1.7B of long-term debt [xiv] on its balance sheet.

So why were we interested? Well, we liked the assets and brands, which were consumer goods with respectable, durable competitive advantages. Although not always the market leader (e.g. Rayovac was competing fiercely with Energizer and Duracell on the platform of ""equal or better value at a lower cost""), the value proposition and barriers to entry were considerable. In addition, due to the heavy debt load which required about $200M of annualized interest payments [xv] per year, the income tax provision was skewing the effective tax rate; therefore, net income (and hence the PE ratio) were, if not entirely worthless, not necessarily reflective of the Company's cash generation capabilities, nor the value of the entire business.

""Companies that spend money like drunken sailors, especially on acquisitions and real estate, are left with a huge depreciation allowance and a lot of debts to pay off, which gives them a high cash flow/low earnings profile."" [xvi]

The truth was the Company had significant operating income [xvii] and was throwing off significant amounts of cash before interest payments and debt amortization. [xviii] The ETR attracted our attention, but upon closer inspection, we became comfortable with the Company's value strategy, its place in the market, the growth in its earnings and cash flow, its ability to service and amortize its debt, and the defensibility of its business. All things considered, we initiated a position and determined to watch the year-end results [xix] closely.

SPB was trading in the $25 range prior to our entry. SPB has subsequently traded up to north of $130 per share. In this case, the ETR merely attracted our attention to a compelling investment possibility so we could study it further. It was a couple months later when the Form 10-K came out that we believed we had something really special. The Company had reduced its long-term debt by $180M from $1.72B to $1.54B [xx] and net cash provided by operating activities was $227M. [xxi] It seemed clear to us that the Company could service its debt load, and worst-case scenario could sell off one or more brands to de-lever further, but we didn't expect that would be necessary.

Further research into SPB prior to the shares taking off similarly revealed an interesting arbitrage opportunity via the shares of Harbinger Capital Group (NYSE: HRG ), where one could take advantage of the value gap in SPB at the same time as one could take advantage in the value gap in HRG. This is further discussed immediately below, and is really an extension of the same investment.

In 2010, Harbinger Capital Group controlled Russell Hobbs, and merged it with Spectrum Brands, leaving HRG with a majority stake in SPB. HRG also owned a valuable insurance company. HRG was owned primarily by Harbinger Capital Partners (NYSE: HCP ), a hedge fund that made billions betting against subprime mortgages during the credit crisis.

HCP and its founder, Philip Falcone, were at the time under indictment by the SEC, which alleged that Falcone had misused fund assets for personal use, and that HCP had engaged in unfair redemption practices, allowing favored investors such as Goldman Sachs to redeem partnership interests, while locking up other investors (Note these allegations were later settled). The indictment had the result of temporarily depressing the shares of HRG, in our view, understandably, but excessively given the nature of holdings and operations in HRG. One may read a little about this arbitrage play in the comments of the above referenced article on Spectrum Brand Holdings, reproduced again here . [xxiii] One may further read an article on this special situation here . [xxiv]

There was certainly some control risk in this arbitrage play, but during 2011, HRG actually traded at a value that was less than its publicly-traded ownership in SPB, giving a negative value to the insurance company. As SPB was similarly undervalued at the time, an investment in the undervalued HRG was another way to obtain the similarly undervalued shares of SPB at a significant discount to their trading value. This was just one of the odd, short-term arbitrage opportunities that occasionally arise in an otherwise efficient market. We held the position while the arbitrage gap narrowed, and then exited.

It is important to note a couple of items. We were not comfortable holding HRG long-term due to the ownership situation. We would have been comfortable holding SPB forever, and SPB has certainly performed better than HRG over the subsequent time period. Sometimes we can be too smart by half, as we then missed out on the subsequent run-up in SPB shares. Thus, it often makes sense to pursue the simplest course. Complexity often equates with risk. The arbitrage play did work, however.

It is instructive to note that both examples occurred after the recent bull market was well underway. The Dow had recovered from a low of around 6,000 to 11,000-12,000, and despite not yet recovering its pre-Great Recession level of 14,000, many prognosticators and value investors were opining that the bull market was running out of gas and that values were few and far between. In August and September of 2011, just a few months earlier, the market experienced a slight correction. By investing in what we understood, we were able to find all kinds of bargains after our initial purchases during the Great Recession had significantly appreciated, and this was during a period of time when many were fretting the direction of the market and that there were few if any compelling values available. In our own wheelhouse, we were nearly tripping over them in late 2011 and early 2012.

When Groupon Inc (NASDAQ: GRPN ) last reported quarterly earnings, the results were so poor that GRPN stock fell from around $5.50 to below $4 per share. Shareholders were blindsided when the company agreed to acquire LivingSocial. With LivingSocial closing quickly in the quarter, will Groupon surprise investors with that acquisition?

Source: Shutterstock

Groupon described LivingSocial's cost as not material, but it could still have a positive impact on the business. GRPN forecast revenue guidance for FY 2016 as high as $3.15 billion. EBITDA of $150 million to $165 million already surpassed the consensus estimates of $154 million.

Watch GRPN's Cash Flow

Groupon's third-quarter cash flow was down $53.7 million, due to restructuring and litigation costs. When the company reports fourth-quarter results on Feb. 15, seasonal strength may result in higher revenue.

Remember that this quarter will include Black Friday and Christmas. This is historically GRPN's biggest quarter of the year. The lower operating expenditures - thanks to cost cuts made last quarter - may contribute to a positive FCF.

Merchants who signed on during the holidays will add to Groupon's sales totals. Existing customers may have added more promotions. Since businesses take on risks but GRPN supplies the network of customers seeking a deal, it is a win-win for both parties.

Customers who are cash-strapped flock to businesses like Dollar General Corp. (NYSE: DG ). So long as Groupon is around to promote businesses through daily deals, its earnings potential will get stronger over time. GRPN stock trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 0.67x compared to 1x with Dollar General. Groupon clearly operates differently than companies like DG or TJX Companies Inc (NYSE: TJX ). The latter two rely on foot traffic in stores to drive sales. GRPN stock relies on merchants offering up deals and customers buying them online.

Expect Less Competition for Groupon Stock

Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ: AMZN ) exit from the daily deals market in 2015 should lead to higher revenue and lower costs for GRPN. Taking out LivingSocial removes yet another competitor. It takes several quarters before these factors show up in Groupon's bottom line. This is already showing up in the North American business. In the third quarter, sales in this region grew 10%, the highest in six quarters :

""That's most apparent in North America where our local business grew 10% year-over-year. The highest in six quarters, helping us deliver revenue of $720 million and adjusted EBITDA of $32 million.""

GRPN added a whopping 1.2 million new customers in North America, its highest in more than three years.

Part of this could be attributed to the fact that Groupon spent $88 million in online and offline marketing last quarter. Due to its scaled and accountable advertising platform, investors should anticipate customer spending growing proportionately faster than GRPN's ad spend.

Groupon said it had a cumulative 140 million downloads at the end of the third quarter. Further investments in this technology, combined with digital campaigns through Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) will further drive traffic to GRPN.

Portfolio Allocation to GRPN Stock

Given the speculative nature of GRPN stock, investors should not set a high allocation in it. Here is an example of a live trading account that returned 16.5% monthly.

Here are two other related trading strategies for GRPN stock:

Strategy 2 with GRPN giving a 5.5% monthly yield

Strategy 3 with GRPN, having a 5.3% monthly yield

Chances are good that the company had a solid quarter; therefore, Groupon stock could make a ""boom"" and reverse the downtrend on its share price.

As of this writing, Christ Lau did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

This podcast was recorded on Jan. 27, 2017.

Dylan Lewis: Welcome to Industry Focus , the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. It's Friday, Jan. 27, and we're breaking them quarterly results from PayPal and Alphabet. I'm your host, Dylan Lewis, and I'm joined in the studio by fool.com tech editor Sarah Priestley. Sarah, how's it going?

Sarah Priestley: It's good, it's a pleasure to be here, thank you for having me.

Lewis: Are you excited for pizza day?

Priestley: I am very excited. It's going to derail my New Year's resolutions, but that's OK. [laughs]

Lewis: That's a callback to your episode with the Vincent Shen. Are you finding that the Apple Watch is being helpful?

Priestley: Yes. It's definitely reminding me at 9 p.m. that I have done 0 steps, so I just end up walking around my living room like a crazy person.

Lewis: I do that when I'm on the phone all the time. That's how I get my exercise in.

Priestley: That's probably a good idea, yeah.

Lewis: So, Sarah, a ton going on in tech this week, the next couple weeks with earnings. Two pretty followed Fool companies reported yesterday after the bell. We dug into the reports and are ready to talk about them. You did some of the heavy lifting with PayPal; I dug into Alphabet. Why don't we talk about PayPal first. How did the results look?

Priestley: To give you an overview for the fourth quarter, earnings came in at $0.42 per share. $2.9 billion in revenue. Operating revenue was a little higher than expected at 21%. Transactions were $1.8 billion. But the volume was below expected. Expected was $100 billion and they delivered $99.3 billion. And that is why share prices are down about 3.5% this morning. So, it seems like a slight overreaction when you dig into their numbers. But, yeah, that's the reason for the share price falling.

Lewis: And that's really one of the core metrics that investors tend to focus on for them as a company, right?

Priestley: Absolutely. They really are measured on engagement, so number of customers, and engagement of those customers, and the key metrics for those.

Lewis: Looking beyond some of the top line numbers, what else popped up to you in the report?

Priestley: The operating margin for the fourth quarter was down to 15.4%. The reason that we're commenting on this is that that's a lot, it takes up a lot of room in the bullish theses, that the new partnerships they've started with a lot of the banks, Visa , Mastercard , they're going to really pressure their margins down.

Lewis: Is the thought there that they're working with very big institutions and big players, and they just don't have the negotiating room that they might with some smaller players?

Priestley: Absolutely. That's part of it. And also, it's just the standard transaction payment. It's the same thing for Square and other payment processors; it's a standard transaction amount on card processing. So, that 15.4% compared to 16.1% in the fourth quarter of last year -- you can see, that's quite a decline there. Management has talked about the fact that they are really doing everything they can to leverage their other income against this. And I feel like they've done a pretty good job. Their CEO, Dan Schulman, has said that they won't be a slave to quarter-to-quarter margin performance.

Lewis: Which is something we like to hear as Foolish investors.

Priestley: That's very true. And, I would also comment that the management team is really being driven for their compensation package on the long-term performance of this stock, and I think that really shows in their reporting. They're focused on free cash flow in their projects, and what they're delivering to their customers. Just to give you a couple of the year-over-year figures: Earnings per share for the year increased 15% to $1.15. Non-GAAP was $1.50 on guidance of $1.45 to $1.50. That's pretty good. Revenue for the full year was up 17%, and 21% on a currency-neutral basis, and they guided for 19%, so they really beat that.

Lewis: Like Alphabet, their fiscal Q4 comes with the calendar Q4, so we were able to look at full year results here, and not just the quarterly results. What's going on with total payment volume? I know that's something that people really like to focus on with them.

Priestley: Yeah, absolutely. If we had seen total payment volume less than 25%, I think we would have seen a bigger decline in the stock price. Luckily, for the fourth quarter, payment volume was up 25%. As I said, the actual processed amount was $99.3 billion, which missed the expectations. Interestingly, the majority of this was pushed by international. International expanded 27%. The U.S. was 23%.

Lewis: And for the unacquainted, total payment volume is just the gross amount that they are helping to facilitate.

Priestley: Yes. The way to look at this is, the total payment volume is the number of payments that they process. Then, the transaction is the amount that they process. So, they're averaging about $56 per transaction right now. That's slightly down from $60 that they were averaging a couple quarters ago. But it's still very good.

Lewis: So, for the amount per transaction to be down, they must be doing more total transactions to be making it up in volume and still be seeing growth, right?

Priestley: Yes, you're exactly right. I will also comment that, of their transactions in their Q4, $100 billion was mobile payments, which is an increase of 55%, and it's almost a third now of their transactions processed. Which is fantastic, and I think the management team has really isolated that as an opportunity for the company. That's where they're going to really demonstrate their industry leadership. The market is moving toward mobile, and they're really pioneering in the mobile industry.

Lewis: So what can people expect looking forward, either first quarter of 2017 or further out, broadly in 2017?

Priestley: Absolutely. I'll look for 2017 quarter four revenue we're expecting to grow on a currency neutral basis 16% to 18%. That gives you a range of $2.9 billion to $2.95 billion. That was actually slightly more conservative than some analysts were expecting, which played into their share price performance today. But full-year performance is strong, revenue growth 15% to 17% and 17% to 19% currency neutral, which gives you about $12.45 billion to $12.65 billion.

Lewis: Is there anything to worry about with some of these numbers that we're looking at, that management growth projections are different than what the market is expecting? Because, they are still very much in growth mode as a business, and I know that early on, those projections, if they start to decelerate at all, can start to scare people off a little bit.

Priestley: I think they have been fairly conservative in some of their estimations, because they really do have a huge potential with the mobile traffic. I think, if you look at some of their projects that they're working on now, Venmo has increased 100% year over year. It was Time Magazine's best app, it's processed $5.6 billion, which was up 126%. So, I think they have a huge potential with a lot of the projects they're working on; they've experienced huge growth. The problem with these is that they are not monetized yet. And an analyst actually raised the question in the earnings call: ""Is your projection in 2017 building in some of the expectations for monetizing this, and also Xoom?"" which is their international money transfer program. They dismissed this. They said it was pushing out to 2018, some of the opportunities, and that they will be focused on growth. So, I think, for 2017, these might be conservative estimates. But for 2018, we might actually start to see the fruits of that labor.

Lewis: Yeah, and you said, 55% of what was being processed, broadly for the business, was coming from mobile. When you look at Venmo specifically, that is almost entirely mobile. It's more peer-to-peer. There are some questions about whether or not they will be able to monetize that very well, and what that might look like, because me giving you $5 because you bought me lunch the other day, they don't really take anything on that.

Priestley: No, they don't. And something to say is, it's becoming a hugely crowded market. I think PayPal, to some degree, has a first-mover advantage, but they're definitely not the biggest player in this industry. The banks have gotten together and created clearXchange, which is a peer-to-peer payment which is also free right now. It's owned by the banks, so it has a lot of clout. Whether or not people pick it up to the rate that they've picked up Venmo, which is hugely popular with millennials, a lot of our friends use it all the time, we use it. Also, Apple . Apple has grown hugely. Tim Cook in his last earnings call -- so, this is a bit outdated -- said that 75% of swiping transactions were from Apple Pay.

Lewis: Wow. It's hard to believe. Anecdotally, though, when I'm out with my friends, and maybe you can lend some color on this too, if someone covers the tab, I'm paying them via Venmo. No one is ever like, ""Do you have Bank of America mobile payment processing?"" So, they do seem to have that first-mover advantage, and I think they have that name recognition. When you have that huge installed base, as they do, it really comes down to whether they can flip the monetization switch on. I guess investors are going to have to be patient on that, if management is pushing that out to 2018.

Priestley: Absolutely. I will say, they do have a lot of initiatives that are panning out for them right now. One Touch basically enables you to fill in your bank details, and you work through PayPal, and you can just click one button at the checkout and it's transacted through PayPal, which is hugely beneficial for mobile. I don't know about you, but frequently, when I'm looking at shoes online, as soon as I get to the card payment, and you have to zoom in on those small boxes and put your card numbers in, they lose me. I think it's something like a 74% cart-abandonment rate on mobile.

Lewis: So when people reach that checkout phase and they see that they need to drop in their credit card number, their security code, their address, shipping address, zip code, all that stuff, they wind up ditching it?

Priestley: Absolutely. But, PayPal One Touch, they have 87% conversion rate on mobile. That's incredible. They've had a lot of people starting to use that. They have added a lot of One Touch users. And, I think, of their merchants, about one-third right now are on One Touch. And they just launched this last year. So there's a huge potential here for them to really deliver on their promise. They've said they want to make customers' lives easier, and they're doing that, absolutely.

Lewis: Anything else that management provided color on with the business, and strategically where they're looking, that investors should know?

Priestley: I think the focus is absolutely on mobile. Dan Schulman has definitely commented on the fact that mobile is the biggest opportunity for them, and there are a lot of industry tailwinds that they're experiencing right now. And I would completely agree. I think Black Friday this year was the biggest online shopping day in history. In quarter three last year -- we're still waiting for quarter four -- the Census Bureau said that online retail made up 10% of all retail transactions. So you can see that if they are positioning themselves well to benefit from this, it should be a rising tide that lifts all boats.

Lewis: I know they've talked a little bit in the past about continuing to be an asset-light business. Is that something that management recommitted to in the most recent call?

Priestley: Yeah, absolutely. This is something that analysts have been focusing on. I definitely noticed a couple of questions about this in the earnings call. Square offers capital, it offers loans, as part of its services. It's not a huge part of their business, but it is a risk area of the business. So, in the fourth quarter, they had $123 million loss on loans. As a service similar to the company Square, which deals mostly with small businesses, but obviously this is individuals, PayPal has access to a lot of people's information and their spending habits and how much money they have. So they want to really leverage that information, and offer it out to partners to facilitate the loans using their information, which takes the risk away from PayPal, but they're still generating a percentage of income from it. So, overall, Dan Schulman commented that it's a really competitive environment for this. I think the payment space is just getting more and more competitive, every angle of it. But overall, I think this is definitely a good move for the company. It's the right decision, it's going to eliminate some risk. But it's also potentially going to bring in a degree of revenue too, if they can grow that segment.

Lewis: So, it seems like the general takeaway here is: Wait and see with a lot of the company's mobile initiatives. The core business seems to be humming along. There was a little bit of disappointment, but nothing thesis-altering, nothing crazy in the report.

Priestley: No, absolutely not. And they didn't touch too much on some of their partners. They've had some really high-profile partnerships with Alibaba , Vodafone in the U.K. and Europe, and many others; Discover , that they recently announced. They didn't touch on that too much, so we can't really give investors a good flavor for how that's going, only that it's in line with their expectations. So, yeah, I agree with what you said. I think mobile is going to be a big area of focus, we'll continue to have a look at those transaction volumes and customer engagement.

Lewis: So Sarah, I said that you did the heavy lifting on PayPal. I did most of the homework with Alphabet's earnings. I'm going to flip it over to you and let you host for the second half of the show.

Priestley: It's really nice to not be in the hot seat. [laughs]

Lewis: Yeah. I'll stop firing questions at you. It's my turn.

Priestley: So, yeah, Alphabet reported the same time, yesterday after the bell. What were the results?

Lewis: Overall, Alphabet's revenue came in at about $26.1 billion for Q4, up 22% year over year, which beat analysts' estimates of $25.3 billion. Earnings per share came in at $7.56, slightly lower than analysts' projections of $7.63 per share. I think the real story -- and what caused some of the immediate reaction for the stock -- was that adjusted profit missed by much more. That came in at $9.36 a share, versus expectations of $9.64 a share. We saw, after hours, the stock was down about 2.5% to 3%. That's what most of the market seemed to really fixate on.

Priestley: And what was the cause of that?

Lewis: Tax rate, basically, is the short of it. In Q4, Alphabet had an effective tax rate of 22%. They also highlighted their broad 2016 tax rate, because they're able to report whole fiscal year results as well. The company's effective tax rate for the year was 19%. That's a big bump. And you realize that average is also incorporating other quarters. You can get a sense of how much more they were paying out in taxes this quarter. Really, if you want to get down to the nitty-gritty, MarketWatch writer Jeremy Owen does a really good job breaking down the specifics, but the gist of the issue is, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued some changes a while back, basically impacting how companies can treat stock-based compensation for their adjusted earnings numbers. And that wound up impacting results for this quarter. Moving forward, the company will no longer be excluding stock-based compensation expenses from their non-GAAP results, which should smooth things out. But they wound up dealing with a little bit of a hiccup this quarter to reconcile.

Priestley: Yeah, that's really unusual, the change for GAAP there.

Lewis: Yeah. Typically, you think of non-GAAP numbers as being something where the Financial Accounting Standards Board gives people a decent amount of latitude to operate how they want to. But they like to rein things in every now and then, specifically with stock-based compensation because it's something that a lot of firms use to make their non-GAAP numbers look quite a bit better than their GAAP numbers, especially in the tech space. Looking at a couple of the different segments, their Google segment, which is search, ads, Android, Maps, Chrome, YouTube, pretty much anything that falls under their internet properties, came in at $25.8 billion. So, looking at a company with $26 billion in quarterly revenue, that's the meat of it right there. That is generally performing pretty well. Their Google Sites segment, which is the majority of that, was up 20% year over year. Network revenue up 7% year over year. Other revenue, which is a smaller portion a little bit less related to the internet properties within that segment -- think Hardware, Google Play, and their cloud segment -- was $3.4 billion, which was up 62% year over year. So, that's a very fast-growing segment within Sundar Pichai's Google area of the business.

I think, if you're looking for indicators for them, the two big ones that tell the story for the ad business and what's going on with some of the internet properties: Aggregate paid clicks, which is basically the number of times that people are interacting with ads online, was up 36% year over year. Aggregate cost per click, or CPCs, as they're commonly known, was down 15% year over year. This is not really a surprise. This is a story that's been playing out for a long time. We talked about the shift to mobile when we were talking about PayPal. The same thing is happening with internet search. CPCs have been driven down because the effectiveness of mobile ads isn't necessarily quite the same as it is for desktop. But for the longest time, Google has been able to make it up on volume. There's actually quite a parallel there with what happened with PayPal and the volume making up for the smaller transactions. We're seeing the same effects here with Alphabet.

Priestley: Would you suggest that's something that investors should include in their thesis going forward?

Lewis: I think it's something that, at this point, we shouldn't be too surprised by. This story has been playing out for a decent amount of time. If it really accelerates, you might have to worry. But they have been very good at making the volume make it work out. Eventually, mobile will need to find a floor somewhere, and enjoy that. But so long as we're still in that transition to mobile, I think we're going to continue to see this for a while, unfortunately.

Priestley: OK. What about the Other Bets segment? I know there have been some interesting moves this year.

Lewis: Yeah, this is something that people love to ask about, because it's like, ""Where is Google wasting all of this money?"" As a reminder, this is basically all the stuff they do that isn't tied to their internet properties. Think of it as their moonshot projects. The big financial contributors for this segment are Nest, Fiber, and Verily. They tend to focus on a full-year breakout for the segment because the numbers are so small relative to the overall business. But revenue came in at $809 million for 2016, which was up 82% year over year. Operating loss not including stock-based compensation was $2.9 billion, down slightly year over year. But, this segment is still a money pit for Alphabet, and I think it will continue to be. They have reined in costs a little bit under CFO Ruth Porat. I think she has forced all of the Other Bets initiatives to at least be able to show a path to monetization, or a road map to what that might look like. But I think there's a certain test-and-innovate atmosphere that they want to maintain. And investors have been OK with that, because their core internet business just prints money for them.

Something that is interesting with them and the Other Bets segment is, they spun out Waymo, which is their autonomous driving segment. For the longest time, that was the Google Self-Driving Car Project. A couple months ago, they said, ""This is a stand-alone business unit, and it will be nested within the Alphabet holding structure. It will continue to be in Other Bets."" And we didn't get any financial insight into what's going on with that. But they talked about it in the call. Ruth Porat provided some commentary on what they're basically doing with Waymo as a blueprint for what they will continue to be doing with Other Bets. Not a ton to report there, but this is something that Daniel Sparks and I talked about in a podcast when they announced that a few months ago. As we, in the next couple quarters, over the next year, continue to get more information about Waymo, I think we can look at that specific business segment and see the path for what's going to be going on for some of the Other Bets as they continue to mature and eventually see monetization. So, not a ton to report with Other Bets stuff, but at least we have something that we can start to track for what the company's ambitions might be.

Priestley: Absolutely. It looks like they're moving forward with that. Was there anything else in the numbers that stood out to you in the earnings call?

Lewis: I think some of the things that people need to keep in mind with this report, because the stock was down after hours, I think as of taping this morning, they were down 40 or 50 basis points, so not a crazy reaction like 3% that we saw after hours yesterday, but still down, I think people might be scratching their heads a little bit with some of the tax stuff they saw. Prior to the report, the company was trading at all-time highs. It's traded up for a while. I think it's somewhere in the teens in the last year or so. So, there's that. And also, Alphabet does not provide detailed quarterly guidance. Most companies do offer up that guidance, and analysts create their own models based on those numbers, those line items, and they have their puts and takes to tweak it slightly. But because Alphabet doesn't give those baseline expectations, the likelihood of actual numbers being different than analysts expectations is slightly higher than it would be for other companies. So, the market's reaction is always, I think, generally going to be a little bit sharper than what we might see for a company that does offer standard guidance.

Priestley: Yeah, because they have nothing ready to peg their estimates to.

Lewis: Yeah. They have the general trend of things and what they can glean from commentary. But very often, you'll see analysts' expectations more or less mirror guidance with slight adjustments. Not having that as a crutch can just add some unpredictability to things. I think that's the way you have to think about it.

Priestley: Any other little gems?

Lewis: Outside of the numbers, something that caught my eye that I think is a great point, and really underscores the importance of reading company conference calls, and not just relying on the numbers that you see reported and the quick earnings takes you'll see online: Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets in the Q&A section of the call asked this really great question, and I think it points to a looming risk for Alphabet, and I just want to highlight that for listeners. He said, ""It looks to me like Google devices are being outsold 10 to 1 or something like that in most homes. It's immaterial now, but you could see you in five years there's a new voice search interaction interface and it's not Google in the home. That could be a real challenge for the company."" And he was basically positing, ""What are you guys doing about all of the virtual-assistant and smart-home devices?""

Priestley: Yeah, great question.

Lewis: Yeah. And Sundar Pichai, Google CEO, he gave that generally positive answer, talking about the investments the company is making and how they're working toward voice search, and how they're trying to meet consumers in every situation that they might be using voice search, whether it be phones, TV, homes, cars, whatever. But really, at its core, Mahaney's question is getting at this idea of: Amazon's Echo devices are selling like hotcakes. If the installed base for them, or really any other virtual assistant, gets massive, and consumers start using those devices for the types of things and the purposes that people are generally using Google mobile and desktop search for, what does that do for your business? I don't want to be alarmist with any of this. I am an Alphabet shareholder, I really love the company. But I think he makes a good point. Earlier this month, actually, at an ad industry conference, there was an Amazon VP talking about some of the capabilities and some of the opportunities that Amazon might explore. That led some analysts to speculate that the company might be interested in exploring paid search with its Alexa product. This is not something that is a next-quarter, next-year issue. But over the next five to 10 years, we need to keep an eye on how people are using search, and how people are using home assistants or virtual assistants. Because, if we see that slowly eat into what would otherwise be desktop or mobile search, you have to wonder about how that might impact Google's core business, and really what prints money for them and allows them to fund all of these other projects.

Priestley: Yeah. And also, which products they're using. If everybody starts adopting the Google Nest, then they're good.

Lewis: Yeah. If people are using Nest or Google Assistant, then yeah, not a huge problem, that will keep them within that ecosystem. If they are using products that don't lean on Google search, and you have platforms that are able to monetize that search, Google might get crowded out a little bit. Again, Google did $26 billion in revenue this quarter. The vast majority of that was online ads. It's a huge market. I think people's more in-depth searching, or more research-based stuff, is always going to be on desktop or mobile. You can only glean so much from audio. But if you want the quick answer on something -- say you want to know who was the fifth president of the United States -- you can find that out with a voice search, and not really have to worry about being on mobile or desktop. And that's less impressions for Google Ad Search. So, it's something to keep in mind. Again, this is a five, 10-year risk. But, just, investors, keep an eye on what's going on with the virtual assistant market, because it's something that could impact Alphabet down the road.

Priestley: That's really interesting. I will hand the baton back to you. [laughs]

Lewis: Oh, you're going to let me wrap up? That's so magnanimous of you.

After all, Trump would frequently go onto the site to announce new plans or fight back against his detractors. It was (and continues to be) an incredible resource for political updates.

Now that Trump is President, his tweets move markets. His attacks on companies can send share prices lower in a heartbeat and are an important thing to consider for investors these days. Some have set up apps to track his tweets and how they relate to the market. Others do a tweet analysis in order to get better insight into the mind of the President, including The Atlantic'sTrump Tweet Tracker .

But beyond Trump, Twitter also managed to become the single greatest collection of primary sources of all-time. When breaking news happens, it is almost always reported first hand on Twitter, and then it is disseminated out from there.

You'd think that these factors alone would make Twitter an unstoppable media juggernaut. A must for journalists and those seeking to stay up-to-date on the news alike. So how has Twitter capitalized on this incredible timing and presidential stroke of luck? Well, in short, it hasn't.

Bad Earnings Report Again

The company posted yet another disappointing quarter for Q4, missing expectations on the revenue front and posting shockingly poor active user figures. It remains stuck around the 320 million active monthly user mark, and can't even seem to grow revenues either. Add in disappointing adjusted earnings guidance, and it isn't a great situation by any stretch for TWTR investors these days, especially given that the company has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

And let's remember, these figures are with the leader of the free world literally using the service to clarify policy and goals on a regular basis. The environment cannot possibly get any better for Twitter. Its product is in the news on a near hourly basis at this point and it still can't find a way to get the job done.

Clearly, Twitter needs a shakeup and it needs a bit of a Hail-Mary in order to get back into investors' good graces. So, what can the company do?

Twitter Needs to Copy YouTube. Now.

Fortunately for Twitter, the path to relevancy and growth is already laid out before them. The good folks at Alphabet ( GOOGL) ( GOOG) have already done all the hard work in their YouTube division and Twitter needs only to copy their best practices.

First and foremost is capitalizing on the incredible missed opportunity of getting an ad right on to tweets. As you can see in the picture below, there is always a big white box at the bottom right hand corner of each tweet.

Why not fill that with a small advertisement? Sure, some people are not going to like that, but people will adjust accordingly. We saw something similar with YouTube where at first only certain videos had ads, and now nearly everything has an advertisement before the video. People have adapted and it has become the norm to see this before a video. People will do the same with Twitter (and embedded tweets) and this will help with casual users (much the same way embedding helped with casual YouTubers).

After all, these casual users who mostly see tweets embedded somewhere else make up a huge base of people and are arguably the key to Twitter's success. Finding a way to make money off these people-much like how YouTube doesn't need you to be signed in or making videos to make revenue off of you-should be paramount in Twitter's near term plans.

According to Twitter, embedded tweets reach more than a billion people each month across the web, a truly massive figure. And that number is actually from before Donald Trump burst onto the scene and tweets were on the nightly news on a regular basis.

But what if people hate this idea and recoil from the service? Well, an easy way to placate people will be to pay the content generators for the work they are doing. Giving tweeters a slice of the ad revenue that they generate would go a long way to getting people and small businesses to tweet more, and it is pretty much akin to what YouTube does with their stars. And Twitter has even looked to do this on the video side , so why not extend it over to their bread and butter anyway?

Bottom Line

Are some of these ideas going to be popular? Definitely not. But Twitter needs to try something in order to jumpstart its floundering share price and lackluster growth. Everything needs to be on the table, and now is the time to do it.

The company finds itself in a truly historic position and it is an opportunity that isn't going to come around every four years. The confluence of Trump and the increased desire for real-time (and unfiltered) news from around the globe should be a godsend for Twitter, but the company has completely failed to capitalize on the trend.

Taking some of YouTube's best practices might be a good place to start in order to return to relevancy though. It certainly has a better shot of reviving the stock than anything Twitter has come up with recently, and it could push TWTR back towards growth too.

And a position of growth would make Twitter a much better candidate for a takeover, perhaps from a company like Alphabet. Such a partnership makes a lot of sense and it would allow better integration between Google search results and tweets, while the melding of tweets and YouTube comments would be a great match as well.

So, if Twitter wants to get to this end-which seems like the best possible outcome for TWTR investors at this point-take a page out of YouTube's book and start thinking about ways to get more ads out there, and how to benefit creators in the process. Because if Twitter can't take some risks and find a way to make things work when their service is at the forefront of news and popular culture like it is now, they never will.

Since hitting a low near $812 on Feb. 1, GOOGL stock has steadily bounced back, regaining more than 3% of the ground it lost following a poorly received fourth-quarter earnings report.

But you haven’t missed out on the fun. Alphabet stock still has some gas in the tank.



Click to Enlarge Alphabet’s bounce from the $812 region was not happenstance. The shares were bolstered by support from their rising 50-day moving average, and a wealth of psychological support from the nearby $800 area. Furthermore, GOOGL stock has been in rally mode since mid-2015, gaining some 53% during this time frame.

In other words, the post-earnings dip was less about poor quarterly results and more about an excuse to take some profits off the table.

However, now that the situation has corrected itself, and Alphabet stock has emerged from an overbought situation, shares should be poised to run higher.

If you took my bullish GOOGL recommendation on Jan. 31 and got into the March $830/$850 bull call spread, you are likely already at breakeven or sitting on a profit for the trade. What’s more, the odds of breaking out above $850 have improved significantly in the past couple of weeks.

Alternately, if you took the more neutral-to-bullish option and entered the March $800 put sell, you can all but rest easy now that GOOGL stock is headed higher once again.

If you missed out on those trades, though, there’s still time to get in before Alphabet Inc tops out again.

Sentiment for Alphabet remains as bullish as ever, with nearly all of the 48 analysts tracked by Thomson/First Call rating GOOGL stock a “buy.” Additionally, the 12-month price target has risen over the past month to $990.72, and that bodes well for the shares going forward, as it cuts down on the likelihood of downgrades to “hold” over the short-term.

As for options traders, a bit of caution has crept into GOOGL options since Alphabet’s quarterly report, but this, too, is healthy for the shares. Currently, the March put/call open interest ratio rests at 0.76, up from pre-earnings readings near 0.85.

Furthermore, peak March call OI rests well overhead at $900, meaning that Alphabet should see little in the way of potential options-related resistance.

Changes in the way people access the internet are causing some trouble for Mountain View, California-based search engine giant Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), formerly known as Google. People are no longer waiting to reach their home or office to access their desktops. Rather, more and more people are googling on their mobile devices. More searches are happening on mobile than on desktop. This shifting trend represents both an opportunity as well as a challenge for Google. During the latest earnings call, Google's CFO Ruth Porat mentioned mobile as one of the important growth drivers. However, rising mobile search is also impacting Google's margins. In its latest quarterly earnings release, Google’s parent Alphabet reported a miss on its earnings, largely due to the decline in cost per click, which was impacted by the increase in mobile search.

Google mobile ads get more clicks but make less money.

For a while now, mobile search has been growing at a much faster clip than desktop search. According to marketing research firm, eMarketer, in the United States, mobile search volumes surpassed desktop search volumes last year. The rising growth in mobile search has benefitted Google as it has been able to corner a large part of the mobile search business. According to Digital marketing firm Merkle, Google received 96% of all search-ad clicks on mobile devices in the fourth quarter.

Source: eMarketer

However, the problem for Google is that mobile ads fetch lesser money than desktop ads. Cost per click, or the money google makes every time a user clicks an ad continued to fall in the fourth quarter. Google's strategy for mobile has largely been to either figure out new advertising formats, or generate more money from the much larger volume of impressions mobile devices generate. Until now, Google has been able to offset its declining cost-per-click with more impressions to generate impressive results. But Google will need to figure out a way to improve its cost-per-click on mobile.

Google is facing a rising threat from Amazon Inc.

The predominance of mobile is also changing the way people search. People looking to travel are more likely to search on the Priceline or Expedia app, rather than going through Google search. The same is the story with shopping. People who are planning to buy products are more likely to start their search on Amazon, than on Google. According to a report on Business Insider, Amazon is slowly eating into Google's territory by becoming the go-to place for eCommerce search. Around 52% of people start their search for online shopping on Amazon, and only 26% use search engines like Google as the starting point. While Amazon is currently a tiny player in the ad business with its 2016 ad revenues coming in at $1.2 billion, compared to Google's $79 billion, the rise of Amazon's Alexa could be a serious threat to Google.

Yet another trend which is likely to benefit Amazon is the rise in voice searches. With the arrival of personal assistants like Apple's Siri, Google Allo, Amazon's Alexa and Microsoft's Cortana, more people are finding it convenient to use these digital assistants, rather than typing a question into the search bar. Globally, voice-based searches jumped from almost zero to 10% in 2015 and doubled to 20% in 2016. With more people using voice searches, the importance of devices like Amazon's Echo and Google Home is only likely to increase. And currently, Echo is clearly the more popular device. Also, Alexa is finding its way into devices of several other companies like Ford, and even Google's Android ecosystem for that matter. Chinese firm Huawei Technologies, which manufactures android based smartphones announced during CES 2017 that its flagship handset will come with an app which will give its US users access to Alexa. According to Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research, ""To the extent that voice becomes more important and something other than Google’s voice assistant becomes the most popular voice interface on Android phones, that’s a huge loss for Google in terms of data gathering, training its AI (artificial intelligence), and ultimately the ability to drive advertising revenue,""

Alphabet stock is still a good buy.

The shift in search trends are clearly a concern for Google. However, the company is making several efforts to capture more value from mobile ads. Google recently introduced new tools and features to AdWords to specifically address the consumer shift towards mobile, which will allow it to generate more value from mobile ads. In spite of these rising headwinds, Alphabet stock remains a good long-term buy. The average analysts' price target of $990 indicates an 18% upside for GOOGL stock from the current price.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2/13/2017,0.340267119,0.159691067,816,820.96,815.49,819.24,1213324,5.47,3.24,1,"Google Maps is today rolling out a new feature to all users on iOS and Android devices that will allow you to make lists of places that you can star, save and share with friends. There are three different lists types built in at launch – “Favorites,” “Starred Places,” and “Want to Go” – the latter which is designed to serve as a personal bucket list. However, you can also create your own custom lists which can be public, private, or shared with a link.

The feature has been in testing since this past fall among Google’s power users, Google Local Guides, and was built off the starring functionality that’s been available in Google Maps for over five years.

Being able to create and share lists of places could give Google Maps a more social feel to it. That’s an area that Google wants to explore, notes Maps lead product manager, Zach Maier.

Before, he says, Maps has been focused on getting people from point A to point B without getting lost. Now, “we want to help people break out of their routine, and do something new,” he explains.

To use the lists option, you tap the “Save” button that appears on the detail page for the location in question, whether that’s a business – like a restaurant, bar, or shop – or anything else. It can even be a drop pin you place on the map itself, Maier said. That’s helpful for marking specific destinations that aren’t otherwise discoverable in Google Maps, like a particular spot within a large, local park.

It seems like Starred places and Favorites could have some overlap, but the intention with Stars is to allow users to save a personal list of places they need to reference, that aren’t necessarily those they would call “Favorites.” For example, a doctor’s office or school might be Starred, but not favorited.

During testing, users could create lists for themselves, but with today’s launch these can be shared and followed, too.

So if you make a list of the best restaurants in your city, you can make it discoverable by any user on Google Maps by setting the list to public. Or, if you’re making a list to be shared with just one person or a group of friends – like a travel itinerary or local recommendations catering to someone’s particular interests – that list can be shared via a link instead.

Clicking the link will display the list, and with another click you can choose to follow it as well. This will allow you to pull up the list and keep track of its updates at any time, as long as you’re logged into your Google account.

Google hasn’t partnered with any brands or publishers on the launch to seed the service with interesting and useful public lists, but Maier didn’t rule out the possibility in the future. Today, Google already works with several companies, like NYT, USA Today, Michelin, and Google-owned Zagat, for instance, to augment its search results with more information, including links to those brands’ own lists. It would make sense to bring them to Google Maps at some point, too.

The new feature will compete head-on with Foursquare, which has offered list-making tools for some time, as well as with smaller startups like Soon, Spot, and the zillions of other “bucket list” making tools on the App Store.

Google’s public lists won’t yet be searchable, in the same way that Foursquare’s are, but your own lists will pop up as suggestions when you begin to type in the search box. Your lists and those you follow are also available offline.

Google says the new feature is rolling out today on iOS and Android, and lists will be viewable on the web through shared links. The full list-making experience will come to the web and other platforms at a later point.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Early staffers had an unusual compensation system that awarded supersized payouts based on the project's value.

Still, the original program got so costly that a top executive at parent Alphabet Inc. highlighted it last year to explain a jump in expenses. A spokeswoman for Alphabet, the holding company that owns Google and ""Other Bets"" like the autonomous car business, declined to comment.

The payouts contributed to a talent exodus at a time when the company was trying to turn the project into a real business and emerging rivals were recruiting heavily. The episode highlights Alphabet's difficult transition from a digital advertising giant into a diversified technology company with varied groups of employees requiring different incentives. Other new businesses, including health care unit Verily, use different compensation systems too, but they have yet to generate huge payouts like the car project.

The unorthodox system started in 2010, soon after Google unveiled its first self-driving vehicle. It was constructed to tie employees' fortunes to the performance of the project, rather than Google's advertising money machine. In addition to cash salaries, some staffers were given bonuses and equity in the business and these awards were set aside in a special entity. After several years, Google applied a multiplier to the value of the awards and paid some or all of it out. The multiplier was based on periodic valuations of the division, the people said.

The precise metrics that the division was measured by-- and caused the bonuses to balloon-- are not known. But by 2015, the Google car project had come a long way: Google’s vehicles had logged more than one million autonomous miles; car companies including Toyota Motor Corp. and Tesla Inc. announced their own plans to develop autonomous systems; and analysts predicted the technology would transform the auto industry.

A large multiplier was applied to the compensation packages in late 2015, resulting in multi-million dollar payments in some cases, according to the people familiar with the situation. One member of the team had a multiplier of 16 applied to bonuses and equity amassed over four years, one of the people said. They asked not to be identified talking about private matters.



Part of the problem was that payouts snowballed after key milestones were reached, even though the ultimate goal of the project -- fully autonomous vehicles provided to the public through commercial services -- remained years away.

Ruth Porat Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg

It’s unclear how much the payouts cost Alphabet, however, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat talked about it during an earnings conference call with analysts in early 2016.

Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2015 rose 14 percent to $6.6 billion, ""primarily driven by R&D expense, particularly affected by expenses resulting from project milestones in Other Bets established several years ago,"" Porat said, according to a transcript. The CFO wasn’t specific, but one of the people familiar with the situation said the comments referred to the car project compensation.

Staff departures from the car division increased in 2016. Some were frustrated with the pace of progress and had doubts about new leader John Krafcik, while others wanted to start their own autonomous vehicle companies, people familiar with the matter said. The big payouts exacerbated the situation because team members had less financial incentive to stay, the people familiar with the situation said.

Chris Urmson, previous leader of the project, departed in August and is working on a startup. Other early project members left to form Otto, a self-driving trucking company that was quickly snapped up by Uber Technologies Inc. Bryan Salesky, a former Google car executive, started Argo AI, which got a $1 billion investment from Ford Motor Co. on Friday.

Urmson and Salesky didn’t respond to requests for comment. Sebastian Thrun, who started the car project and helped design the pay system, didn’t respond to questions, either.

During the early 2016 conference call, Porat suggested a different approach to incentives at Other Bets in the future. ""It is about getting more ambitious things done. We’re doing that in a framework to ensure we are disciplined with our resources, and this was just calling out a milestone established some time ago,"" she said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data it's what makes the tech world go 'round. And in the case of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ), it's what drives its profits, cash flows and ultimately the value of its stock. Google has made a name for itself delving into people's lives, running it through an algorithm and selling the output to advertisers. Pretty much everything GOOGL stock does - even controlling your thermostat - has to do with creating this huge base of data for the company to play with.

And its latest, and somewhat secret moves are all about getting its hands another massive pile of people's lives. Google is buying floundering social media network Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR ).

Well, not entirely. But GOOGL has started picking off pieces of the Twitter corpse. And by snagging some of TWTR's items now, Alphabet could be setting itself up for to buy the whole enchilada later on. In the end, that actually might be a great deal for GOOGL stock investors as its all about the data.

GOOGL Snags Developer Tools

Twitter has been a potential buyout candidate basically the second it IPO'd a few years ago. Perhaps even more so now that the social network has struggled to see user growth and profitability. TWTR stock has plunged about 60% since its public offering. But like Google, Twitter is much more than just its namesake service. In this case, it's about app development.

For an undisclosed sum, Alphabet has agreed to buyout Twitter's main developer project - Fabric.

Fabric provides a software toolkit for development and design of mobile apps. And even though it's part of Twitter, it's not small potatoes. The software is used by more than 580,000 mobile developers including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NASDAQ: BABA ) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc's (NYSE: WMT ) Jet.com.

Fabric will be folded into Google's own Firebase mobile developer platform, and its employees will be now part of Alphabet.

So why would the company want this stuff and the talent pool? As I said, it's all about data.

With the addition of Fabric, GOOGL will own two of the most popular tools for developing mobile apps. Fabric is a favorite stomping ground for app development for Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iOS software for iPhones/iPads. By having the two under one umbrella, it gives Alphabet an easy inroad to help developers make formerly exclusive iPhone apps available for the mobile web and Google's Android software. You know, where GOOGL stock makes a bulk of its advertising dollars.

The second big data kicker comes from the fact that while much of Google's tools are available for free; many developers will buy computing power and storage from the company's cloud service. It's expected that once Fabric is integrated fully, the deal would be the same. Not only does that boost GOOGL's cloud revenues, but it gives it a chance to comb through all the data being produced and potentially mine it for what it is worth.

Backend as a service (BaaS) platforms like Fabric and Firebase fit perfectly into Google's ""Here, have it for free, we'll just keep the data"" business model.

In the end, the purchase will allow Google to further cement itself as one of the world's biggest mobile app developers and give it a new source of additional revenue.

Alphabet Still Wants Bluebird

But what about Twitter's real function - those juicy 140 character tweets and the social network? Even though Google didn't make an offer to buy the firm, the truth is, Twitter proper still makes for an excellent fit for GOOGL stock. Twitter has a hard time data mining and getting advertisers to embrace all those tweets. But for someone like Google, the social media network - and its 300 million users - is pure gold. Advertisers are starting to prefer social media networks and their ability to drill down to specific users.

The idea behind Twitter selling off this hobby business was so that it could focus on boosting the main product's user base, remove spam/bots and make it a better product. Buy waiting to buy it later, all the hard clean-up work will be done. And if it is still floundering, it gives Alphabet a chance to buy it on the cheap. And considering that there will be now plenty of former Twitter employees at GOOGL, integrating it later on will be a snap.

Bottom Line on GOOGL Stock

While it continues to be a perpetual rumor, Google's latest actions suggest that Twitter will very much be an Alphabet business in the future. The moves to strengthen its one developer base in mobile apps and snag key personal from the social media company is just the first step. It gives plenty of time for Twitter to refocus and reorganize. In the meantime, the additional revenue from Fabric and cloud sales will be certainly welcome.

And when Google finally does buy TWTR, it'll be great news for GOOGL stock. That's 300 million more users it can mine for data and potential extract useful info for advertisers. Google is just one step closer to putting the rumors to rest and snagging the social media company.

Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google Pixel Phone holds a significant advantage over third-party Android smartphones. Since its release, Google Assistant - the new AI powered personal assistant - has been a Pixel Phone exclusive. Third-party smartphones remain stuck with the previous generation Google Now. However, Google released an Android ""alpha"" build late last week and the new Android release enables Google Assistant on third-party smartphones.

Source: Google

GOOGL's third-party Android smartphone partners have been feeling a little betrayed since the release of the Pixel Phone last fall.

Up until then, Google had not been directly competing against them. It developed Android and allowed them to use the operating system on their phones for free - a fair trade off for the hundreds of millions of mobile devices defaulting to revenue-generating Google search. Google did release the Nexus line of smartphones, but they were more of a showcase for Android than an attempt to compete against its partners.

The Pixel Phone's Google Assistant Advantage

The Pixel Phone changed the equation. It was stamped with the Google name for the first time and it was designed to compete head-to-head with the best of the Android smartphones. In another first, a key new Android feature - Google Assistant - was a Pixel Phone exclusive. Google Assistant leverages Alphabet's latest AI technology in a personal digital assistant that goes beyond Google Now, even gaining the ability to participate in two-way conversations.

The situation was serious enough to help convince Android smartphone leader Samsung Electronic Co Ltd (OTCMKTS: SSNLF ) that it needed its own personal assistant. Samsung's Bixby is expected to debut on the Galaxy S8 .

New Android Release Spills the Beans: Google Assistant for All?

Android Police examined a developer ""alpha"" release of Android over the weekend and discovered that GOOGL may be having a change of heart about keeping Google Assistant to itself.

Its team was able to activate and use Google Assistant on several non-Pixel smartphones, including a Samsung Galaxy Note 5 running Android Marshmallow and a Nexus 6P running Android Nougat.

This means that GOOGL is at least experimenting with making Google Assistant available to third-party smartphones in an upcoming new Android release.

Where Would This Leave the Pixel Phone?

While Google's Pixel Phone has premium design and a very nice camera, its primary advantage over third-party smartphones is the exclusive availability of Google Assistant. Take that away and it's more or less competing on a level footing with the big guns from the likes of Samsung. True, the Pixel Phone is guaranteed Android updates, but that's no different than the Nexus phones.

With AI and digital assistants in the spotlight, Google may have decided that having Google Assistant become a standard Android feature is important to maintain its lead over Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhones and Siri.

I wrote a few days ago about Google's struggle against Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) in the smart home . The Amazon Echo and Alexa have taken a huge lead there and Google Assistant on the Google Home speaker and Pixel Phones may not be enough to catch it. If it were to give up its exclusivity and enable Google Assistant on third-party smartphones, GOOGL would suddenly have hundreds of millions of additional devices in play. This would give it far more leverage against Amazon, at the cost of the Pixel Phone competing on a more level playing field.

And the company has always marketed the Pixel Phone as being the ""first phone"" with Google Assistant - not the ""only phone"" - leaving the door open for an eventual general roll-out.

Of course, at this point we aren't certain that GOOGL will pull the trigger. The new Android release in question is alpha software - that's before beta. The company may simply be having some developers test Google Assistant compatibility with third-party hardware with no intention of actually opening up the feature. However, hints like the message ""New! You just got the Google Assistant"" suggest that GOOGL is leaning toward ending Pixel Phone exclusivity and rolling out the AI-powered feature as part of a general Android release.

(RTTNews.com) - Apple Inc.'s ( AAPL ) shares reached their highest closing level ever Monday on optimism the next iPhone will drive a resurgence in sales and help the company's services businesses grow.

The stock rose less than 1 percent to $133.29, topping the prior record of $133 set in February 2015. The increase valued Apple at about $699 billion,. Google parent Alphabet Inc. is next at $573 billion.

The all-time Intraday trading high for Apple shares is $134.54, also reached in 2015. The previous closing record was $133 in February of that year. The stock then dropped for more than a year on concern about waning smartphone industry growth and Apple's prospects beyond the iPhone. However, the company recentlyÂ reported stronger-than-expected iPhone sales during the key holiday quarter, helping the stock reach a new high.

But it doesn't have to be this way. The Internet of Things (IoT) is ushering in a massive wave of technological changes -- nearly 50 billion things will be connected to the IoT by 2020 -- and there are three companies at the forefront of this $7 trillion market that should remain steady, long-term investments: Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) , Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) , and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) .

Verizon Communications

Verizon is stalwart dividend stock that has plenty of long-term potential in the IoT. The company already dominates the wireless network space despite cutthroat competition from AT&T and T-Mobile , and it's only getting stronger.

Verizon is making early investments in 5G networks that should give the company an edge over its competitors in the IoT network space, much like the company's early push into 4G kept it ahead of the competition. Verizon calls 5G the ""foundation for creating more internet-connected devices"" and says that it will use the network to bring traffic lights, stop signs, parking meters, and other city systems online.

Over the next few months, the company plans on rolling out commercial 5G field tests in a few locations. Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam said at an investor conference in December that he believes the company is two to three years ahead of the competition for 5G because of its early tests and the company's recent purchase of the fiber-optic network company XO Communications.

5G will allow new types of faster-than-ever device connections, and Verizon's early mover advantage could pay off down the road.

Cisco Systems

Cisco is a perfect example of a company that will plug away in its respective field without offering investors much drama -- and at the same time provide a nice 3.3% dividend yield to boot.

Cisco has been talking about the IoT for quite some time, but one of biggest moves came early last year when the company announced it was buying Jasper Technologies for $1.4 billion.

Jasper is a cloud-based IoT service platform that allows enterprise and service customers to ""launch, manage and monetize IoT services on a global scale."" In short, Jasper allows companies to bring nearly any device online (think cars or jet engines) and then manage those connections through its proprietary software.

Jasper brings with it 3,500 enterprise customers from around the world that have devices running on 27 service providers. And Cisco said that it will be able to add to Jasper's services with its own enterprise Wi-Fi, IoT security solutions, and advanced analytics.

With Jasper, Cisco transitions further into the the software-as-a-service (SaaS) market that brings recurring revenue, and allows the company to rely a little less on the traditionally cyclical hardware market.

Alphabet

Alphabet and its subsidiaries have been extremely aggressive in the IoT space, and given the company's massive market size and its quarterly revenues north of $26 billion, this is certainly a company investors don't need to babysit.

Most of Alphabet's IoT opportunities stem from Google, which is already a leader in the connected home space with Google Home and Nest Labs. By having a slew of IoT devices for the home, along with an embedded smart assistant in Google Home, the company is helping to lead the way in IoT home connections.

But one of Alphabet's biggest IoT pushes right now comes from a company called Waymo, which was recently spun out of Google . Waymo is the product of years of research and real-world testing of self-driving cars and Google is looking to the company to now stand on its own and start generating revenue.

Waymo has partnered with Fiat Chrysler to bring 100 self-driving minivans to to the roadways to begin testing an autonomous driving service. The company is likely still years away from bringing in any significant revenue for Google, but it's clear that under Alphabet's umbrella self-driving tech is a big part of the company's IoT plans.

On top of that, other companies under Alphabet are exploring IoT possibilities, like using nanoparticles to find diseases in the bloodstream, by pairing them to wearable tech devices.

Whatever you do, just don't miss this opportunity

Investors looking for steady companies shouldn't overlook the massive opportunities that the IoT has to offer . Nearly 50 billion things will be connecting the internet in just a few years and the IoT market has the potential to transform many aspects of our lives. The three stocks above are all big tech names that are tapping into the IoT's potential in their own way, offering investors growth opportunities on top of stable existing businesses.

On Friday, RBC Capital hosted a conference call with Research Director Luke Bujarski, Senior Research Analyst Jared Wein, and Skift Executive Editor Dennis Schaal to discuss Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) impact on the travel industry.

According to Skift, Google Flights is gaining momentum and continues to see traction. Of note, Skift believes Google Flights is being particularly aggressive in the U.S. and appears to be gaining share from competitors. To put some context around this, according to Google Trends data, the term “Google Flights” in the U.S. rose 22-pts in January, compared with a 12-pt increase for “Kayak,” “Skyscanner” and “Momondo” combined. On the other hand, Google Hotel Ads, which is essentially Google’s metasearch platform, is underperforming relative to Google Flights.

“Skift estimates Google owns up to 90% of the digital travel advertising market, translating into ~$12B of revenue in 2016 with the major OTA’s accounting for roughly half of that revenue. Among the OTA’s, Priceline pays Google the most, which Skift’s estimates is ~50% more than Expedia and >5x as much a TripAdvisor. Overall, Skift expects digital travel ad spend to grow 20% annually and believes the OTA’s will continue to hold the same share. That said, the OTA’s are likely to continue experimenting with other channels but these remain largely experimental and aspirational,” the RBC team noted.

RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney currently rates GOOGL at Buy, with a price target of $1025, which represents a potential upside of 23% from where the stock is currently trading.

According to TipRanks.com, which measures analysts’ and bloggers’ success rate based on how their calls perform, analyst Mark Mahaney has a yearly average return of 21.4% and a 72% success rate. Mahaney has a 15.4% average return when recommending GOOGL, and is ranked #4 out of 4428 analysts.

Out of the 29 analysts polled in the past 12 months, 27 rate Alphabet stock a Buy, 1 rates the stock a Hold and 1 recommends to Sell. With a return potential of nearly 18%, the stock’s consensus target price stands at $989.14.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have bought a few shares in 2015, when the price was around the $550 level, but it always remained a small position in my stock portfolio. The reason why I did this was because I considered the stock price elevated from a technical point of view. The price has been growing strongly almost continuously in the previous years without much of a pullback. As a consequence, this company remained on the watchlist of stocks I would buy if the markets crashed (like in 2008-2009).

That's not to say I don't believe in the company fundamentally. I use Google daily (everyone I know does), and the companies I worked for are all advertising via the Google website. I strongly believe Google will keep growing its income flow from advertising and will keep increasing its market value. While Alphabet is more than just Google (the advertising business), the strong income from this segment is, for me, the most important reason buy this stock and hold it in my portfolio for many years.

In the beginning of 2017, I forced myself to take a closer look into the fundamentals of Alphabet, its earnings growth and what can likely be expected in the future from this company and its stock price. I will present a short summary of these results in this article and demonstrate a trade idea to benefit from Google and its future price performance.

Fundamentals of Alphabet

The revenue of Alphabet is currently $90 billion for 2016 (up from $0.4 billion in 2002). Growth in revenues has been realized year after year:

(Source: Statista)

The bulk of this revenue comes from the advertising business of Alphabet Inc. A question worth asking here is: Will the growth of the advertising business in general continue as well in the coming years?

A recent report from the Internet Advertising Bureau details the quarterly growth in the advertising income since 1996. As can be seen from this chart, income from advertising is still growing strongly. Internet ad revenues increased by 20% in Q3 2016 (year over year).

(Source: Interactive Advertising Bureau)

Being the most dominant player in the online search market, Google has seen its income increase steadily. We should also keep in mind the other business fields Alphabet is active in, outside of advertising. The company calls this segment ""Other Bets"". While income from this segment is small in comparison to that from the advertising segment, it could become more significant in the future. Shareholders of Alphabet will benefit from successes in this segment as well once the income starts to increase.

In the table below, Alphabet's fundamentals for the previous years are summarized. I expect these growth rates to continue in the coming years, just as they have been doing since the inception. The stock price of Alphabet is bound to appreciate further with these underlying fundamentals.

Opportunity: Buy long-term call option on Alphabet

Considering these points above, we think Alphabet remains a strong investment in 2017 and in the upcoming years. The current P/E ratio of the stock price is 30, which seems reasonable given its current position.

For this reason, we would suggest initiating a long position in a call option contract on Alphabet. In this way, you can minimize your required investment to benefit from a rise in the underlying stock price. Here we would suggest buying a call option contract expiring on January 19, 2018, with a strike price of $900 (around 8% above the current stock price).

(Source: Nasdaq.com)

This call option contract gives the holder the right to buy 100 shares of Alphabet for $900 at any time until 19/01/2018. The total cost of the call option contract will be $4,169 ($41.69 per common share).

The trade has the following benefits:

The implied volatility of Alphabet is currently low (13%), considering the implied volatility levels it faced in the past. This implied volatility is the main driver of option prices on Alphabet, which means the options are inexpensive at these IV levels. This low volatility can also be seen in the general stock indices, which are currently making new highs.

(Source: Optionistics)

The profit potential is highly leveraged compared to a simple purchase of Alphabet common stocks. In the graph below, we compare the profit profile of the call options with the profit profile of common GOOGL stocks:

(Source: Yahoo Finance)

The expiration of the call options is on 19th January, 2018, giving the stock price of Alphabet time to increase in value.

The risk of this option investment is limited to the debit amount paid for the call options. A purchase of 100 GOOGL stocks would currently cost $83,400. This call option contract only costs $4,169 and will also give you upward potential from appreciation in the stock price of GOOGL.

The main disadvantage of this call option investment (compared to an investment in the common stock) is the timing. If the common stock declines in the upcoming months, the premium of the GOOGL calls will decline strongly as well. With GOOGL stocks, you can just hold on to your stock and wait for better times, while you don't have this luxury with the call options.

In conclusion

GOOGL has seen its stock price rise strongly in the previous years, systematically beating the S&P 500 stock index. This can be explained by the company's strong fundamentals and its growing revenue from the advertising market. We expect this outperformance to continue in the future with a rising GOOGL stock price.

Investors who believe in GOOGL can buy common stock at $834 or purchase call options. We prefer the latter alternative, mainly because the implied volatility is this low. Call options are not expensive at these anticipated volatility levels, and investors can use this fact to make an investment in Alphabet Inc.

Disclosure: I am/we are long GOOGL.

I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2/10/2017,0.540009087,0.131974913,811.7,815.25,809.78,813.67,1134976,5.47,1.97,1,"Google's Pixel was something of a surprise. A phone which, while aesthetically boring, won over users for its complication-free version of Android, a nifty Artificial Assistant and a camera that, in spite of being technically dreadful - the lens doesn't let in anywhere near as much light as its rivals - was able to create the best photos of any smartphone, especially in low light, where it should be terrible.

But let's look at how Google managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory with its flagship phones.

1) Stock levels are a joke

The Pixel XL is back in stock in the US finally on Google's store, well, not all the different models, but some of them are. Some might argue that out-of-stock means Google is selling lots of phones. Perhaps, but it might be all sorts of other things too.

But this just doesn't feel right. The phone isn't new anymore, so either Google is throttling supply to make it look popular or it has supply chain problems that it can't resolve. It's not a surprise that Apple wins nods from those in the know about keeping the iPhone in stock, in spite of massive demand from the public.

Add to this the fact that Google doesn't allow backorders on out-of-stock handsets and things get even more absurd. For me this refusal suggests that there is something else going on with the production of these phones which perhaps makes production hard to predict.

Take a look at NowInStock.net and you'll see what phones are current in and out of stock. Of the 10 different variants, eight are currently showing as out-of-stock. You can still order some of the handsets on a 4-5 week wait. Incidentally, if you're trying to get a phone NowInStock can email you when it appears to be available - so there's some hope for would-be owners.

2) You paid for a phone so Google can sell you to advertisers

Some people just won't agree with me on this point, but Google makes a lot of money out of selling you to advertisers. Now I'm not making this point on privacy grounds at all, because that data is - as far as we know - anonymised, but does it bother no one else that a phone that costs as much as an iPhone is also using you to make more money for Google?

You could level this at all Android phones, but for the most part these devices only run Android, rather than profiting from it. In Google's case though, this expensive phone is raking in even more money for the company.

Oracle says that Google has made over $30bn from Android. Now, that figure might be somewhat wide of the mark in terms of accuracy, but Android is very popular and has a massive install base, it doesn't feel that ridiculous.

But this article isn't so much about what I find objectionable, it's about how Google hasn't managed to really make the best of the Pixel, and here I feel this point is important. The Phone is too expensive, dropping the price would be a good way to sell more units and Google could almost certainly afford to cut the price a bit and still make a profit both on hardware sales, and services revenue.

3) Poor service provider options

If Google wanted to sell as many phones as possible it would not have restricted the availability of the handset by doing an exclusive carrier deal with Verizon. People don't usually want to buy a phone upfront, for cash. They want to pay monthly for their phone and have that amount hidden away in a cellular contract.

So Google selling the Pixel on its website is a niche interest. Some people love it, obviously, but it doesn't factor in the mind of ""normal"" people. They want a service provider to sell them a phone, and the only company doing that is Verizon. Not everyone in the US is on Verizon. That really limits your audience.

Of course carrier exclusivity worked for Apple when it launched the iPhone, but that was 10 years ago and everything has changed. Apple wouldn't do a restrictive deal on one network now, it just doesn't make sense. The public understands mobile devices and doesn't need hand-holding. What people need and want is their provider to offer the phone, and if it doesn't then they won't switch to get it.

4) Squandered the Note 7 explosion scandal

Samsung had phones exploding left, right and centre. Google could have really pushed into that market of people who had been starved of their large-format devices. Although some of the things that people love about the Note aren't on the Pixel (S Pen and removable storage, along with water resistance) it would still make for a good alternative device if you didn't want to switch to a Samsung Galaxy S7.

Samsung had sold about 2.5 million Note 7 handsets before cancelling the line. Google was predicted to have sold between 3 and 5 million Pixels in the last quarter of 2016. It's not a leap to say that Samsung would have sold a lot more devices in the same timeframe, had tragedy not struck.

So again, my point is that Google had a largely open market here. I can't speak for the US, but London, where I live, is drenched in adverts for Google's phone. Why isn't it selling more - I think it's back to that exclusivity issue again.

Conclusion

So here's my point. Everyone who has reviewed the Pixel says it's a great phone. The camera is great, the phone works well and it's got enough features to separate it from the mass of other Android devices out there. Google's decision to keep the AI exclusive to the Pixel was a good idea because it gives an additional feature that makes the phone special.

A lot of things about the Pixel don't make sense to me, but Google doesn't release sales figures and doesn't answer questions about how handsets are performing. None of that changes the fact that Google has confounded me with the Pixel launch - this was going to be a big deal, but Google isn't much closer to owning the Android space than it was a year ago.

Perhaps Google's objectives are different? Maybe this year's devices will help explain where the company is going. Until then, feel free to buy a Pixel, it seems like it deserves a lot more success than it's getting.

(RTTNews.com) - Netflix Inc. ( NFLX ) recently released the first trailer for ""Dear White People,"" an upcoming comedy series based on director Justin Simien's critically-acclaimed, Sundance award-winning satirical indie film of the same name.

The 10-episode, 30-minute series premieres on April 28, 2017. It satirizes ""post-racial"" America and focuses on underlying racism in American universities. It tells about the experience of a group of ethnically diverse students at a prestigious, majority white Ivy League college.

But the trailer received a backlash with Twitter users accusing Netflix of ""glorifying Anti-White racism"" and calling for a boycott of the streaming service using the hashtag ""#BoycottNetflix."" On YouTube, the trailer had a huge number of downvotes, compared to a small number of upvotes.

""I think what pisses people off is seeing a woman of color refer to white people en masse. Something she'd not dare be allowed in decades past,"" Simien added.

Netflix has described the series in a press release and said, ""Through an absurdist lens, Dear White People utilizes biting irony, self-deprecation and sometimes brutal honesty to hold up a mirror to the issues plaguing society today, all the while leading with laughter.""

The original film first gained traction in 2012 with a concept trailer. By 2014, the crowd funded movie made a splash at film festivals, earning the U.S. Dramatic Special Jury Award for Breakthrough Talent at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival. However, the film received no backlash at that time.

In May 2016, Netflix had said it will stream a comedy series based on the film, with the series to be produced by Lionsgate. At that time too, there was no adverse reaction from people.

A report began circulating several days ago that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) may start production of the iPhone 8 early. Typically, when a company starts manufacturing sooner than usual, that points to an accelerated release date for a new product.

Source: Apple

In this case, it seems unlikely the move will result in an iPhone release date before Apple's standard September launch.

If not to get it on shelves sooner, why would the company want to get an early start on new iPhone production?

The iPhone 8 Early Production Ramp Up

Apple has a pretty standard roadmap when it comes to new iPhone releases. With a late September iPhone release date, the company starts to ramp up production of the new model in late summer. However, this year it looks as though Apple may be breaking with tradition.

According to a report from BlueFin Research Partners, there are indicators in the company's supply chain that point to an unusually early production ramp up for the iPhone 8. Quoted in MSN Money , the BlueFin report notes :

""The most intriguing data points that we have uncovered suggests that Apple is ramping the next generation iPhones earlier than historical norms.""

Why Early Production Won't Lead to an Earlier iPhone Release Date

Before anyone gets too excited about the possibility of an early iPhone 8 release, that scenario is highly unlikely.

First, ramping up production in June means Apple will begin having stock of the new iPhones in warehouses by the summer. But no one releases a flagship smartphone during the summer months - that's a slow time for consumer technology news. People are on vacation and not only would an iPhone announcement not get the coverage Apple expects for its new product launches, with so many people away the line-ups at Apple Stores the company is hoping for wouldn't happen.

An early release would also reduce iPhone 7 sales. Now that production is humming on that model, Apple wouldn't want to kneecap it by releasing the iPhone 8 early.

So Why Would Apple Ramp up iPhone 8 Production Early?

It's become increasingly obvious that companies like Apple are pushing the limits of their supply chain and manufacturing partners with their latest smartphones. The new dual camera system, haptic Home button and other components led to a shortage of some iPhone 7 models at launch. Apple ramped up production in late summer as usual, but these issues caused delays .

I preordered an iPhone 7 Plus, but still waited a month after the new iPhones went on sale before mine was available …

Then there's the issue of batteries. Apple has had to face its own headaches with iPhone 6 and 6s batteries , but those problems pale in comparison to the nightmare rival Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (OTCMKTS: SSNLF ) has gone through with the Galaxy Note 7 and its exploding batteries.

There's a lot riding on the iPhone 8 and Apple appears to be throwing all sorts of new features, cutting-edge technology and a completely new design at its 10th anniversary iPhone. Glass construction, wireless charging, an OLED display, virtual Home button and more. The company is even rumored to be charging $1,000-plus for its new flagship, an unprecedented price for a smartphone.

In addition, Samsung will likely be introducing its new Galaxy Note around the same time, and pulling out all the stops to make that phablet such a smash hit that everyone forgets about the Galaxy Note 7. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is also expected to release the followup to the worryingly successful Google Pixel Phone in the fall.

Rather than ramping up for an early launch, it's far more likely that Apple is starting iPhone 8 production early in order to iron out all the manufacturing bugs early. Virtually all of the components will be new and Apple will undoubtedly be pushing the limits of manufacturing capability. Having an early start will ensure any issues are caught well before the iPhone 8 goes on sale, ensuring a smooth, scandal-free, launch. And no embarrassing issues for the competition to take advantage of.

The early ramp up also ensures that even if things don't go smoothly at first, there will be plenty of iPhone 8 smartphones sitting in Apple warehouses in September, ensuring a record-setting launch.

Despite the apparent early production ramp up, don't expect an iPhone release date in the summer. But Apple's move does mean you should have a flawless iPhone 8 in your hands at the launch, instead of waiting weeks or months for supply to catch up to demand.

As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

It appears the only thing now strong enough to stop Nvidia (NVDA) stock from climbing higher are investors’ expectations. Thanks to the company’s advancements in cutting-edge technologies such as deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI), NVDA shares have soared some 340% over the past year, crushing every important index.

As such, the California-based semiconductor giant had lot to prove Thursday. And with top- and bottom-line numbers that cruised by even the most bullish forecasts, Nvidia answered the call. But the shares appear muted, falling as much as 3% in the after-hour session. From my vantage point, this decline, which I consider inconsequential, is victory for Nvidia and its investors. I’ll get back to that in a moment.

Let’s go though the numbers.

In the three months that ended December, Nvidia reported net a income of $655 million, or 99 cents per share. On an adjusted basis, when taking out one-time gains and costs, earnings came to $1.30 per share, which beat consensus estimates by a whopping 30 cents. Fourth quarter revenue also beat, coming in 55% higher year over year to $2.17 billion. The Street was looking for revenue of $2.11 billion.

The strong bottom-line beat was driven by record quarterly GAAP gross margin at 60.0%, the company said, while non-GAAP gross margin at 60.2%. When looking back at fiscal 2016, the company broke several of its own records, including full-year revenue of $6.91 billion, which grew 38% from a year ago.

""We had a great finish to a record year, with continued strong growth across all our businesses,"" said CEO Jen-Hsun Huang in a statement. ""Our GPU computing platform is enjoying rapid adoption in artificial intelligence, cloud computing, gaming, and autonomous vehicles. Huang also added that Nvidia’s deep learning GPUs (graphical processing units) has made a breakthrough approach to AI, which can now help in early cancer detection, weather prediction and is helping to tackle challenges such as self-driving cars.

All told, it is these breakthrough areas that continue to drive interest in NVDA stock. Admittedly, I wasn’t a believer until now. And while the tech battle has always been between Apple (AAPL) Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB), those guys are not alone anymore.

In terms of the 3% decline on these solid numbers? Nvidia is being shown the respect it now deserves. Even if the stock were to decline 5% to 10% — after a 340% one-year rise — it would still imply the momentum story is still in place. And Nvidia’s Q1 outlook for revenue to be $1.9 billion, which surpass Wall Street estimates of $1.88 billion, suggests it sees no signs of slowing down.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google Home connected speaker takes on Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Alexa on its home turf. But what about Google's big advantage over Amazon in the smart home war - all those smartphones?

Source: Google

The company has just begun rolling out Home Control, a new feature that lets Google Assistant control smart home devices by voice.

However, at this point, Home Control - like Google Assistant - remains a feature that's exclusive to Google's own Pixel Phones.

The Battle for the Smart Home

Google Home is a connected speaker with Google Assistant baked in. Owners can use Google Assistant on the speaker to answer questions, find music and control a growing number of smart home devices using their voice only.

The device is GOOGL's answer to the Amazon Echo. Amazon's Alexa-enabled speaker has been a surprise hit and allowed Amazon to take a big lead in the race to become the smart home hub - despite the distinct disadvantage of lacking a smartphone platform to host its digital assistant.

Google has Google Now and the new Google Assistant, while Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has Siri. Between them, the two companies have billions of mobile devices in consumers' hands, yet Amazon still managed to leapfrog them with its personal assistant hosted in a speaker, to build an impressive smart home lead.

Apple's Siri can control HomeKit-compatible smart home devices using voice commands, and now GOOGL is rolling out a similar feature for its Google Assistant, Home Control .

Home Control

Google's new feature for voice control of smart devices isn't actually new. Anyone who owns both a Pixel Phone and a Google Home speaker already had a Home Control setting on their smartphone.

However, as of yesterday, GOOGL has begun to roll out Home Control to all Google Assistant users. This amounts to all Pixel Phone owners, since Google Assistant remains an exclusive that third-party Android smartphones don't get.

With Home Control, someone with a Pixel Phone gets the same voice control ability for smart devices they would have if they owned a Google Home speaker. They can use voice commands on their phone to change the temperature on their Nest Learning Thermostat or turn off the smart lighting in the room they just left.

The Battle for the Smart Home Enters a New Phase (Sort of)

At the start of this fight to be the company that becomes the hub of the smart home - the one who controls all those smart devices - the smartphone was it.

Smartphones ran all the apps that controlled each of the devices and everyone owned one. With smartphones, the battle came down to iOS and Android, Apple and Google.

Then Amazon disrupted everything with the Echo and Alexa. With thousands of compatible products and services, consumers have been snapping them up. Amazon sold out of the Echo at Christmas, after selling nine times more of the smart speaker than the previous year.

Voice control is in. Having to poke buttons on a smartphone is out.

However, Apple and Google are not about to cede the smart home to Amazon. GOOGL began its assault on Amazon with the Google Home smart speaker to directly take on the Echo and Alexa. With Home Control, it's bringing voice control of smart devices to the smartphone, leveraging its massive lead over Amazon when it comes to numbers. There may be millions of Alexa-powered homes, but there are billions of people already carrying an Android smartphone.

Except, most of those people still won't be able to use Home Control. GOOGL has baked Home Control into Google Assistant, a feature that's been exclusive to its Pixel Phones since they were released last fall. With Google Home and now Home Control, Alphabet clearly has Amazon's number. The question will be whether Amazon gets Alexa into more third-party devices before Google decides to let third-party Android smartphone makers have access to Google Assistant.

For GOOGL, the decision comes down to which is more valuable: maintaining a key competitive advantage for its own Pixel Phones, or giving up that Google Assistant and Home Control exclusivity to take a real shot at unseating Amazon in the smart home.

It's no secret that Nvidia (NVDA) was the best performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2016, gaining more than 370%. But while the company's graphics processor unit (GPU) chips are being used in everything from gaming PCs to autonomous cars to virtual reality to data centers, the reinvigoration of Nvidia is built by one thing: artificial intelligence.

AI is increasingly being used in everything and everywhere, most notably data centers for machine learning, where Nvidia's GPUs have a tremendous lead over the competition, including anything from AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC). Data center revenue was up 67% year-over-year in the quarter at $296 million and more impressive, up 23% from the impressive fiscal third-quarter 2017 results that helped send the stock soaring more than 30% in November 2016.

The technology is touching everything and anyone, be it on your smartphone or when you shop on Amazon (AMZN) or using software. In fact, Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang told Barron's that AI is just the future of software.

If you read Nvidia's conference call transcript and its earnings press release, AI is mentioned everywhere and with good reason: deep learning is only made possible by the advancements in AI being made by university researchers and big companies such as Google (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Amazon and others.

In reacting to the blow-out earnings results, Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis called Nvidia essentially the only publicly traded company solely focused on AI. ""[Nvidia] posted its 7th consecutive beat, and while YoY rev growth of 55% likely marks 2nd derivative peak, the 200% growth in its Datacenter business and improving GM reinforce our thesis that NVDA is emerging as the de facto standard in AI - one of the most exciting growth drivers in tech,"" Lipacis wrote, while raising his price target to $140 from $125.

Of the aforementioned areas, perhaps the one that is most tangible to show consumers the AI revolution is autonomous driving.

Tesla (TSLA) and CEO Elon Musk have pioneered autonomous driving in the Model S (though to which extent is up for debate), but Tesla has chosen to use Nvidia's chipsets to not only help it with its infotainment unit, but more importantly, the software that helps with autonomy, using the NVIDIA DRIVE™ PX 2 AI computing platform.

Society is a little bit away from true autonomy in a car (Level 5), in which a human does not need to do anything, but Tesla is working on getting towards Level 4/5 faster than anyone else, thanks to Nvidia. (For a good primer on what each level means, click here.)

Nvidia has several other automotive partnerships, including recently announced ones with Bosch and Audi.

All of this highlights that self-driving cars is not just a science fiction fantasy, it's real and it's coming. And it's being powered by AI. The societal impact AI will have is up for debate, whether it will be a net positive or a net negative, but there is no stopping it.

AI is continuing to become more prevalent in everything we do, but we are nowhere near general AI, in which computers can make decisions just as a human can. What we're experiencing right now is soft (weak) AI, in which humans tell a computer to do a task and it does it better than any human can. But thanks to deep/machine learning, we're getting closer to general AI, even if it's still decades away. That means the AI revolution is only just getting started and it has years and years on which to run.

All thanks to Nvidia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Under a month ago, I wrote about how it wasn't too late to create free profits from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) stock. The trade yielded almost $5 in pure profits. I gained $3 from my debit call spread appreciation and $2 from selling the naked put.

Now Apple stock sits near its all-time highs making it difficult to recommend an entry point. Furthermore, other mega-caps like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) or Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG ,NASDAQ: GOOGL ) have more obvious entry points.

So is it too late to set another long trade in AAPL? I don't think so; there is still time to set another trade using options for another potential run of free profits.

Fundamentally, Apple stock still is a money printing machine with a rosy intermediate outlook. I have my concerns about its leadership though; I strongly believe that Tim Cook will ruin Apple, but not in the next few months. Meanwhile, and if markets in general don't suffer a sustained correction this year, AAPL should be higher through 2017.



Click to Enlarge Technically, AAPL has a few constructive points. First, it made a wide rounding bottom rejecting the last swoon.

Also, I think that if Apple stock sets a new high it would invite more frantic buyers who were leery of the potential of another double top.

The Trade: Buy the AAPL April debit $135/$140 call spread. This is a bullish trade for which I pay $1.40 per contract to open. If Apple rallies well past my spread, I stand to triple my money. The price I pay to open the trade is the maximum I could lose. Usually I like to lower my exposure. In this case, I want to sell downside risk premium to finance the purchase of my calls or more. It's difficult to do so near all-time-high levels, but not impossible.

The Bank: Sell the AAPL Jan 2018 $105 put. This also is a bullish trade for which I collect $3 per contract to open. By selling naked puts I am committing to buying the stock at the strike sold if Apple stock falls below it. But even if that bad scenario unfolds, I would have bought the stock at a 20% discount from today's levels. This trade has a 90% theoretical chance of success.

As long as AAPL stock stays above my put sold, any premium I collect from selling my debit call spread can be pure profit. So if price action becomes too bearish, I could sell back the debit call spread for a profit even if the price I get is lower than my entry price.

I am not required to hold my trades through their expiration dates. I can close either at any time for partial gains or losses.

It has been a good, but volatile, ride for Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) shareholders in 2017. Now supports are once again firming up both off and on the price chart for GOOGL stock. And for shorter-term investors, a bullishly targeted butterfly is one way to position and capture a nice profit range with limited risk in lieu of owning shares of Alphabet.

When it comes to large-cap tech outfits like Alphabet, political risks ranging from China to net neutrality to immigration laws remain a question mark. But waiting on a resolution is like waiting on Godot.

It may take a while. As well, those eventual outcomes could always prove beneficial to GOOGL.

Of course, there are also the potential political supports, such as cash repatriation and favorable corporate tax cuts, to consider. Not only is passage of such legislation more popular and likely easier to push through Congress, it would certainly be a boon for Alphabet.

What's more, GOOGL stock is looking great again after its recent earnings report. Bottom line, earnings missed but growth is back. With its Q4 results, Alphabet proved its business focuses outside the company's bread-and-butter advertising search revenues, are starting to pay-off for the company.

For one, mobile search and YouTube both showed strong results and helped with Alphabet's overall ""exceptional"" year-over-year sales growth of 24%.

But newer investments are also coming into their own. The company's aggressive shift into hardware such as its Pixel smartphone, AI-enhanced Home and virtual reality helped Alphabet grow its ""other revenues"" by more than 62% on sales of $3.4 billion.

GOOGL Stock Daily Chart

Away from Alphabet's overall bullish narrative off the price chart, GOOGL stock is showing technical support for a long stake by investors.

Following a fairly stiff post-earnings bout of profit-taking from brief all-time-highs, Alphabet has managed to find support from a Fibonacci zone, key price pivot dating back to last February's high, as well as the intermediate-term, 50-day simple moving average.

Looking forward, targeting the post-earnings high of $867 appears logical. At roughly 4% from current prices, but with no overt company-specific catalysts on the immediate horizon to push GOOGL shares aggressively higher, I like the idea of using a targeted long butterfly spread.

GOOGL Stock Bullish Call Butterfly Spread

Timing is everything. This is especially true with options strategies as calls and puts are wasting assets. Our last discussion on Alphabet options is intimately aware of this, as a lower-risk, bullishly placed long butterfly literally expired one day and $1 dollar short of cleaning up.

I suppose you could say the last trade got trumped.

Nevertheless, in looking at Alphabet's options and given what has been addressed, the GOOGL March $845/$860/$875 is attractive.

With GOOGL trading at $833, the out-of-the-money and bullishly placed butterfly is priced for $2.20 per spread, or less than one-third of one percent of the GOOGL stock price. A maximum profit of $12.80 or return approaching 600% would occur if GOOGL rallied by 3.25% over the next month and landed on the sold center strike $860 call at expiration.

The desired and very precise outcome for maximizing returns is not a high-probability event by any stretch. However, with its limited risk, profit range from roughly $847 to $873 and maybe the use of a 50% stop loss in the event profit-taking turns into something more ominous, a GOOGL stock butterfly looks well positioned for the situation.

2/10/2017,0.442476361,0.20898539,811.7,815.25,809.78,813.67,1134976,5.47,1.97,1,"Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) announced on Friday that it is acquiring a majority stake in artificial-intelligence start-up Argo AI for $1 billion, to be paid over five years.

What is Argo AI?

Argo AI is a new company, founded late last year by CEO Bryan Salesky and COO Peter Rander. Both are big names in self-driving circles: Salesky was the head of hardware at Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Waymo unit (formerly known as the Google Self-Driving Car Project); Rander was a top engineer in Uber Technologies' autonomous-vehicle division. Both were previously at the robotics institute at Carnegie Mellon University, where they worked on artificial-intelligence (AI) technology.

The plan for Argo AI is to use the founders' expertise in AI to develop autonomous-vehicle software. The company is headquartered in Pittsburgh. It's small now, but it expects to have more than 200 employees by the end of 2017.

What Ford said about the deal

Ford said that Argo AI ""is bringing together some of the most experienced roboticists and engineers working in autonomy from inside and outside of Ford."" An existing Ford team that has been working on what Ford calls its ""virtual driver system,"" the brain of an autonomous vehicle, will become part of Argo AI.

While Ford will continue to develop its self-driving hardware in-house, it appears that Argo AI will be responsible for much of the software development. That software could be licensed to other companies, CEO Mark Fields said, and it's possible that Argo AI will go public at some point.

""The next decade will be defined by the automation of the automobile, and autonomous vehicles will have as significant an impact on society as Ford's moving assembly line did 100 years ago,"" Fields said. ""As Ford expands to be an auto and a mobility company, we believe that investing in Argo AI will create significant value for our shareholders by strengthening Ford's leadership in bringing self-driving vehicles to market in the near term and by creating technology that could be licensed to others in the future.""

Ford will hold a majority stake in the new company. Fields wouldn't say exactly what Ford's ownership percentage will be, but he did say that it was gauged to leave plenty of room to provide equity compensation to new employees.

Ford's global product chief and CTO, Raj Nair, and group vice president of global strategy, John Casesa, will hold two of the five seats on Argo AI's board. Salesky and Rander will hold two more, and the fifth will go to an independent director to be named later.

Investors, take note: Fields said that Argo AI's spending and results will be consolidated into Ford's automotive financial results, primarily in the North America region.

What this deal is really about

Here's how I'm thinking about this deal: Ford just hired two rock stars in AI and autonomous vehicles, put them in charge of its self-driving software team, and structured the whole thing to give the team members -- and very importantly, future hires, in a field in which the competition for talent is fierce -- the upside of a start-up with lower risk, because Ford's investment has essentially capitalized the company and Ford will be its first customer. It's an intriguing idea; it could turn out to be a brilliant one.

During a conference call for analysts and media, Salesky emphasized that the structure of what he called the ""collaboration"" between Argo AI and Ford would help recruiting: New hires (and Ford's existing virtual-driver team) will go to work for a start-up with significant potential upside, not (directly, at least) for giant Ford.

And while it's a start-up, Ford's involvement means that new hires can be assured that Argo AI has both solid funding and a major customer. The combination of relatively low risk with high potential upside should make for a potent recruiting tool in a field where the competition for talent has been extremely fierce.

The upshot: An intriguing move to boost Ford's technology push

For Ford, this is a way to bring some deep AI expertise into its self-driving development project, structured in a way that will help boost its recruiting efforts going forward. Nair said that he doesn't expect the deal to ""accelerate"" Ford's effort -- he stuck by the previously announced 2021 deadline for Ford's first mass-produced self-driving vehicle.

But there's a clear advantage to putting the team under the leadership of Salesky and Rander, in a company that offers the upside of a start-up with less risk than most. We'll have to wait to learn more about the structure of the deal to evaluate it fully, but right now it looks like Ford has taken an intriguing step ahead.

But what about Google’s big advantage over Amazon in the smart home war — all those smartphones?

Source: Google

The company has just begun rolling out Home Control, a new feature that lets Google Assistant control smart home devices by voice.

However, at this point, Home Control — like Google Assistant — remains a feature that’s exclusive to Google’s own Pixel Phones.

The Battle for the Smart Home

Google Home is a connected speaker with Google Assistant baked in. Owners can use Google Assistant on the speaker to answer questions, find music and control a growing number of smart home devices using their voice only.

The device is GOOGL’s answer to the Amazon Echo. Amazon’s Alexa-enabled speaker has been a surprise hit and allowed Amazon to take a big lead in the race to become the smart home hub — despite the distinct disadvantage of lacking a smartphone platform to host its digital assistant.

Google has Google Now and the new Google Assistant, while Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has Siri. Between them, the two companies have billions of mobile devices in consumers’ hands, yet Amazon still managed to leapfrog them with its personal assistant hosted in a speaker, to build an impressive smart home lead.

Apple’s Siri can control HomeKit-compatible smart home devices using voice commands, and now GOOGL is rolling out a similar feature for its Google Assistant, Home Control.

Home Control

Google’s new feature for voice control of smart devices isn’t actually new. Anyone who owns both a Pixel Phone and a Google Home speaker already had a Home Control setting on their smartphone.

However, as of yesterday, GOOGL has begun to roll out Home Control to all Google Assistant users. This amounts to all Pixel Phone owners, since Google Assistant remains an exclusive that third-party Android smartphones don’t get.

With Home Control, someone with a Pixel Phone gets the same voice control ability for smart devices they would have if they owned a Google Home speaker. They can use voice commands on their phone to change the temperature on their Nest Learning Thermostat or turn off the smart lighting in the room they just left.

The Battle for the Smart Home Enters a New Phase (Sort of)

At the start of this fight to be the company that becomes the hub of the smart home — the one who controls all those smart devices — the smartphone was it.

Since the end of 2014, Amazon's unearned revenue liability increased from $1.8 billion to $4.8 billion. Some investors might see a growing liability and think that's bad news, but in fact this is very good news.

Unearned revenue is simply cash customers have paid to Amazon in advance for services it has yet to render. For example, Prime members typically pay $99 up front for a full year of the two-day shipping program. Amazon immediately takes the cash and puts it on its balance sheet, but it amortizes the $99 of revenue over the 12 months of the membership. So it accounts for only $8.25 per month in revenue per month for each Prime member. The rest of the cash received for Prime is held in the unearned-revenue balance.

Prime growth has been very good over the past few years. Amazon says it added ""tens of millions"" of new members last year. But Prime isn't the biggest driver of unearned revenue. More likely, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the biggest factor pushing the balance higher.

Image source: Getty Images.

Maybe last quarter wasn't so disappointing

For the first time since Amazon started breaking out AWS revenue and income, the cloud-computing segment missed analysts' expectations. Sales totaled $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter, where analysts were expecting $3.6 billion on average.

But unearned revenue climbed $568 million from the previous quarter. That's unusual for Amazon's fourth quarter. Usually, unearned revenue spikes in the first quarter as cloud customers presumably re-up short-term contracts for the year.

Most of Amazon's AWS customers are small businesses using its pay-as-you-go pricing, which allows them to quickly scale their use. The solution works well for companies with small or unpredictable user bases.

But a lot of AWS's money comes from the big enterprises that spend hundreds of millions every year on cloud computing. For those companies, with more predictable usage needs, Amazon offers ""reserved instances,"" which offers a discount if customers pay up front. Growth in reserved instances, or other long-term contracts, may have resulted in lower revenue in the short term, but it nearly guaranteed revenue in the future.

Locking in customers

As the competition for cloud-computing infrastructure continues to heat up, long-term contracts may prove invaluable. Locking in customers for a relatively long term means those enterprises will start optimizing their code so that it runs more efficiently on the specific hardware and platform they're using.

Such is the case with Snap (NYSE: SNAP) , which uses Google's cloud. In its S-1 filing, Snap says it built its app to use ""services provided by Google, some of which do not have an alternative in the market,"" as Re/Code's Peter Guagenti points out. Not only did Snap just agree to a $2 billion five-year contract with Google, but it's also going to be hard for it to leave Google even after the five years is up. That's excellent news for Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) investors., and not as excellent for Snap investors.

Ultimately, signing long-term contracts provides a moat against the growing competition. Not only does it lock in customers for the length of the contract, but it could also lock them in longer if they become dependent on certain features of a cloud platform. In that light, Amazon's fourth-quarter AWS results look quite strong.

After delaying the release for months, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) finally launched Android Wear 2.0, the new version of its smartwatch operating system. Along with the new OS, which incorporates advanced features like Google Assistant, new Google smartwatch hardware was announced. Made in partnership with LG , the new devices are premium quality, made to take full advantage of Android Wear 2.0 and ready to take on the Apple Watch.

Source: Google

Here's what you need to know.

Google knows it didn't exactly hit the ball out of the park when it first released its Android Wear smartwatch OS. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has dominated the smartwatch market since its release and despite an overall cooling for smartwatches in general, it looks as though Apple Watch absolutely destroyed the competition over Christmas .

That has to be especially galling to Google, considering the Apple Watch is only compatible with iPhones, while Android Wear smartwatches work with nearly 90% of the smartphones being sold today. And while Apple Watch remains locked into a clunky square watch face, Android Wear supports the traditional, round wristwatch look.

Android Wear 2.0 Key Features

Google was originally supposed to release Android Wear 2.0 last September, but decided to delay it to this spring . The official announcement landed yesterday afternoon on GOOGL's blog.

What did Google engineers spend the extra time working on? It appears that they had several major goals: improving on the basic features most smartwatch owners use (such as fitness tracking), cutting the cord to a smartphone with LTE support, and making Android Wear 2.0 smartwatches as compatible as possible with the iPhone.

Key features Google is showing off include:

Improved fitness tracking with Google Fit app

LTE support for running apps and making voice calls directly from a smartwatch without requiring connection to a smartphone

Google Assistant is integrated

Customizable watch face components

Google Play access direct from smartwatch

Support for hardware control similar to Apple Watch digital crown

In particular, the ability for more apps to run independently on Android Wear 2.0 devices - with no need to be connected to a smartwatch - means iPhone users will get almost the same experience as Android phone owners. Assuming GOOGL can convince them to skip the Apple Watch.

New Google Smartwatch Is From LG

Rumors had been flying that alongside the new operating system, the first Google smartwatch would make an appearance. That made sense considering GOOGL's push into branded hardware with the Google Pixel Phone and devices like Google Home and Google WiFi.

However, the two new smartwatches unveiled as part of the announcement are from LG, in collaboration with GOOGL.

The LG Watch Style is a relatively basic model. It lacks advanced capabilities like GPS (or even a heart rate monitor), but delivers smartwatch features in a slim, traditional wristwatch form factor. The round display is a 1.2-inch OLED screen at 360 x 360 pixel resolution and the watch has all-day battery life. It comes with a leather strap and for an extra $30, a Rose Gold color option.

The LG Watch Style is the bigger and more capable device, fully able to take full advantage of all Android Wear 2.0's new features. The 1.38-inch P-OLED display has a crisp 480 x 480 pixel resolution. The round frame is stainless steel, with IP68 water resistance. There's a heart rate monitor and GPS for fitness, Connectivity includes Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, LTE and NFC for Android Pay. Battery life is rated for all-day, but use of features like LTE and the heart rate monitor can significantly cut that.

They're premium devices, designed to take on the Apple Watch and GOOGL's involvement means they make the most of Android Wear 2.0. But they aren't the official Google smartwatch … well see if that comes later.

Availability and Pricing

Google says Android Wear 2.0 will begin rolling out ""in the coming weeks."" Most current Android Wear smartwatches should be eligible for the free update, but not all watches will support all features. The LG Watch Style and LG Watch Sport will retail for $249 and $349 respectively and will go on sale in the U.S. starting Feb. 10.

The post Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Finally Fires Back at Apple With Android Wear 2.0 appeared first on InvestorPlace .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2/9/2017,0.457450682,0.138907876,809.51,810.66,804.54,809.56,990391,6.12,0.05,1,"One of the many interesting details revealed in Snap 's S-1 filing with the SEC is that it agreed to a $2 billion contract with Google Cloud in January. The agreement with the Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary spans five years with relatively equal payments scheduled for every year.

Snap has used Google Cloud since its creation, but had been spending considerably less than the $400 million per year it's slated to spend through 2021. For the first few years of its existence, it spent less than $30 million per year on Google Cloud. Last year, however, it started seeing its hosting costs increase considerably, up $192 million for the year.

Image Source: Getty

Google's cloud service competes against the larger Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Web Services and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure. A $2 billion infusion could help it catch up to the competition.

What does $2 billion mean to Google Cloud?

Alphabet isn't exactly forthright with its cloud revenue. It lumps Google Cloud in with Google's other revenue line item, which also includes Google Play and hardware sales. In 2016, the three categories produced $10.1 billion in revenue. Google Play likely accounts for the bulk of revenue.

The cloud unit had an estimated run rate of just $1 billion as of the end of 2015, according to RBC Capital. Snap's new contract likely makes it Google's biggest cloud customer.

While Google has made several advancements in its cloud services over the past year, so have its competitors. Microsoft boasted that its Azure revenue increased 93% last quarter, but Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss estimates the unit brought in just $1.6 billion. Bernstein's Mark Mordler estimates Azure's run rate at $3 billion as of last quarter.

Meanwhile, Amazon just reported AWS sales topped $12 billion in 2016. Sales surpassed $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter alone, although that fell short of analysts expectations.

Google still needs to diversify

The growth of Snapchat has been a major boon to Google's cloud services, but it's still actively seeking to pull customers away from its competitors and take market share. The hiring of cloud-computing veteran Diane Greene to lead the division has helped the company attract numerous high-profile customers, but there's still more work to do.

On Alphabet's fourth-quarter earnings call, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said, ""We have truly differentiated offerings in four key areas: data analytics and machine learning, security and privacy, tools for application development, and the ability to create connected business platforms."" Snap can take advantage of at least three of those four factors, so it's clear why it was willing to lock down a long-term contract.

At the same time, the contract is not exclusive. If Snap wants to enter China, for example, where Google doesn't operate, it could tap one of Google's competitors. Or it could build its own servers.

Snap recently hired Jerry Hunter from AWS, who ran global data centers for the cloud-computing giant. In Snap's S-1 filing, management notes, ""In the future, we may invest in building our own infrastructure to better serve our customers.""

If Snap continues to grow at the pace it has been for the last few years, it may make economic sense for it to switch to its own cloud infrastructure, which would be a huge blow for Google.

What this means for Snap

Snap is now on the hook for $400 million per year in cloud costs. There is some wiggle room: The contract says it can postpone up to 15% of expenses for a year, so it only has to spend $340 million this first year. Still, that's a huge amount for a company that generated just $404.5 million in revenue last year.

It also means that switching service providers will be difficult, considering it would either have to eat the contract as a loss, or leave at least some of its operations on Google Cloud in order not to waste the money. That makes the economics of building out its own infrastructure within the next five years even costlier.

On the flip side, analysts expect Snap's revenue to continue growing at a rapid pace, approaching $1 billion this year fueled by continued user growth and product expansion that will surely put additional demands on Google's servers. It has plenty of capital to cover the expense, and if last year's growth is any indication of what to expect, it will need to spend at least $340 million on cloud infrastructure this year. The deal with Google ensures that it gets the lowest rates possible, so it can to make the most of its spend.

Overall, it's not a bad deal for Snap, but it does tie the company to Google for a long time.

Companies often modify their initial registration statements leading up to their IPOs, prior to issuing a formal prospectus. Prospective investors already knew that Snap is a big spender at Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google Cloud, which it relies on for its cloud infrastructure needs.

Snap is unique in its continued use of third-party infrastructure vendors at the scale at which it is operating ; most companies invest in their own infrastructure once they grow to a point where it's warranted. To a lesser extent, Snap also purchases infrastructure services from Amazon.com 's(NASDAQ: AMZN) AWS.

In the amended filing, Snap provided some additional detail on its relationship with the e-commerce giant.

Always have a contingency plan

To be clear, Google Cloud is still Snap's main flame, but it never hurts to have backup. In fact, contingency planning is absolutely critical when your entire service relies on third-party infrastructure partners, and this is the role that AWS will play. The deal was inked just yesterday, which is what's triggering the S-1 amendment.

In last week's version, Snap said: ""We are currently negotiating an agreement with another cloud provider for redundant infrastructure support of our business operations."" That line was replaced in this week's version with: ""We have also committed to spend $1 billion with Amazon Web Services over the next five years for redundant infrastructure support of our business operations."" Snap says an existing agreement with AWS that was originally entered into in March 2016 was amended on Feb. 8, 2017.

That $1 billion commitment will slowly ramp up, starting with $50 million in spending this year. That's a tiny drop in the bucket compared to the $12.2 billion in sales that AWS did in 2016. Snap is on the hook to spend $350 million with AWS in 2021. In contrast, the agreement with Google Cloud that was finalized on Jan. 30, 2017 calls for a flat $400 million per year for five years, with a little bit of leeway in shifting spending to subsequent years (up to 15% in each of the first four years).

Data source: Snapchat amended S-1. Chart by author.

Combined with its $2 billion commitment with Google Cloud, we're looking at $3 billion pledged between Google Cloud and AWS over the next five years. Snap's cloud strategy of relying entirely on third-party partners is risky for many operational reasons, but that's an awful lot of financial pressure for the start-up. In 2016, cost of revenue exceeded revenue, resulting in a negative gross profit of nearly $50 million, and infrastructure costs are the largest component of cost of revenue.

Snap only recently rolled out its automated ad sales API in October, which exited beta just a couple weeks ago. The company will now need to ramp ad sales faster than its infrastructure spending commitments if it hopes to generate gross profit in the years ahead. And we haven't even started talking about operating expenses yet, which totaled $473 million last year.

Hopefully, that API works pretty darn well.

Shares of salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM) rose 15.5% in January of 2017, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence .

So what

This month-long surge started on Jan. 4, when the company published a ""state of the service"" report that painted Salesforce's target market in bright, cheerful colors. The momentum continued as several analyst firms issued positive research reports on the stock, often describing it as a probable turnaround winner.

Image source: Getty Images.

Finally, as January wrapped up, rumor had it that Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) might be preparing a buyout offer for the company.

Now what

Of course, Alphabet has not presented any takeover bid for Salesforce, and I'd be surprised to see it happen. January's burst of share price gains came after a disappointing 2016 as a whole , setting the bar low for quick gains.

CRM data by YCharts .

Is there a solid turnaround on the horizon? Salesforce does generate plenty of cash, but the stock valuation remains firmly in the nosebleed section. The stock is simply priced for absolute perfection. I'm more than comfortable staying on the sidelines -- but sudden price drops could make Salesforce shares interesting. This one goes on my long-term watch list.

Revenue rose 22% annually to $43.7 billion, but that missed expectations by $980 million. The company was hit hard by currency headwinds, which reduced its top line by about $558 million. Amazon's closely watched AWS (Amazon Web Services) revenue rose 47% annually to $3.54 billion, but that also missed expectations of $3.6 billion and represented a slowdown from 55% growth in the third quarter.

For the first quarter, Amazon expects 14.1% to 22.7% year-over-year sales growth, which missed analyst forecasts for 23.4% growth. But on a currency neutral basis, which excludes an expected currency impact of $730 million, Amazon expects its revenue to rise 17% to 25%.

Image source: Amazon.

Some negative reports about Amazon focused on those headline numbers, but they glossed over many of the positive growth figures. Let's take a look at six incredible numbers from that report that investors shouldn't overlook.

1. $749 million in net income

During the fourth quarter, Amazon's net income rose 55% annually to $749 million, or $1.54 per share -- which beat expectations by $0.19. For the full year, its net income surged over 300% to $2.4 billion.

That incredible growth was mostly attributed to the rapid growth of AWS' high-margin business, which gives Amazon much more freedom to expand its e-commerce ecosystem with low-margin hardware like its Echo speakers, loss-leading services like Amazon Video and Prime Now, and logistics solutions like new fulfillment centers and drones.

2. AWS' operating margin of 26%

AWS finished last quarter with an operating margin of 26%, compared to 24% in the year-ago quarter. That margin expansion indicates that AWS' massive scale is offsetting tough price competition across the cloud platform market, which caused Amazon and its rivals to reduce their prices throughout the year.

3. AWS' annual run rate of $14 billion

Amazon announced that AWS had achieved an annual run rate of $14 billion, indicating that it maintains a commanding lead over Microsoft 's(NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure in the cloud platform race.

Microsoft claimed that its ""commercial cloud"" had achieved an annual run rate of over $14 billion last quarter, but most of that total came from SaaS platforms like Office 365 and Dynamics CRM. Azure -- which competes directly against AWS in the IaaS/PaaS ""cloud platform"" markets -- accounts for a much smaller percentage.

Microsoft doesn't disclose how much revenue Azure generates, but combining earlier industry estimates and its reported growth rate over the past few quarters indicates that its annual run rate could be around $3 billion.

4. Over 1,000 new AWS features

Amazon already serves massive customers like NASA, the CDC, and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) with AWS, but it's continuously widening the platform's competitive moat against rival platforms like Azure with new features. Amazon added over 1,000 new features and services to AWS in fiscal 2016, compared to about 700 in 2015.

It also opened eleven new AWS Availability Zones across five geographic regions in 2016, bringing AWS' total coverage to 42 Availability Zones across 16 regions globally. That massive data center expansion will help AWS reach more companies and developers, all while supporting the expansion of its e-commerce and digital ecosystem into new markets.

5. Prime Video in over 200 countries

A big part of that digital ecosystem expansion is Prime Video, the company's streaming answer to Netflix. Amazon has made the platform a ""free"" perk for Prime subscribers and a stand-alone subscription service that costs slightly less than Netflix.

Like Netflix, Amazon is investing heavily in original content, and popular shows like Transparent and Man in the High Castle helped it become the third largest video streaming platform in the U.S. after YouTube and Netflix last year, according to research firm Sandvine. Amazon is also following Netflix's lead and investing heavily in localized original content in key markets like Japan and India, which could help expand its Prime user base worldwide.

6. 4,000 new skills for Alexa

Amazon also taught its voice recognition platform Alexa 4,000 new skills since last October. It noted that ""tens of thousands of developers"" are building new skills for the platform -- which powers the Echo, Kindle, and Fire TV devices -- and that it was working with ""a lot of major companies"" to integrate their products with that ecosystem.

The expansion of the Alexa ecosystem is important, because it can give Amazon control of users' connected homes via Dash buttons, DRS-enabled appliances, and other connected devices. In addition to boosting its e-commerce revenue with ""frictionless"" orders, that platform can process data through AWS and widen its moat in the smart home race against Alphabet 's Google, which is trying to establish its own home-based ecosystem around its Home smart speaker.

The key takeaway

Amazon's fourth quarter report was lumpy, but investors shouldn't overlook these positive numbers. Analysts still expect Amazon's revenue and earnings to respectively rise 22% and 53% next year -- so its overall growth won't peak anytime soon. Therefore, I believe that investors should take advantage of Amazon's temporary swoon and pick up a few more shares for the long term.

Along with the new OS, which incorporates advanced features like Google Assistant, new Google smartwatch hardware was announced. Made in partnership with LG, the new devices are premium quality, made to take full advantage of Android Wear 2.0 and ready to take on the Apple Watch.

Source: Google

Here’s what you need to know.

Google knows it didn’t exactly hit the ball out of the park when it first released its Android Wear smartwatch OS. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has dominated the smartwatch market since its release and despite an overall cooling for smartwatches in general, it looks as though Apple Watch absolutely destroyed the competition over Christmas.

That has to be especially galling to Google, considering the Apple Watch is only compatible with iPhones, while Android Wear smartwatches work with nearly 90% of the smartphones being sold today. And while Apple Watch remains locked into a clunky square watch face, Android Wear supports the traditional, round wristwatch look.

Android Wear 2.0 Key Features

Google was originally supposed to release Android Wear 2.0 last September, but decided to delay it to this spring. The official announcement landed yesterday afternoon on GOOGL’s blog.

What did Google engineers spend the extra time working on? It appears that they had several major goals: improving on the basic features most smartwatch owners use (such as fitness tracking), cutting the cord to a smartphone with LTE support, and making Android Wear 2.0 smartwatches as compatible as possible with the iPhone.

Key features Google is showing off include:

Improved fitness tracking with Google Fit app

LTE support for running apps and making voice calls directly from a smartwatch without requiring connection to a smartphone

Google Assistant is integrated

Customizable watch face components

Google Play access direct from smartwatch

Support for hardware control similar to Apple Watch digital crown

In particular, the ability for more apps to run independently on Android Wear 2.0 devices — with no need to be connected to a smartwatch — means iPhone users will get almost the same experience as Android phone owners. Assuming GOOGL can convince them to skip the Apple Watch.

Google’s Chrome browser is used by over 62% of the world’s PC users, but it’s a notorious battery hog that if left to run rampant can reduce your laptop or tablet to just a couple of hours of life. But it doesn’t have to be like that, as Google is making efforts to improve it. In the meantime, here are some tips to get Chrome’s battery usage under control without sacrificing functionality.

1) Update your Chrome

This one might sound like a no-brainer, but you’d be surprised how many people do not update Chrome. Google’s recent versions of Chrome have become much more efficient and faster.

To check your version of Chrome is up to date, type “chrome://help/” into the address bar and hit enter. It shows a version number and a link to check for and install updates or a notice saying that Google Chrome is up to date. Updating shouldn’t take long and you can continue to use Chrome until it has been downloaded. Then Chrome will reboot, but you won’t have to restart your computer.

2) Suspend those tabs

One of the best bits of the modern browser is the ability to have multiple tabs. One or two is OK, but when you end up with 20 or so sitting idle in your browser your battery pays the price.

Getting rid of tabs is a good start, but if you don’t want to change your usage, suspending tabs can be even better.

The Great Suspender is the tool you need. If you don’t use a tab for a few minutes, the Great Suspender will unload it, removing its workload on your computer but keeping the tab there ready to go again when you need it. All you have to do is click into the tab to reload it and continue where you left off.

It won’t suspend anything with active input, such as text chats or similar, while you can temporarily whitelist tabs, or permanently whitelist a whole domain so that your Guardian articles never get unloaded, for instance.

Other tab suspender tools are also available on the Chrome store, should the Great Suspender not fit the bill, including those that can suspend a group of tabs and restore them as one complete session.

3) Remove unnecessary extensions

Extensions are part of what makes Chrome great, but each extension added to Chrome can increase its load on your computer, slowing it down and eating more battery life.

Simply disabling or removing them entirely from Chrome, particularly big or feature-packed ones such as those that allow the use of tools offline can dramatically reduce Chromes impact on your PC.

Type “chrome://extensions/” into the address bar and hit enter. Then all you have to do is click the box to either disable them, or the bin icon to remove them entirely. Try disabling them first, and if it doesn’t break anything you use regularly, then trash it. You can always add them back from the Chrome web store if you find you miss them.

4) Stop Chrome running in the background

Even once you’ve closed Chrome you might find it sticks around, consuming power unnecessarily. That’s because Chrome can run, often hidden in your system tray on Windows or your Dock on MacOS in support of web apps. Google’s Hangouts chat app, for instance, needs Chrome to run all the time to work. But in doing so it’s eating your laptop’s battery and hogging your computer’s resources.

To stop it from happening on Windows, find the Chrome icon in your system tray on the right-hand side of the screen (usually hidden under the little arrow). Right click on it, and uncheck “Let Chrome run in the background”. An alternative same setting can be found under advanced settings:

Type “chrome://settings/” into the address bar. Hit enter. Click the “Show advanced settings” link to expand the menu, scroll to the bottom and uncheck “Continue running background apps when Google Chrome is closed”.

To then run all the web apps your might have installed, such as Hangouts or Signal, you’ll have to keep Chrome open. But at least when you close Chrome it really will shut off.

5) Disable Google Drive offline access

Another tool Chrome uses for web apps that could be draining your battery life unnecessarily are background pages. They’re loaded in the background, as you might assume, and sit there ready for the web app. Signal’s Chrome app uses one, for instance, but one that is relatively heavy that you may or may not use or know you have enabled is Google Drive offline access for Docs, Sheets, Slides and Drawings.

It’s only useful for those documents you’ve stored offline and need to edit offline. For everything else it’s just a waste of computer resources.

To turn it off head to drive.google.com, click the settings cog in the right-hand corner and uncheck the box for Offline. It can always be re-enabled should you find you do need it at a later date.

6) Block Flash and make plugins click-to-play

In general browsing, many of the most demanding and therefore battery-draining elements on a page require a plugin, such as Adobe’s much maligned Flash, to run. By being selective about the plugins that run on a page you can make some of the worst offenders have less of an impact on your computer.

You can manually disable individual plugins, but the easiest way to save battery with plugins is to make them request to run each time. Then you can click and run the ones you want on the page – say for the video you want to see – without letting any of the others run unnecessarily.

Type “chrome://settings/” into the address bar. Hit enter. Click the “Show advanced settings” link to expand the menu and click the box marked “Content settings ... ” under Privacy.

On the latest version of Chrome scroll to “Unsandboxed plug-in access” and make sure the box marked “Ask when a site wants to use a plug-in to access your computer” is checked. It’s also worth checking the box marked “Block sites from running Flash” under Flash, although you may use some sites and services that still require Flash – you can add these as exceptions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2/8/2017,0.505552135,0.193274411,807,811.84,803.19,808.38,1155990,8.65,1.38,1,"Google is officially launching Android Wear 2.0 today — the biggest update to the company’s wearable operating system since its launch in 2014.

If you’re not a Wear aficionado who has been patiently waiting for this release, you probably remember Wear 2.0 from its Google I/O announcement last May. Even though in day-to-day use, the updated version feels very much like the next logical evolution of Wear, it took Google far longer than expected to launch it.

“The approach that we took as we got started was to build an ecosystem of partners — so not just do a one-size-fit all solution,” David Singleton, the head of the Google Wear project, told me. “But build an ecosystem of partners to create a diverse set of styles and sizes. We felt strongly that it was time to work with our traditional — but also non-traditional — partners to create this ecosystem.”

While the overall outlook on the market doesn’t always look positive, Singleton argues that Google saw double-digit growth in activations year-over-year. Only looking at the holiday season, Google says it saw 70 percent year-over-year growth.

Today, however, Wear 2.0 is launching with two new flagship watches from LG: the gargantuan, feature-rich LG Watch Sport and the comparatively demure and pared-down LG Watch Style. You can find our respective reviews here and here. A number of existing Wear watches will also get this update in the coming weeks and months.

Even though it took Google a few months longer than expected to roll out Wear 2.0, which meant its partners missed the ever-important December shopping season, the final version that’s launching today still sticks to the basics Google announced last year. New features include support for standalone apps, Android Pay, dials and — of course — the Google Assistant.

As Singleton stressed, the idea behind all of this work was to take what the team learned from how people used the previous version and focus on making exactly those things easier.

The one thing Singleton and his team seemed to be especially excited about was the ability to quickly change watch faces in Wear 2.0. In earlier versions, you had to perform a long press on the watch face to switch faces. Now you can simply sweep left or right to change them. I admit that I don’t fully share their enthusiasm for this feature, but, to be fair, it does make switching between a work-centric watch face with your calendar and a fancier one for after work a bit easier.

As far as the watch faces go, though, the one feature I definitely was able to get excited about is that the new designs now have slots for showing data from third-party applications. Maybe you want to see your battery life there, or your steps from Google Fit, or how much water you drank from Lifesum, or the outdoor temperature based on data from the Weather.com app. This is now a deep, built-in feature of Wear 2.0 that allows third-party services to make this data available on the watch face. It’s up to the designers to decide how they want to display this info, and the new LG watches already show a couple of different options for this.

Before any of this, though, the first thing you’ll notice when you get a 2.0 watch is the overall update to its design — both in terms of the overall look but also the user experience. The look of Wear 2.0 now skews closer to Google’s Material Design guidelines. While the overall look will still feel familiar to Wear 1.x users, the update put a stronger emphasis on cards, for example. This means every notification now gets a full screen to show its preview and you can use the watch’s dial to scroll through them (assuming your watch has a dial, of course. — otherwise you can obviously still use the touch screen to scroll).

The other marquee feature of Wear 2.0 is support for standalone apps that don’t need a companion app to run on your phone. That means developers can write apps that are purely geared toward the watch and they can then publish it on the Google Play store, which is now also available directly on the watch. That sounds more useful than it is — unless you plan on getting an LTE-enabled watch and leave your phone at home. That’s an option now that you could run Hangout or Google Music directly on the watch, but, except for runners, that’s likely not a typical use case. At the end of the day, the most important use case for a smartwatch remains dealing with notifications. Everything else often feels like an unnecessary complication.

For the most part, the standalone apps that are available right now aren’t all that exciting either. There also aren’t all that many available right now. Some of the apps Google promised for the launch include Foursquare, Robin Hood, Runkeeper, Runtastic, Strava, Todoist, Nest and Uber. The team specifically singled out Google’s own Fit app, too, which now supports more exercises than before, in addition to an interactive coaching experience.

To be fair, Wear 2.0 does make it easier to use these apps. To get to them, you only have to push the watch’s dial. In addition, you also can use the dial to scroll through them. Instinctively, I assumed that I could then start an app by pressing the dial again, but that just takes you back to the home screen.

Still, the additional support for dials and buttons is an admission on Google’s part that smartwatches should have some kind of physical button. The Wear 1.0 launch device — the LG Watch — famously didn’t have any physical buttons (not even to turn it on). The new LG Watch Sport however has two buttons and a dial and Wear 2.0 makes it easy to assign various functions to them, too. That makes using these watches easier at times, but it’s not exactly a revolutionary breakthrough.

Android Wear now also features a keyboard. That may sound like an insane idea, given how small these watches’ screens are, but because it uses Google’s predictive technology, it works surprisingly well. You wouldn’t want to use if for typing long messages, and it’s really more about swiping than pecking for individual letters, but if you’re in a place where using voice input isn’t an option, it’s a good alternative.

Wear has gotten significantly smarter, though. It now features support for the Google Assistant and smart replies. The Assistant on the watch works just as well as on any other device, including the Google Home or the Pixel. There really isn’t much more to say here. Google Now on Android Wear was already pretty useful, too, after all (and where Now ends and the Assistant starts isn’t always clear anyway). It would be nice if you could also type questions so that you could use the Assistant in a quiet room. Singleton says that’s something the team is thinking about.

Smart Replies may actually be the more exciting feature here. It looks at your conversation and then suggests possible replies based on its understanding. I never found that very useful in Inbox, where this made its debut, but on the go, it sure makes answering messages easier. Singleton told me that the algorithms for Smart Replies actually run right on the watch.

It’s an evolution

Looking at the list of features, this may not sound like a major update and more like a series of incremental updates to existing parts of Wear 1.x. We also ran into our fair share of bugs while testing the new LG watches. After first setting the LG Watch Style up, for example, we got stuck in tutorial mode and didn’t receive any notifications until we reset the watch. An emergency patch Google released over the last weekend fixed most of these issues, however, so I assume the final version that rolls out to consumers won’t have these issues.

The new LG watches are interesting in their own ways and they showcase the new features of Wear 2.0. The LG Watch Sport, especially, feels like Google and LG wanted to show off every possible feature of Wear 2.0, but that doesn’t necessarily make for a great watch. The smaller and cheaper LG Watch Style, on the other hand, shows a more restrained approach.

The Android smartwatch market could use a revolution to kickstart what now occasionally feels like a moribund ecosystem. Wear 2.0 doesn’t feel revolutionary. It is, however, a perfectly adequate update that addresses many of the issues with Android Wear. It also puts it on parity with its competitors, like Apple’s watchOS or Samsung’s Tizen.

As a result, co-founders Evan Spiegel and Bob Murphy will continue to control a combined 88.6% of the company -- 44.3% each. ""Although other U.S.-based companies have publicly traded classes of non-voting stock, to our knowledge, no other company has completed an initial public offering of non-voting stock on a U.S. stock exchange,"" management wrote in its S-1 filing.

Indeed, other companies have restructured their stock classes so that a founder-CEO can remain in control. Snap is just being more blunt about who's really running the show here.

Most recently, Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) announced plans for a stock split so Mark Zuckerberg could maintain control of the company as he gives away most of his wealth to nonprofits and other causes. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) also restructured its shares in 2014 to keep its founders in control. Snap is setting things straight from the get-go.

A simple look at Snap's voting rights

Snap has three classes of stock, and the voting rights are laid out like so:

Class Votes Per Share Class A 0 Class B 1 Class C 10

Source: Snap S1 filing.

Individual investors will only be able to buy Class A shares at Snap's IPO. The share classes do convert. One share of Class C is convertible into one share of Class B. One share of class B is convertible into one share of Class A. (No, you can't convert shares the other way around.) As such, all shares of Snap stock, regardless of class, will participate equally in the profit of the company.

How much is a vote worth?

Alphabet has the same voting structure for its stock, with the caveat that A shares have one vote, B shares have 10, and C shares have no vote. Facebook announced it would split its shares the same way at some point in the future.

Shares of Alphabet provide the best look at how much investors value voting rights. Class A shares, which provide one vote, trade for a slight premium to the non-voting Class C shares. That premium is currently about 2.5%.

So voting rights do represent some value to shareholders, or at least potential shareholders. Activist investors could buy up a significant portion of voting rights such that they can at least have some sway at shareholder meetings. With Snap's IPO, those shares won't be available to buy.

Where things get messy

Following the IPO, Evan Spiegel will receive an additional 3% of all shares outstanding paid out quarterly over the next three years as a bonus. Those will be Class C shares, and Spiegel will then be able to exercise complete control over the company. In the meantime, there's potential for deadlock votes between Spiegel and co-founder Bob Murphy, as they each control equal-sized stakes.

But that's not the most concerning thing about the capital structure at Snap. The only way for the founders to lose control of the company is if they both die. As described in the S-1 filing, ""Either of our co-founders' shares of Class C common stock will automatically convert into Class B common stock, on a one-to-one basis, nine months following his death."" If that happens, the other co-founder will have a controlling share of the votes.

In other words, both founders could leave the company but still be able to exercise control over it.

Facebook made provisions to its stock split to ensure that Zuckerberg would only control the company's voting rights as long as he remained CEO.

There's a provision on Alphabet's Class B shareholders that for every Class C non-voting share they sell, they must convert one Class B share into a Class A share, and presumably sell that as well. That makes it more difficult for the founders to retain complete control. In fact, their combined percentage of the shareholders' vote has fallen from 61% at the time of the stock split to about 57% today.

Snap's structure makes it so that not only do individual investors have no voting rights, but the founders will continue to control the company until both of them die. That's putting a lot of trust in the founders, adding more risk to an already risky investment.

Bixby to bypass Google?

Samsung acquires Viv virtual personal assistant. Image source :Viv

Late last year, Samsung (NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) acquired Viv, an artificial intelligence company whose founders were the original developers of Apple 's Siri . With this purchase, Samsung joined the fray of the virtual personal assistant . With several more years of development under its belt, Viv was being billed as Siri's smarter sister that would work and play well with others. In addition to the standard assistant chores fare of language search, map directions, and weather, Viv was able to respond successfully respond to extremely complex questions and follow-ups, a skill lacking in other assistants. With Samsung's acquisition, Viv was updated and reemerged as Bixby, a virtual assistant which will make its debut in the soon-to-be-released Galaxy S8. Samsung has plans to integrate its recently acquired assistant into the majority of the native apps on its upcoming phone.One of the more interesting features is the camera featuring an optical character recognition system. By pointing the camera at an object, and engaging the ""Bixby"" button, it seeks to identify said item and launches a native search engine that circumvents Google search and locates the item for purchase.

There are persistent rumors that Google has tried to prevent Samsung from making Bixby the default on its phone, and it may find legal standing to do so. Samsung phones use Google's Android operating system and the pair have a non-compete as part of their patent-sharing agreement.

Google may not want Bixby to bypass its search, though it would not be the first such occurrence. Those familiar with Amazon.com 's(NASDAQ: AMZN) failed Fire phone will recall a similar feature -- Firefly -- that allowed users to take a picture of an object and launch the item listing on Amazon's website. Amazon's phone never gained any traction, so the fact that it bypassed Google's search never resulted in any significant threat to Google's search. The Galaxy S8 is unlikely to meet that same fate, even in light of the the Galaxy Note 7's recent difficulties .

Consumers begin product searches on Amazon.com

More products searches start on Amazon than Google. Image source: Amazon.com

Speaking of Amazon, a study in June 2016 by PowerReviews found that 38% of US consumers initiated a product search on Amazon versus 35% on Google.This may be only the beginning. A larger study in September 2016 by BloomReach found that 55% of consumers begin their search for a product on Amazon versus 28% on search engines. The same report issued a year earlier reported 44% and 34% respectively. Amazon revealed that it is seeking to leverage this and its massive library of product reviews by expanding paid search, which will include not only products it sells, but items not available on the site. This product and paid search will extend to its virtual personal assistant Alexa and its Echo home systems. Few details have been released by Amazon, but this will likely compete directly for Google's advertising dollars. There is not yet any indication of a wider entry into search, but with some estimates placing Amazon's Prime membership at nearly half of US households, that might provide a natural entry into the field.

Those little things can add up

Google is already dealing with lower costs-per-click as a result of the migration from desktop search to mobile, with rates falling 15% year over year in its most recent quarter. The company was able to still grow the top line 22% in the most recent quarter by making it up with volume, with aggregate paid clicks up 36% year over year.

Alphabet earns nearly 88% of all its revenue from Google's search, and small challenges like these to its dominant position could become legitimate threats to the company's cash cow over time.

Cloud infrastructure vendors have been crucial in enabling smaller start-ups, particularly those that are building mobile apps, to get up and running without having to worry as much about the back end. It's an appealing model since it allows smaller companies to simply pay for what they need without having to invest in building the infrastructure themselves. In other words, it's an OpEx model versus a CapEx model, and Google is betting big that the market is going to shift to the OpEx model in a major way in the years ahead.

But as companies grow, they often choose to invest in their own cloud infrastructure. This gives them much more control over their own destinies, reduces risk, and over time the cost efficiencies improve after the large upfront investment.

Social media peers Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) and Twitter both operate their own data centers; Facebook announced its seventh data center a few months back, while Twitter's infrastructure operations are expanding more slowly, as it operates in co-located facilities. Data centers are so strategically important to Facebook that it helped create the Open Compute Project back in 2011, publicly sharing Facebook's infrastructure innovations for the greater good.

But not Snap (NYSE: SNAP) .

Hey, big spender

Snap primarily relies on Google Cloud for its infrastructure needs. While this is entirely par for the course for mobile app start-ups, Snap has grown to a size (nearly 160 million daily active users) that would typically warrant investing in infrastructure. The sheer scale of Snap's use of Google Cloud is what's unprecedented here. The Information reports that Google landed Snap with numerous discounts and other benefits, and Snap very much relies on Google Cloud at this point, although it also uses Amazon's AWS to a lesser degree.

Back in 2014, Snap CTO Bobby Murphy said the company picked Google Cloud over AWS because the company could scale better on Google Cloud. Snap poached AWS' head of data centers in October of last year, which is a peculiar move as it may imply that Snap has longer-term ambitions to build out its own infrastructure.

But for now, Snap is firmly in bed with Google Cloud, and spends quite a bit of money. Infrastructure costs comprise the bulk of Snap's cost of revenue. From the S-1: ""Cost of revenue consists primarily of payments to third-party infrastructure partners for hosting our products. Hosting costs primarily include expenses related to bandwidth, computing, and storage costs."" Cost of revenue in 2016 was $452 million, and Snap has committed to spending $2 billion with Google Cloud over the next five years.

But at what cost?

In discussing its operating leverage, Snap believes that using a capital-light business model will translate into ""lower costs for us in both the short and long term."" That's definitely true in the short term, but much more debatable in the long term.

Having a larger proportion of fixed costs actually helps with operating leverage as the business grows, since those fixed costs get spread out over an increasing revenue base over time, reducing total average costs. In contrast, if a company's cost structure has a larger proportion of variable costs, those costs will scale commensurately with revenue, so you don't get as much margin expansion. It's already telling that Snap's cost of revenue exceeded revenue in 2016 ($405 million), resulting in negative gross margin.

We saw this all play out years ago in the semiconductor industry, with the rise of the ""fab-less"" and ""fab-lite"" models that are dominant today. Building a chip fab costs billions of dollars, which was a significant barrier to entry. Then contract chip manufacturers came around and allowed companies to focus more on designing the chips while the manufacturing partners would produce them. By outsourcing production to a few large chip manufacturers, the industry collectively saved billions and innovation flourished. Semiconductors mostly shifted to the OpEx model long ago, and there are only a handful of companies that currently manufacture their own chips these days.

Snap is wading into uncharted territory by relying on third-party infrastructure partners at this scale. Whether or not this proves right or wrong will also depend on how Snap grows from here. One thing is for sure, though: Both aspiring start-ups and infrastructure vendors will be watching closely to see how this experiment unfolds.

Financially and technically, Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) seems to have everything going its way. Facebook's latest video announcements have it playing hardball against Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX ) in the race to dominate the next generation of video. The company is rapidly approaching 2 billion users in a world with 7 billion people.

Facebook stock's fourth-quarter results were nothing short of awe-inspiring, as InvestorPlace writer Tom Taulli reported , net income rose 128% year-over-year, compared with 2015, as revenue rose 53%.

The revenue run rate is still one-third that of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ), but the companies are competing ever-more fiercely for the same internet advertisers and, increasingly, FB is winning.

So why is Facebook stock sitting below its 2017 high? Why did it rise only 2% on those incredible earnings? Why does FB stock seem stuck in first gear?

Call it the perils of leadership.

Facebook Stock and Political Opposition

Facebook has become a mirror on the human condition, and civilization's ills have come calling on it.

Gangs are now waging their turf wars on the service. Its human decision-making is opaque, and people are being destroyed by that without recourse .

Worse, despite FB's insistence that it's not a media company, and that it is not political in any way, people are treating it as both.

Many conservatives tied to the Trump Administration now count Facebook as an enemy and suspect all those who work alongside it. This is happening even while FB goes to unprecedented lengths to fight terrorist propaganda, working alongside law enforcement and security agencies .

The truth or falsehood of the political charges should be irrelevant to an investor. What matters is that Facebook is seen to be a media company, and seen to be a political actor, that it's being treated as such, and that responding to all this is expected to cost money, reducing margins and net income.

Fortunately, FB stock has a way to fight back.

FB Stock: A Turing Test

Facebook stock is in a race against billions of people who want its network to pass a Turing Test. Its network must pretend to be human, and to act humanely, without using people to do it.

Here are just some examples of what I'm talking about.

FB must act against fake news , phishing profiles created by criminals , charges of political favoritism, plus millions of individual complaints about the actions of third parties, large and small , in an automated fashion.

This is because software scales in ways people cannot. If Facebook must go to court constantly in order to protect itself, it can't continue to grow. It must automate its own self-policing, as with a recent patent application aimed at fighting a photo-tag spambot.

At the same time, FB stock must fight charges that its software is becoming bloated, dense and difficult to use. It must accept the increased complexity of video rights management in this regard. It also must accept the fact that mistakes will be made by software acting in human ways, just as people make mistakes.

Fortunately, all I'm describing is a need for more artificial intelligence, and that happens to be the area in software where Facebook is putting a lot of its money right now.

The company's recent delivery of a system for identifying the content of photos, and allowing them to be searched as text is searched , is just the tip of the iceberg for what's ahead for Facebook stock.

By fighting for its own survival with artificial intelligence, FB stock is pointing the way to a future defined by artificial intelligence . This is less about creating an ""artificial assistant,"" like Amazon's Alexa or Google Home, both advertised during last week's Super Bowl, and more about creating intelligence within the network so questions are answered before they are asked.

If Facebook stock can succeed here, it can overcome both its own problems and a lot of yours, to mutual profit.

But one company is starting to emerge as a potential contender to the two ad behemoths: Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) is starting to spread its wings as an advertiser.

Amazon certainly has the user data to compete with Facebook or the big Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary. Although it has only 300 million active customers as of its last update, the shopping data it has on those users is invaluable. In fact, Amazon may be able to target advertisements better than Facebook or Google despite their huge troves of user data. After all, nothing speaks louder than how people spend their money.

What's this other revenue line item, and why's it growing so quickly?

During Amazon's fourth-quarter earnings call, UBS analyst Eric Sheridan asked about the ""other"" line item on Amazon's income statement. He pointed out that it's exhibited a lot of momentum over the past few years and wondered if that was due to growth in advertising.

The other category includes ""certain advertising services and our co-branded credit card agreements,"" according to Amazon's quarterly report. While Amazon did just revamp its credit card offering, it's been around in some form in the U.S. since 2002 and in Canada since 2012. The vast majority of growth in the category is probably coming from advertising.

And it's been growing. Last year, other revenue in North America increased 60%. That accelerated to 81% growth in the fourth quarter. That makes it Amazon's fastest growing source of revenue, growing even faster than its cloud-computing service, Amazon Web Services.

Granted, the other revenue Amazon brings in accounted for just 1.7% of its total North American sales -- $1.3 billion. So it's still working on a very small revenue base.

Expanding its ad products

Most of the ads Amazon sells are on its own websites. Search results on Amazon have an increasing number of sponsored products, with which third-party merchants pay to show up at the top of the page, not unlike Google's search advertising. Management described sponsored products as ""off to a great start,"" indicating they see a lot of room for expansion.

A report from BloomReach last fall found that 55% of online shoppers begin their product search on Amazon.com. As more and more people search Amazon for products, the more ads it can show. In fact, sponsored products could start stealing ad budgets away from Google, which is why Eric Schmidt said it's Google's biggest competitor in 2014.

But Amazon's advertising is starting to extend beyond its own websites, wading deep into Google's territory. Last year it developed a header-bidding solution. Header bidding allows publishers to take more offers for their ad inventory instead of wading through each offer one by one and taking the first decent one they find. (This is all done extremely quickly by computer algorithms.)

Amazon's advantage in the space is that it can perform the complex algorithmic ad bidding process in its AWS servers, enabling publishers' websites to load faster than other header-bidding systems allow. Google has historically dominated the space that header bidding threatens.

As mentioned, Amazon is one of the few companies with user data that can compete with the targeting capabilities of Facebook or Google. So if it continues to build out its advertising products on third-party websites, it could start to take a significant share of revenue from Google and Facebook. Google generated $15.6 billion in revenue from its network members' websites last year. Facebook's Audience Network reached a $1 billion run rate in the fourth quarter last year, but the company hasn't provided any updates since then.

The digital ad market is huge. Advertisers spent $195 billion worldwide on online ads last year, according to eMarketer. That number is expected to grow to $335 billion by 2020. If Amazon can grab just a slice of the market producing high-margin revenue, it could provide a significant boost to its bottom line.

A new study shows that it's further along than previously thought, which is a good sign for investors, even if they're not happy with the company's fourth-quarter results.

The California Department of Motor Vehicles released a number of reports earlier this month from various automakers and tech companies on what they're doing as it relates to self-driving cars and GM, long thought to be ceding the race, has vaulted its position, thanks to acquisitions and heavy spending.

Cruise Automation, which GM bought for more than $1 billion in March 2016, is using a bunch of Chevrolet Bolt EVs to test its software and its cars out in the field. Cruise now has more than 20 vehicles licensed in California, up from just two in early 2016, when it was using a couple of Nissan Leafs.

This is a bright sign for the Mary Barra-led company, as it looks to own the entire ecosystem of the next version of the automobile, instead of ceding the race to others.

It's likely to keep dealing further into in this area, whether it's partnering with Lyft or adding engineers to its self-driving car fleet in order to keep testing and building cars in Detroit.

Projects like this are likely to help shareholders in the long-run, even if it impacts spending in the interim.

In the fourth-quarter, GM earned $1.28 a share on $43.91 billion, ahead of estimates $1.17 a share on $41.53 billion in sales. Despite the earnings beat, investors sent shares lower on concerns of a slowdown in auto sales for 2017, as well as the potential for elevated inventory levels.

It's unclear what impact, if any, self-driving cars are likely to have to vehicle volumes in the future. There may be a need for less cars, since they could be working more efficiently. Or there may be a need for a massive resurgence in sales, as costs come down and regulators incentivize manufacturers to make transportation safer.

It's just a huge unknown at this point.

GM has been building and manufacturing cars for over 100 years, giving it a leg up, at least in terms of the manufacturing process, over any of its Silicon Valley competitors. This is something that Barra has consistently cited as an advantage.

“We have 100 years of really understanding vehicles, putting them on the road, making sure we have a safe, high-quality vehicle,” Barra told reporters at a December press conference. “When you take autonomous, electrification, connectivity, I think we are going to have a very special offering to the consumer.”

The world is still a ways away from Level 5 autonomy (true autonomy, in which a car can drive by itself in any condition anywhere without any help from a human), so the self-driving car race is far from over.

But it looks like GM, which has notoriously been secretive about its operations, is a lot further along than anyone thought. And that's something shareholders can rest easy about.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Form S-1 is used to register securities with the SEC and provides prospective investors the first glimpse at a company's financials and other data the company wishes to disclose. Snap's S-1 has the standard balance sheet and income and cash flow statements, but it includes a lot of juicy details, as well.

Image source: Snap, Author.

We already know millennials love Snapchat, and management made sure to highlight that fact. But should investors be equally enamored with the highly anticipated IPO?

Key financials

Metric/Year 2015 2016 Revenue $58.7 million $404.5 million Net income ($372.9 million) ($514.6 million) Free cash flow ($325.8 million) ($677.7 million)

Snap S-1 SEC filing.

Snap is considered a growth company, and as such, its main focus is on improving its top line. To that end, it managed to increase revenue to $404.5 million last year from $58.7 million the year before. That growth was fueled by an increase in the total number of ads shown per user, as well as an increase in total users. Snap introduced several new ad formats on Snapchat last year and opened an application program interface (API), which made it easier for more companies to buy ads.

But that revenue growth came at a price. Snap invested heavily in new research and development to create new ad products, as well as sales teams to sell those ads. Snap also experienced a 148% increase in its cost of revenue, mostly related to hosting costs it pays to Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) for its cloud platform. (It also announced plans to spend even more with Google over the next five years.)

The result was a widening net loss. The company lost $514.6 million last year, 38% more than its $372.9 million loss in 2015.

Snap also believes free cash flow is an important financial metric since its reliance on Google's servers means it doesn't incur huge capital expenses like Facebook or Twitter , which own their own servers. Snap burned through $677.7 million last year, up from $325.8 million in 2015.

User growth and engagement

Snap focused on daily active users in its filing, noting that it's the most useful perspective of its business. Over the last year, daily average users (DAUs) increased 48%, to 158 million. The company noted it averaged 161 million DAUs in the month of December, but it will use a quarterly average when it reports results in the future.

Source: Snap S-1.

Snapchat's user growth has notably slowed over the last few quarters, and Snap expects user growth to continue slowing. Investors expecting Snapchat to reach any size resembling Facebook will be disappointed.

Snapchat's users are highly engaged, however. The company notes the average user opens the app 18 times per day and spends between 25 minutes and 30 minutes per day in the app.

Over 2.5 billion Snaps are created every day. That compares with Facebook, which says its users spend 50 minutes per day between Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger. Twitter users spend considerably less time in its app -- Comscore estimated just one minute per user last year.

That strong engagement implies that Snap has room to improve its average revenue per user. Last quarter, Snapchat's ARPU was just $1.05, $2.15 in North America. By comparison, Facebook generated $4.83 per monthly user globally and $19.81 per user in the U.S. and Canada.

Even Twitter managed to produce $2.33 per global monthly user in the fourth quarter last year. Considering Snapchat ads are generally considered high value, there's a lot of room for improvement in monetization of the existing user base.

Should you buy it?

Snap represents a very risky investment. It's going up against stiff competition from Facebook, which is unabashedly copying its main stories feature in Instagram. Its user growth is slowing as a result. Users are also heavily concentrated in a few areas, which Snap spins as a positive by saying it has a large presence in some of the largest advertising markets. For most advertising companies, however, breadth is the name of the game.

Snap's also heavily dependent on Google Cloud for its infrastructure, which will continue to cut into its gross income. Management even lists potential disruption of Google Cloud as a risk factor in the S-1 filing.

Still, its revenue growth is exciting. The $405 million it generated last year surpassed its internal expectations according to a leaked document early last year. Analysts expect revenue to reach nearly $1 billion this year, and its execution last year is an encouraging sign that it can reach those expectations. Snapchat's ad products are extremely compelling and unique (although Facebook is doing its best to copy it), and it has the young audience brand that advertisers covet.

Ultimately, an investment in Snap at its IPO is an investment in Evan Spiegel, the visionary CEO that's led numerous product innovations at Snapchat. The S-1 filing also reveals that he's done extremely well in acquiring technology and talent to support Snapchat's growth.

For investors willing to take on significant risk and who believe in the vision and abilities of Evan Spiegel as a CEO, Snap could make an interesting investment.

Two years after it was created, Desktop Metal , a 3D metal printing startup based in Burlington, Mass., is gearing up to take its first product into mass production. To do so, it’s gathered up a giant pile of venture capital from a group of noteworthy strategic investors.

The company has raised $45 million in new venture funding from the venture capital arms of Alphabet , BMW, and Lowe’s. The round values Desktop Metal at $305 million pre-money, up from its valuation of $100 million in April 2016. The company has now raised a total of $97 million. Other investors include NEA, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Lux Capital, GE Ventures, Saudi Aramco, and Stratasys, a 3D printing company.

Ric Fulop, founder of A123 Systems and former general partner at North Bridge Venture Partners, created the company alongside four MIT professors: Ely Sachs, Chris Schuh, Yet Ming Chiang, and John Hart.

Fulop says this round of funding will allow the company to enter mass production. “Our vision is to change the way people make stuff,” he says. “It’s a big vision and it requires resources to scale it up.”

The 3D printing industry is frequently knocked for not living up to its early hype. Fulop concedes that is true in when it comes to plastic 3D printing and consumer-facing printers, but notes that industrial 3D printing has thrived and metal 3D printing is especially ripe for disruption. Fulop, who has backed SolidWorks and Dyn and OnShape, sees an opportunity to modernize and lower the cost of 3D metal printers, which can cost as much as $800,000 a pop. The market for these printers is growing 50% to 60% per year, he says. General Electric has a goal of building a $1 billion 3D printing business by 2020; last year it acquired Arcam, and it paid $599 million for Concept Laser.

Desktop Metal’s new investors are potential customers. BMW could use Desktop Metal’s printers for car parts, likewise Lowe’s for in-house products. Uwe Higgen, Managing Partner of BMW i Ventures, notes that working with Desktop Metal is part of the company’s plan to adopt additive manufacturing at BMW. “Desktop Metal is shaping the way cars will be imagined, designed and manufactured,” he says,

Fulop said he was not at liberty to share the reason for Alphabet’s interest (via GV, its venture capital arm), except that it was “crazy stuff.” Andy Wheeler, General Partner at GV, noted that Desktop Metal is shaping the “dynamic evolution” that shaping the additive manufacturing industry.

“The promise of 3d printing … is making things you couldn’t make any other way,” Fulop says. “Once you are able to reduce the cost and make it more accessible, it enables you to … speed up the product cycle.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The companies are among the richest and most popular of American brands, which means they have a good deal of leverage. Yet they are also uniquely vulnerable — not only to presidential postings on Twitter and executive orders, but to the sentiments of their customers and employees, some of whom have more radical ideas in mind.

Many of the companies initially placed their bets on engagement after an upbeat meeting with the president-elect in December. That modest approach, which even the most risk-averse executive can endorse, showed its limits last week. After widespread customer defections, Travis Kalanick, the chief executive of Uber, was forced to step down from one of the administration’s advisory councils.

“People voted with their feet, and Travis listened,” said Dave McClure, who runs the 500 Startups incubator and started the Nerdz 4 Hillary group that tried to raise the $100,000. “We need to hold the other tech leaders accountable in the same way.”

Resistance, Mr. McClure said, begins at home.

“You don’t have a voice with the president if you didn’t vote for him,” he said. “But employees and customers have a voice with the tech companies. Silicon Valley should be demonstrating at the front doors of Google, Facebook and Twitter to make sure they share our values.”

Several factors are propelling Silicon Valley to the front lines of opposition to Mr. Trump. Some have been widely noted: The companies are often founded by and run by immigrants, which made the executive order on immigration offensive and a threat to their way of doing business. Tech companies frequently stress the importance of talent from other countries to their businesses.

Less remarked on has been the political homogeneity of tech workers. “It’s not like you have 60 percent of the employees on one side and 40 percent on the other,” said Ken Shotts, a professor of political economy at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. “They all have the same leanings.”

Mr. Trump does have some support in Silicon Valley, most notably the venture capitalist Peter Thiel.

Yet another factor pushing the companies is the perennially tight job market in technology. Executives cannot afford to alienate a large bloc of workers. Beyond this, there is the mythology of Silicon Valley, which holds that the work being done there is building a better future. Google’s former slogan “Don’t be evil” is the most forceful expression of this.

“If you go around making a lot of statements about your exalted role in society, at some point your employees might just make you follow through,” Mr. Shotts said.

Since the executive order was issued, the companies have struggled to keep on the same page with their employees. Microsoft, for instance, initially made relatively muted comments that mostly celebrated immigration. Twenty-four hours later, it was much blunter, calling the order “misguided and a fundamental step backwards,” and saying it would create “much collateral damage to the country’s reputation and values.”

At an all-hands meeting at the beginning of the week with the chief executive, Satya Nadella, who was born in India, Microsoft employees expressed their concern. The company did not file a formal declaration supporting Washington State’s effort to block the order the way Amazon and Expedia did, but its public comments assisted the effort, Bob Ferguson, the state attorney general, said.

The immigration battle is in Microsoft’s self-interest. Seventy-six of its employees were affected by the order, the company said.

Some in Silicon Valley have more expansive hopes for the tech companies there.

“In 2016, we saw how technology could be used to polarize ourselves to extreme levels,” said Mr. Altman of Y Combinator. “The most important thing we could do is figure out how to use technology to depolarize the nation.”

Mr. McClure of 500 Startups said it was ridiculous “for the chief executives of the valley to suggest things like hate speech and bullying speech aren’t solvable problems. Google has been solving the problem of spam for the last 10 years. No reason they can’t fix the monetization of fake news.”

Perhaps the companies just need a little push. On Sunday night, the Super Bowl was in overtime and a dreary winter rain was falling in San Francisco. That was not enough to deter more than 100 tech workers from showing up for a meeting of a new group, Tech Solidarity, that hopes to tackle some of these issues from the bottom up.

Maciej Ceglowski, the organizer, canvassed the crowd. How many of you are immigrants? How many work for big tech companies? How many work for big tech companies that attended the Trump tech summit in December? In each case, numerous hands went up. Under the rules of the meeting, participants were not identified.

It was a very geeky event. Much of it was a fund-raiser for three legal aid groups that have been working to assist travelers caught in the ban. The speaker for the Council of American-Islamic Relations was asked what she needed. She replied that she was having trouble with her customer relationship management software.

“I’ve actually been pretty obsessed with C.R.M.s lately,” said a woman in the audience, volunteering to help.

Mr. Ceglowski is a software engineer who runs the one-man start-up Pinboard. He was visiting the United States in 1981 with his mother when martial law was declared in their native Poland. He is now an American citizen.

Best-known in tech circles as a caustic critic of the large tech companies and their attitude to issues like privacy, he took on the activist mantle shortly after Mr. Trump was elected. Since then, Tech Solidarity has held rallies in Portland, Ore.; New York; Seattle; Boston; and other cities.

He talked about Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, the author of “Lean In,” which asks women, “What would you do if you weren’t afraid?” Mr. Ceglowski noted that Ms. Sandberg found time to go see Mr. Trump, but not to go to the women’s march on Washington. The crowd laughed. Ms. Sandberg has said that she had a personal obligation that kept her from the march.

When Facebook employees did their own protest last week, he pointed out, it was done in secret so no one knew about it.

“We have to protest in public,” he said. The event raised $30,000 for the legal aid groups.

“It looked like two-thirds of the room were newcomers,” Mr. Ceglowski said after the event was over. Unlike the great Silicon Valley companies, which seemed to blossom overnight, he said he knew progress here would be slow. But he was hopeful that some of the attendees were previously apolitical folk who had taken their first steps to engagement.

“I want pressure from below to counterbalance the pressure management is already feeling from above,” he said. “We have to make sure we’re pushing at least as hard as Trump is.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some, including Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , are led by CEOs who were not born in this country while over 200 companies on the Fortune 500 were started by immigrants or their children. In addition most top tech brands are global, with offices all over the world, and talent working domestically that was not born in the U.S.

At least partly because of that nearly 100 technology companies including Microsoft, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Facebook , Twitter , and many others have filed a legal brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit opposing President Donald Trump's temporary immigration ban keeping people from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the U.S. In the brief the companies argue that the ban ""inflicts significant harm on American business.""

What are they opposing?

In one of his first acts as president, Trump signed an executive order banning refugees and visa-holders from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States. That order has been stayed by a U.S. District judge and an appeals court declined to immediately reinstate the presidential order. The technology companies, many of which operate and employ workers in and from the impacted countries filed their brief to show their opposition to the president's actions.

""Immigrants make many of the Nation's greatest discoveries, and create some of the country's most innovative and iconic companies,"" the brief states. ""America has long recognized the importance of protecting ourselves against those who would do us harm. But it has done so while maintaining our fundamental commitment to welcoming immigrants -- through increased background checks and other controls on people seeking to enter our country.""

The companies that signed the brief acknowledged what Trump was, at least on the surface, trying to accomplish with the executive order.

""We share your goal of ensuring that our immigration system meets today's security needs and keeps our country safe,"" said a draft of that letter obtained by Bloomberg News . ""We are concerned, however, that your recent Executive Order will affect many visa holders who work hard here in the United States and contribute to our country's success.""

Tech requires global talent

Putting aside any political questions, the tech industry opposes Trump's immigration ban in part because it takes global talent to compete. The U.S. simply does not produce enough workers -- specifically coders who write the software that powers the products made by these companies -- to meet demand.

To fill those needs companies across the U.S. use H1B visas to receive special dispensation to hire workers who otherwise would not be able to legally work in the country. A H1B visa, according to MyVisaJobs.com , allows U.S. employers to temporarily employ foreign professionals in specialty occupations for three years, extendable to six years. ""To qualify for H1B Visa, the foreign professional must hold a bachelor's or higher degree from an accredited college or university in the specialty occupation,"" according to the site. In some cases specialized training can be substituted for a degree.

Technology companies dominate the list of employers using workers on H1B visas. Data compiled by MyVisaJobs.com shows that in 2016 Infosys held the top spot, having sponsored 25,405 visas. while Microsoft, Apple, and Alphabet were all in the top 25.

It's about more than self interest

It's easy to see the business reasons behind why these technology companies oppose Trump's immigration restrictions. Most, if not all of the companies that filed the brief would be impacted by having employees unable to travel and in some cases the executive order would impact hiring.

For at least some of these companies, however, the opposition goes beyond pure business logic. Many of these brands were either founded by immigrants or by the children of immigrants and immediate business concerns aside, they simply want a world where new immigrants to the U.S. can be free to move here and found the next Microsoft, Apple, or Alphabet.

(RTTNews.com) - About 100 companies, including tech giants like Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and Intel, have filed a legal brief against President Donald Trump's travel ban, arguing that it ""inflicts significant harm on American business, innovation, and growth.""

The amicus curiae brief was filed late Sunday in the US Court of Appeals in San Francisco. The amicus curiae brief allows someone who is not party to the case to pitch in with arguments.

Trump had banned immigration to the US from seven Muslim-majority countries. However, a federal judge in Seattle temporarily suspended Trump's order, allowing refugees and visa holders from those seven countries to enter the U.S.

Airbnb, Netflix, Snap and Uber Technologies are other technology companies that participated in the filing.

""Immigrants make many of the Nation's greatest discoveries, and create some of the country's most innovative and iconic companies,"" the brief states according to a Bloomberg report. ""America has long recognized the importance of protecting ourselves against those who would do us harm. But it has done so while maintaining our fundamental commitment to welcoming immigrantsâ€""through increased background checks and other controls on people seeking to enter our country.""

In company news, NetEase ( NTES ) American depository shares were up more than 1% late Monday following reports the Chinese technology platform has approached Alphabet's (GOOG,GOOGL) Google unit about a potential joint venture and the return of Google Play to China.

Google left China seven years ago and has periodically explored ways to bring back its applications store to the market ever since, according to an online report today by The Information, citing two people familiar with the talks. But other companies also have approached Google in the past with similar offers in the past and no deal had been struck, so there is no guarantee a deal will emerge now, the story notes.

The U.S. stock market will seek to rebound following a series of disappointing results in the early days of Donald Trump's presidency.

Several companies made headlines over the weekend, including Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ), The Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO ) and Tiffany & Co. (NYSE: TIF ).

Here's what happened:

Alphabet Inc (GOOG, GOOGL)

Alphabet has been ordered to surrender emails outside the U.S. by a federal agency.

The tech company has received an FBI warrant that U.S. Magistrate Judge Thomas Rueter signed. The judge said the move would not be considered to be a seizure.

""Though the retrieval of the electronic data by Google from its multiple data centers abroad has the potential for an invasion of privacy, the actual infringement of privacy occurs at the time of disclosure in the United States,"" Rueter said.

It is still unclear whether or not the ruling will stand as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) faced a similar situation in which a judge ruled against emails being handed over.

GOOG stock is up 3.8% year-to-date, while GOOGL shares are up 3.5% YTD.

The Coca-Cola Co (KO)

Coca-Cola released a Super Bowl ad that appears to have backfired.

The commercial was a rerun of an ad that was released in 2014, featuring ""America the Beautiful"" which was written by Katharine Lee Bates. The new version of it has the song performed in numerous languages.

In order to promote diversity, the song is performed in English, Spanish, Keres, Tagalog, Hindi, Senegalese, French and Hebrew. The video shows a diverse group of people.

While the company was attempting to send a message in support of people of all creed, many criticized it as it appeared to simply be a commercial using diversity to sell the product.

The hashtag #BoycottCoke soon followed on Twitter. Meanwhile, others supported the ad and criticized those who chose to see the commercial purely for advertising purposes.

KO shares are down 4.5% over the last six months.

Tiffany & Co. (TIF)

The Tiffany CEO has stepped down as boss.

The news came as the company announced that its upcoming earnings call will reveal disappointing results. Previous CEO Michael Kowalski will serve as the new boss on an interim basis.

Kowalski said the company will continue to focus on ""enhancing the customer experience, increasing the rate of new product introductions and innovation, maximizing marketing effectiveness, … all while efficiently managing our capital and costs.""

Lower consuming spending resulted in lower sales that hampered the company's results.

TIF shares fell 3.9% year-to-date.

As of this writing, Karl Utermohlen did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

This realization is coming from someone who has, for more than a decade, been very reliant on Google products and services in his daily life! With the share price of Alphabet falling every day since the announcement of the Q4 2016 results, before recovering only slightly in February, it gives potential investors an opportunity to digest the earnings and evaluate the investment thesis.

For a loyal user and someone who is long on the share, please forgive me for brushing off the minor miss of $0.26 when the company achieved an EPS of $9.36, which was a 8% year-on-year increase. Furthermore, the revenue side was a beat, albeit a minor one, at a 22.2% growth over the same period a year ago.

While Apple is not the best company to compare with Alphabet (which company can be used for an apples-to-apples comparison?), I have used it as a reference in generating the P/E ratio chart (below). You would see that Alphabet has been trading in a narrow P/E band since July 2014, apart from certain periods such as 2H 2015, when the P/E shot up above 35. Normalized P/E is now at 28, far from the peak in late 2015. On the contrary, Apple's P/E has been on the rise since July 2016 and is at its highest since mid-2015. Hence, from a P/E perspective, Apple might be giving potential investors the feeling that they have missed the bottom. The opposite is true for Alphabet, where for a good part of mid-2015 to Q3 2016, the P/E was higher than it presently is.

The improvement in Free Cash Flow ($1.828 billion, or 41%, higher yoy) is better represented in the Price-to-FCF chart ((below)). Despite the current share price being higher than that in end 2015, the Price-to-FCF has declined substantially to 22. Again, the comparison with Apple is to give some color (both literally and figuratively) to the graph and not to disparage Apple, which I am also long.

How Pervasive is Alphabet?

After a background on the company's recent results and notable fundamentals, I would like to get to the main motivation of this article, which is to highlight the increasing pervasiveness of Alphabet in our daily life. In addition, that pervasiveness has translated to higher advertisement penetration. Much has been said about Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) video ambitions and the resultant chase for advertisement dollars. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Snapchat (CHAT) have also thrown their hats in the ring. However, Alphabet's YouTube is still the ultimate king of videos and the unrivaled depository of user-created content by far, helped in large part by its headstart. In a leaked report from premium publisher trade body Digital Content Next (DCN), premium publishing companies generated half their syndication revenue from YouTube and the other half from all the others put together.

(Source: Business Insider)

YouTube has continually found new ways to increase advertisement placement in its streaming videos, and it's not isolated to the desktop. Google has gotten better at monetizing on the mobile front. On both platforms, you would see video ads at the beginning of videos, or several times for a long video. There could also be text links to sponsors appearing. It used to be just me watching the videos, but now my kids are also avid watchers of cartoons on YouTube. There would be two types of advertisers who target videos meant for children's consumption. One group intends to attract the children watching the videos themselves - the group would comprise toy makers, for instance. The other group, interestingly, assumes that the adults would be accompanying the kids, or at least in close enough proximity where the advertisers could attract with video ads appealing to the adults. Thus, even at those times when I wanted to rest my mind by leaving the kids to the care of YouTube, the advertisers, with Google as their accomplice, managed to capture my attention with engaging advertisements.

For you avid readers of Seeking Alpha, did you know that the advertisements placed on the left, right and bottom of every article are generated by Google? Hover your cursor over the advertisements, and you will notice it's either directing to googleadservices.com or doubleclick.net. DoubleClick, incidentally, is also a subsidiary of Google.

Thanks to the very useful flash news alert function of Seeking Alpha, I came to know the following development about the parent company of Snapchat, the popular messaging app, especially with millennials.

Snap (NYSE:SNAP), newly-filed for public offering, has engineered its technology primarily around computing, storage, bandwidth and other offerings supplied by Google, indicating a gainful arrangement for Alphabet for the coming five-year period and prospectively beyond. - Seeking Alpha News Editor Eric McCaffrey

So, if you have been using Snapchat, do note that the parent company of the app has committed $2 billion to Google Cloud over the next five years, and likely beyond that, if Snap survives that long in the first place. How many users of Snapchat actually know the level of reliance of the company on Google? Looking at it from another angle, how many investors, analysts and observers of Alphabet knew before the news broke out that Google is a beneficiary of the rise of Snapchat? While the advent and success of Snapchat have been a significant threat to Google's competitors like Facebook and its affiliated Messenger as well as WhatsApp, the threat to Google in the form of Hangouts is negligible, since it is not considered to be a major contender in the messaging space. Yet, Google's other businesses, such as Google Cloud, have been benefiting from the increasing popularity of Snapchat. Snap has also been suspected to be Google Cloud's largest customer.

Seeking Alpha News also reported on January 17 that Nest Learning Thermostats, Nest Protects and Nest Cams are installed across more than 190 countries. These Nest products are part of the offerings by Nest Labs, which was fully acquired by Google in February 2014. Outside of homes, soon a self-driving car near you might be using an autonomous-driving technology developed by Alphabet's Waymo, formerly known as the Google self-driving car project.

Other Google services that I have found myself using extensively include Gmail, Google Calendar, Google News, Google Alerts, Google Keep, Google Maps, Google Drive and, last but not least, my Android phone. A few years back, when I was running an online business, Google Adsense and Google AdWords served as two very useful tools in earning some supplementary income and low-cost targeted marketing respectively. It would be nice if readers would leave in the comments section what are the top few Google products and services they are using most extensively. I believe I am not the only person who is heavily reliant on Google every day.

Google's AI start-up DeepMind was also in the news recently for defeating top poker players, after its success over human Go masters.

Conclusion

Alphabet's wide-spreading tentacles are ensuring that its products and services are increasingly becoming more pervasive in our daily life. Consequently, there are apparently many other avenues where Alphabet, or at least Google as we know it, could insert advertisements. For instance, the most obvious place is Google's main search page (before the results), though the founders, Sergey and Larry, had sworn they would never have advertisements on that homepage. Yet, the company has already done so for its own products and services. Perhaps they should have clarified themselves then by adding ""paid"" to their statement. Another extensively used product, Gmail, has also been void of advertisement. This has been done so in the spirit of reducing clutter and improving adoption. However, I believe many long-time users of Google products and services wouldn't mind one or several placements if we have more complimentary storage space in return. Similarly, many of the other services, such as Google Alerts, Google Keep, Google Drive and Google News, are currently void of advertisements.

Individually, each of the Google services might not be the best available, but the convenience of a single login to access most of the services that I require outweighs the benefits of the leading alternatives. Hence, there remains huge potential for Alphabet to monetize its offerings through increasing ads placements.

The success of Snap would serve as Google Cloud's best testimonial, which would help the business segment to attract more customers. The proliferation of Nest products at home and in the office as well as Waymo technology in self-driving cars would mean we would come into contact with Alphabet-related physical products more often than ever. Alphabet's ""other bets,"" such as DeepMind, are areas of yet-to-be-tapped opportunities which the company could develop for revenue-generating activities. The more pervasive Alphabet has become in your life, the more reasons it is giving you to own it.

2/3/2017,0.53615083,0.054199426,802.99,806,800.37,801.49,1463448,5.63,-1.5,0,"Nearly three years have passed since Google announced it would offer an end-to-end encryption add-on for Gmail, a potentially massive shift in the privacy options of a piece of software used by more than a billion people. It still hasn’t materialized. And while Google insists its encryption plugin isn’t vaporware, the company’s latest move has left critics with the distinct impression that Gmail’s end-to-end encrypted future looks cloudy at best—if not altogether evaporated.

Last Friday, Google quietly announced that E2EMail, an extension for Chrome that would seamlessly encrypt and decrypt Gmail messages, was no longer a Google effort. Instead, the company has invited the outside developer community to adopt the project’s open-source code. Google was careful to emphasize in a blog post describing the change that it hasn’t given up work on its email encryption tool. But cryptographers and members of the privacy community see the move as confirmation that Google has officially backburnered a critical privacy and security initiative.

“The real message is that they’re not actively developing this as a Google project anymore,” says Matthew Green, a cryptographer and computer scientist at Johns Hopkin University who has closely studied tech firms’ messaging encryption products. Green notes that after close to three years, he’s happy to see any code come out of Google’s Gmail encryption work. But it’s hardly the finished email-encrypting plugin that Google had promised. “It’s definitely a bit of a disappointment, given how much hype Google generated around this project at one point, to see that they’re not pursuing this as a core feature of Gmail,” Green says.

Signs of Vapor

When Google first announced in June of 2014 that it would build an encryption tool for Gmail—then known as “End-to-End”—the move was seen as part of Google’s dramatic response to the NSA surveillance revealed by leaker Edward Snowden. But the project’s failure to emerge from a “research” phase—even as communications like Apple’s iMessage, Facebook Messenger, Facebook-owned WhatsApp, and even Viber offer end-to-end encryption to their hundreds of millions or billions of users—has disillusioned the privacy community. Commenters on the project’s Github page have asked for more than a year if Google has abandoned the encryption extension.

Google’s decision to hand E2Email over to open-source developers only cements that perception. “If I had to place a bet, I’d say it’s a telltale sign the project isn’t going anywhere,” says web security researcher Jeremiah Grossman, chief of security strategy at security firm Sentinel One. “This is a way for them to get their work out there but to absolve themselves of future obligations.”

Green, who has spoken to Google engineers about the project, says the End-to-End initiative never received the staffing necessary to push it forward. Today, he says, the total attention Google devotes to the project equates to a fraction of a single full-time staffer. “The upshot is that Google won’t be doing much more on end-to-end encryption,” Green says.

Baby Steps

Google’s own security engineers, meanwhile, say that they’ve hardly abandoned their encryption push. But making email encryption easy, argues Google privacy and security product manager Stephan Somogyi, is far harder than it might seem to the public. Unlike WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger, Gmail’s End-to-End project sought to bolt encryption onto email, an old protocol that still has to interoperate with billions of clients outside of Google’s control. And Somogyi points out that his engineers have also had to build and refine an entirely new library of crypto code in javascript, a necessary stepping stone for secure web-based encryption tools, and one widely believed to be unworkable a few years ago.

More recently, he says, the team has focused on the larger problem of key management—the tricky task of securely distributing, tracking, and looking up the unique encryption keys that allow users to decrypt encrypted messages and prove their identities. That problem has for decades dogged PGP, the encryption scheme Google bases its Gmail encryption project on. Google’s engineers are now working to solve it with a project called Key Transparency, along with researchers at Princeton, Yahoo, and Open Whisper Systems.

“The magic needs to happen in key distribution and key discovery, and we’ve been quiet for so long because we’ve been working on that hard stuff,” says Somogyi. But he makes no promises that more rigorous approach will produce actual, working encryption tools for Gmail any time soon. “Even once Key Transparency is out the door, there’s other hard stuff to work on.”

The decision to open-source the Gmail encryption plug-in project, Somogyi says, was a recognition that outside developers might want to put out a quicker fix rather than solve the underlying problems his engineers have focused on. “We’re very much playing the long game,” Somogyi says. “The reason we want to put this into the open source community is precisely because everyone cares about this so much. We don’t want everyone waiting for Google to get something done.”

Encryption Vs. Data Mining

Despite those efforts, however, Google hasn’t kept up with its competitors on end-to-end encrypted messaging. Its only serious effort in the last year was to offer opt-in end-to-end encryption in its Allo messenger, a new service with an infinitesimal fraction of the user base of existing chat platforms like Google Hangouts and Gchat.

As Gmail’s long-awaited end-to-end encryption features have failed to appear, critics have speculated about Google’s motives. Does it want to avoid the clashes with the US government that WhatsApp and Apple faced down when their encryption has stymied law enforcement? Or does a company so focused on big data analysis not want to relinquish its ability to mine emails in the service of highly targeted ads and services? The Allo voice assistant, for instance, doesn’t function when users have encryption enabled. The entire notion of end-to-end encryption, after all, is that no one but the people communicating can decrypt messages, not even the service hosting those communications.

Google’s Somogyi argues that advertising doesn’t figure into his team’s encryption decisions. But he concedes that for services like Gmail’s spam and malware filtering, end-to-end encryption makes data mining far more difficult. He describes the balance Google seeks diplomatically: “Where we can provide added value to the user by having machine-based systems look at the data, we’re absolutely going to do that,” Somogyi said. “At every opportunity that we have to protect users’ data from unauthorized access we absolutely, vigorously pursue that.”

Ideally, the tradeoffs between services that mine someone’s communications and their privacy should be left to the users themselves, says Somogyi. “What’s important ultimately is that the user has a choice,” he says.

That choice, for Gmail users, has been a long time coming. Until the E2Email project comes to fruition—if it ever does—the existing decision for users is starker: Share your secrets over Gmail, or send them over one of the many end-to-end encrypted messaging services that’s far better engineered to protect them.

A closer look, however, reveals a very specific motivation. And it could spell trouble for NVIDIA.

NVIDIA GPU is the go-to chip to train AI systems -- for now. Image source: NVIDIA.

Intel has seen the market for its CPU chips shrink along with the worldwide shipment of personal computers, which fell an estimated 6% in 2016, the fifth consecutive year of declines. Competitor NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) , meanwhile, has seen the market explode for its graphic processing units (GPU), along with its stock price, which tripled in 2016.

Though once used solely to render graphics in video games, NVIDIA's GPUs have become the go-to chip for training neural networks due to the massive parallel processing capability. According to a Financial Times article in December, NVIDIA ""is widely credited with having developed the best chips for training the artificial neural networks"". The use of NVIDIA GPUs by data centers -- many training AI systems -- helped revenue nearly triple in the most recent quarter, to $240 million from just $82 million in the prior year. Intel dominates the non-AI data center market, selling nearly 99% of server chips used, and it now has its sights on the nascent AI market as well.

What is Intel doing?

Late last year, Intel announced that it would release a server chip specifically designed for AI applications -- the Xeon Phi, aka Knights Mill. It indicated this processor would run 2.3 times faster than NVIDIA's GPUs when used for deep learning. NVIDIA countered, saying Intel deliberately used outdated benchmarks and older versions of its products in the comparison. It claims that had Intel used the updated benchmark, NVIDIA's offering is 30% faster, and that its latest processor is 90% faster.

Intel wants to ""unleash the next wave"" in artificial intelligence. Image source: Intel.

Intel's recent acquisition pushes it deeper into this market. Nervana Systems took a different approach in its AI research. It has created an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for its AI research called the Nervana Engine. Certain elements in a GPU needed for graphics processing are not necessary in an AI application. By stripping out unnecessary elements and reengineering the memory, Nervana claims it can achieve 10 times increases in the computing power currently available on GPUs. In an article from October 2015, Barron's [subscription required] explained:

Their chip has thousands of little logic engines sitting next to pools of memory, with a plethora of connections between them. They claim the chip can perform in a fraction of the time an image-recognition task that would take an Intel server chip 2,000 hours, or an Nvidia GPU, 33 hours. The key is that they are designing for specific algorithms, so the chip's design is more efficient than a general-purpose chip like Intel's or NVIDIA's.

Nervana Engine ASIC chips are designed to accelerate AI system training. Image source: Nervana Systems.

Intel will be integrating the new technology into its existing chips in early 2017, so expect new offerings that will directly challenge NVIDIA's GPUs in the AI space. Intel also claims that by 2020, it will be able to train AI systems 100 times faster than with today's technology, though some have deemed those goals very aggressive.

It's not the only one

And Intel isn't the only one claiming improvements beyond what GPUs currently accomplish. Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google has been conducting research in the field of AI for over five years . It announced it has a Tensor Processing Unit -- which is also an ASIC -- capable of delivering performance that is 10 times faster than any GPU running today, and that it has been running TPUs in its data centers for more than a year. They were also used in the AI system Alpha Go, which recently made headlines by defeating many top ranked Go players . This provides a degree of confirmation of Nervana's claims regarding the potential of such custom circuits.

NVIDIA sees AI as a billion-dollar opportunity, though data center revenue amounted to only $240 million in its most recent quarter. Intel's revenue from data centers, meanwhile, amounted to $4.7 billion in its most recent quarter. This illustrates that while gains in the market would barely move the needle for Intel, they could be a big mover for NVIDIA. While GPUs currently hold a commanding lead in the training of AI systems, that could change quickly if the technological advances claimed by Intel came to fruition.

However, experts are increasingly warning about overvalued issues and market bubbles — a theme that likely won’t fade this week.

A number of tech stocks have stolen the spotlight heading into Monday’s trade. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and BlackBerry Ltd (NASDAQ: BBRY ) made waves over the weekend, while Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ) was getting batted around after a Monday morning headline.

Here’s what you need to know going into today’s trade:

Tesla Inc (TSLA)

TSLA stock is down Monday after the company’s shares were knocked down a peg by the analyst community.

Goldman Sachs downgraded Tesla shares on Monday morning, dragging the company down from “Neutral” to “Sell.”

Analyst David Tamberrino says:

“While we believe Tesla currently has a lead relative to OEM peers with respect to vehicle technology adoption, electric vehicle architecture, and (potentially) battery scale, our concerns are more near-term oriented with respect to operational execution on the Model 3 launch, an unproven solar business, and cash needs. Ultimately we see a delayed launch (pushing volume growth out and to the right) and FCF burn rate (necessitating a capital raise before 4Q17) to weigh on TSLA’s shares.”

Tamberrino also worries that the SolarCity acquisition “increased the risk profile of Tesla amidst a business model transition,” and lowered the price target slightly from $190 to $185.

Tesla is coming off a fourth-quarter earnings report during which it was announced that CFO Jason Wheeler would be exiting in April — a surprising move that has drawn a little scrutiny from the investment community.

TSLA shares are off more than 2% this morning.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL)

Alphabet announced that one of its artificial intelligence products will be available in more of the company’s products moving forward.

Google Assistant will now be available in the company’s tablets, smartphones, computers and smartwatches for anyone using Android 6.0 Marshmallow or higher. It can even be used on smart TV systems such as Nvidia Shield TV and AI car systems.

Google Assistant is Alphabet’s virtual assistant app that competes with the likes of Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Siri and Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Alexa. You can use GA for a number of purposes, from general search to checking the weather to playing music.

The annual ranking from Brand Finance says Google's ( googl ) monetary value increased to $109.5 billion last year, representing a 24% increase overall. By contrast, Apple's ( aapl ) monetary value fell from $145.9 billion in the previous year to $107.1 billion, according to the study. The decrease allowed Google to snag the top spot by about $2.4 billion.

The news of its No.2 spot comes as ""Apple has failed to maintain its technological advantage and has repeatedly disillusioned its advocates with tweaks when material changes were expected,"" the study's authors wrote, who further explained that the tech-giant has ""over-exploited the goodwill"" of its customers, namely because of its failure to generate significant revenues from products like the Apple Watch, and its inability to ""demonstrate that genuinely innovative technologies desired by consumers are in the pipeline.""

As for Google, the company ""remains largely unchallenged in its core search business, which is the mainstay of its advertising income,” Brand Finance wrote in the report. Though Google has largely benefited from increased revenues (parent company Alphabet recently reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter revenue ) its brand strength score is also a factor in its success. According to the study, Google's brand strength score was up by two points, indicating ""underlying brand equity."" In other words, the better the brand equity is for a tech business, the more likely it is to retain customers, or ""even command a price premium that its products and services might not be worth,"" Brand Finance reports.

Out of the 500 brands analyzed, Amazon ( amzn ) was deemed third most valuable, at $106.4 billion. Snagging the No. 4 spot was AT&T at $87 billion, which was followed by No.5 Microsoft at $76.3 billion and No.6 Samsung at $66.2 billion. Verizon was No. 7 at $65.9 billion. Walmart , Facebook, and ICBC snagged the last three spots in the top ten, at $62.2 billion, $61.9 billion, and $47.8 billion, respectively.

2/2/2017,0.399086722,0.06888787,793.8,802.7,792,798.53,1532138,10.7,4.73,1,"“I went from a very average life to a broken life,” Sybrina Fulton told a crowd at Google’s offices in downtown San Francisco last November. After George Zimmerman shot her son, Trayvon Martin, in Florida in 2012, and was later acquitted of second-degree murder, Fulton transformed from a mother to an activist. Still, she said, she objects to people calling her strong. Speaking out was a matter of necessity.

“I didn’t want to live the rest of my life bitter, because that would have taken two lives instead of just one,” she said, name checking Beyoncé’s Lemonade, in which she makes a brief cameo. She said her son’s death forced her to speak out because “this country just did not see how broken it was.” Evidence of that brokenness has been piling up since Martin’s death. It’s there in the frequent shootings of black men and boys by police, and in the white supremacists hailing Donald Trump after he was elected to the presidency after a campaign marked by bigotry. It’s also there in the demographics of Google’s employee population: As at most tech companies, there are few black or Latino workers, especially among engineers. This explains why Fulton had been invited to speak as part of a series of discussions on race. Google—along with nearly every other tech company, from giants to startups—is struggling to get past that brokenness to a place where the workforce better reflects the audiences it serves. When the company released its first diversity report in 2014, it essentially forced other tech companies to do the same, and confirmed longstanding suspicions about the industry’s makeup. But while the concept of annual diversity reports suggests that Silicon Valley wants to hold itself accountable for improving its dismal diversity figures, so far, not a lot has changed. After spending two years and $265 million on the effort, Google’s employee population was only 2% black in 2016, the same percentage as it was in 2014. Fifty-nine percent of Googlers are white, 32% are Asian, 3% are Hispanic, and 3% identified as a mix of two or more ethnicities. A roundup of diversity reports, gathered by The Hacker Life in March, finds similar numbers at many tech companies. This data reflects the gender composition of Google’s global technical workforce and the race and ethnicity composition of Google’s U.S. workforce as of January 1, 2016. For more stats, visit google.com/diversity. In the U.S., African-Americans and Hispanics make up 26% of the population over the age of 21, Knatokie Ford, the former senior policy adviser for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, recently told Essence. But they make up only 11% of the workforce in industries related to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. “To see something significant where we’re actually hitting a market supply, you know, of 10% or something like that of hispanic and black Googlers, that’s going to take several years,” Nancy Lee, the company’s former diversity chief, told the PBS NewsHour in July. In mid-December, Google’s efforts appeared to hit another snag after TechCrunch reported that Lee was retiring from the company. The company would not comment on her decision to leave, on who might replace her, or how its diversity and inclusion programs could shift in her absence. Lee could not be reached for comment directly.

Last month, the company’s employment data entered the spotlight again after the U.S. Department of Labor announced it was suing Google over its failure to provide the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) with compensation information related to its equal opportunity program. “Like other federal contractors, Google has a legal obligation to provide relevant information requested in the course of a routine compliance evaluation,” OFCCP Acting Director Thomas M. Dowd said in a statement. “Despite many opportunities to produce this information voluntarily, Google has refused to do so.” In response, Google spokespeople have said the request for that information was too broad and risked divulging confidential employee information. “We’re very committed to our affirmative action obligations and to improving the diversity of our workforce, and have been very vocal about the importance of these issues,” Google told the Society for Human Resource Management. The company has invested millions in a program focused on reducing unconscious bias in its employees, tweaked its policies to make pay more equitable, and also sought to address the so-called “pipeline” problem, the argument that there aren’t enough minority engineers to choose from, by improving its recruiting efforts. In recent years, Google has worked closely with historically black colleges in order to identify and recruit engineering talent. According to Essence, more than 400 recruits from that program are still at Google. The Google Photos manager admitted that a more diverse team would have noticed problems earlier in the process. Google is also a hefty supporter of Black Girls Code, an organization that exposes girls of color to computer science and technology, and last year it set up shop in Oakland’s predominantly black Fruitvale neighborhood in an effort to provide technology training to locals. A second site is slated to open in Harlem, New York, this year. Google spent $115 million on diversity initiatives in 2014 and $150 million in 2015, according to USA Today. However, spokesman Ty Sheppard said it’s not divulging how much the company invested in those programs in 2016, or how much it plans to lay out in 2017. But even getting diverse candidates through the door often isn’t enough. At Facebook, for instance, an experiment offered recruiters “double points” if they found a candidate that was a “diversity hire.” However, those candidates ran into trouble as a committee of high-ranking engineers often vetoed them. The effect of unconscious bias may even appear in the company’s search results. Google’s Photos app famously tagged two black people as gorillas, and image searches for common terms, such as “man” or “woman” (or, puzzlingly, “beautiful dreadlocks”) mostly produce pictures of white people. When Google was called out for returning criminal mugshots when people searched for images of black teenagers, Google claimed that its search algorithms are based on the availability and frequency of online data, but that the results don’t reflect the company’s own beliefs. Still, as Bradley Horowitz, the manager who led Google Photos at the time of the gorilla incident, admitted recently, according to TechCrunch, a more diverse team would have noticed the problems earlier in the process. (The company has recently funded research into fighting bias in machine learning.)

Ethnic Diversity In Tech Positions for 2016: Nota bene: the U.S.A. row is based on “computer and mathematical operations” data row from the BLS report. Amazon does not separate tech and non-tech employees. Chart is by Nick Heer, Diversity of Tech Companies by the Numbers: 2016 Edition by PIXELENVY This all helps to explain what has brought activists like Fulton to Google’s campuses, in an effort to nudge audiences to behave more inclusively. “We have to get to that space where it does not matter—if it’s your 6-year-old brother or or your 6-year-old son—the color of their skin does not matter. Because I can sit here right now before you, and there are a lot of things I could take off . . . but I cannot remove the color of my skin. Nor do I want to, because it’s who I am,” she said. Decoding And Upgrading Valeisha Butterfield Jones, who was hired as Google’s head of black community engagement in January 2016, is reluctant to predict how long it might take to create significant diversity among Google’s employees, who now number 65,000. She admits, “We have a lot of work to do.” Sheppard, the Google spokesman, noted that with so many employees, even a small increase in the percentage of black employees translates to hundreds of workers. “While the percentage doesn’t appear to change, there is progress happening,” he says. Valeisha Butterfield Jones Jones was a youth organizer for Obama for America before joining Google. She’s looking at a number of ways to bring more black and Latino workers to Google, and to change the tech titan’s internal culture surrounding race. As part of a broader project called Race At Google, she helped launch a speaker series this year called Decoding Race, with the assistance of Michael Skolnik, the well-connected political director for the media mogul Russell Simmons. Jones so far has brought activist DeRay McKesson to speak to Googlers and hosted Van Jones as the star of a talk entitled, “Can Computers Be Racist?” Fulton’s talk was another in the series; she spoke alongside comedian Cristela Alonzo, Google’s in-house racial equitect Myosha McAfee, journalist and undocumented immigrant Jose Antonio Vargas, and moderator Michaela Angela Davis. More than 3,000 Google employees have come out for the Decoding Race series so far, and many more have watched via Google’s internal live-streaming systems. (The discussion is also available on YouTube.) At least 10 more talks are planned over the next year at Google sites around the country, Jones says. “Most of the talks have had a majority of white men in the audience,” she says. “That was so inspiring for me, to see that there was an appetite to come in and better understand the communities they work and live with.” “Unconscious bias training is a way to say, ‘We’re working on it,’ but since it’s not required . . . the people who really need it aren’t going.” At least one black former Google engineer isn’t as inspired. Erica Joy Baker left her position as a site reliability engineer in May 2015 after almost 10 years with Google, largely because she was fed up with the company’s failure to address a culture of casual racism. After leaving, Baker cofounded Project Include, an organization designed to help tech companies achieve real diversity, with former interim Reddit CEO Ellen Pao. She’s also an engineer at Slack, which she says is doing its own work around diversity and inclusion. At a recent panel discussion, Leslie Miley, Slack’s director of engineering, urged Google and other tech companies to use blind assessments when looking for new recruits, something Slack already does.

Baker was still at Google when the company launched its unconscious bias program, which aims to train folks to recognize when they’re operating from places of unrecognized racism or sexism—including when interacting with coworkers or potentially hiring new ones. Last summer, the company reported that all new Googlers take the workshop as part of their orientation, and that over 65% of Googlers have participated in the workshops so far. “Unconscious bias training is a way to say, ‘We’re working on it,’ but since it’s not required, the only people who show up are the people who are already thinking about and working on those biases, and the people who really need it aren’t going,” Baker says. She suspects the Decoding Race talks will appeal to a similar audience. “You Have to Be Prepared to Fire People” Baker experienced a gauntlet of casual and overt racism at Google. During her first years at the company, in the mid-2000s, she reported a white male colleague for making racist and sexist remarks, and was told she could either put up with it or move from the office in Atlanta to another one in New York, she says. She chose New York, then later transferred to Google’s Mountain View, California, office. Baker’s coworkers regularly mistook her for a non-engineer because of her race. Some assumed she was one of Google’s security officers, despite the fact that security personnel wear specific uniforms, while others thought she was her office mate’s personal assistant. Those kinds of biases were baked into Google’s beginnings, she says. When Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded Google 18 years ago, they wanted to “re-create grad life at Stanford at Google,” Baker says. They hired mostly white and Asian men, brought in ping-pong tables and pool tables, and kept the alcohol flowing. But nobody ever thought about how that culture might exclude others, she says. Baker regularly witnessed discussions in which people talked about how, for example, they thought black people were less intelligent—or more prone to violence—than white people. “That sort of thing was permitted because there weren’t enough black people to speak out against it,” Baker says. Can Artificial Intelligence Wipe Unconscious Bias From Your Workday?

There’s a plethora of tech meant to make recruiting fairer. Joonko wants to help ordinary workers pinpoint bias throughout the workday. No amount of unconscious bias trainings or speaker events are likely to upend such behavior, say workplace consultants. For diversity and inclusion initiatives to really work, a company has to embrace them at every level—and show real accountability, says Y-Vonne Hutchinson, founder of ReadySet, a diversity consulting firm in Oakland.

“You need to bring in people who value diversity. Don’t just bring a person of color into a place that’s a little bit hostile and not bring in people who support diversity,” says Hutchinson, who’s also a member of Project Include. “You have to be prepared to make tough decisions. You have to be prepared to fire people.” Asked if she ever saw anyone at Google get fired for casual or even overt racism, Baker exhaled with a bitter laugh. “No. Absolutely not,” she says. “They get to write it off as a different political opinion. It sends the message that someone can be blatantly racist, and this is a culture that tolerates it.” Sheppard disagrees, saying that Page and Brin “have been very committed to diversity” at Google. Acts of racism among employees are grounds for termination, and Google has fired employees for behaving in racist ways, he says. Beyond making employees feel safe and respected, there are solid business reasons for creating a diverse workforce, says Hutchinson: Heterogeneous companies make better products, while homogenous companies make worse ones. “As tech companies become more risk-averse, being able to derive revenue early on is going to become very important,” he says. “Ninety-two percent of startups fail in the first year—50% from a poor product fit.” Rhoma Young, a human resources expert and member of the Association of Workplace Investigators, says she used to support diversity programs in corporations. Now she’s more reluctant to suggest them, unless a company is very committed to creating real cultural change in how employees treat each other from management on down. “Unless they are willing to do it realistically and stand behind it, it’s going to become a joke and a sham. It’s going to give a mixed message,” Young says. Without that commitment, “it’s not worth the resources to raise an expectation level [about diversity] that’s not realistic.” What About Employee Retention? In addition to the Decoding Race series, Jones is beginning to work on building bridges between Google and communities of color. In early December, she facilitated a mixer in New York City where more than 300 black and Latino professionals mingled with Google employees and recruiters in an effort to bring more of those professionals through Google’s doors. Jones says she’s planning more such events in 2017, and also looking at how to retain black and Latino employees once they’re hired.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a general rule, the market is pretty good about learning from its mistakes. After all, there is nothing like a hefty loss to teach traders what not to do.

That is a simple fact that must be borne in mind when looking for patterns in pricing; if the pattern involves a reaction to news that was ultimately proven wrong, it is unlikely to repeat very often, and the few opportunities when it does should be grabbed with both hands.

That is what makes Google parent company Alphabet (GOOG: GOOGL) look like such a good buy after its reaction to Q4 earnings.

As you can see from the chart below, prior to last week’s earnings report Google (I’m sorry but I just can’t bring myself to call the company “Alphabet”) had dropped sharply on earnings misses contained in two of the previous three releases, in April and October.

On both of those occasions, though, the big drop in price was, with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, an opportunity to buy the stock at a discount. There are different circumstances this time around, of course, but the dynamic that has made negative reactions to earnings in the past opportunities is still in place, so the end result is likely to be the same.

The biggest problems with the Q4 results as far as traders were concerned, it seems, were that cost per click was down, and operating costs had risen to the point where earnings per Class A share (EPS) of $9.36 fell short of the Street’s estimates of around $9.64. Still, revenues of $26.06 billion beat the estimated $25.26 billion.

There was also a concern lurking in the background regarding Google taking on both Amazon (AMZN)’s Echo and Apple (AAPL)’s iPhone with recent hardware launches. Google said that they were pleased with the reaction to both Google Home and the Pixel phone without going into specifics, but doubts about the wisdom of the strategy persist.

I actually believe that Google has a chance of limited success in each case. The Pixel will be the most uphill struggle as the iPhone’s dominance of the mobile phone market is well established. Most estimates of sales of the phone so far are around 1 million, which hardly puts a dent in the iPhone, but may prove to be enough of a base to make the Pixel profitable as a niche product.

Home has an easier, more logical path to success as Google is the natural choice of those looking for what is, essentially, a free-standing search engine.

Ultimately, though, neither Home nor Pixel is going to be the driver of the recovery in the stock price that history suggests will come soon.

First, the increase in operating costs that Google reported seems, on a breakdown of the numbers, to be the result of investment in the core business. Losses in what the company calls “Other Bets,” things like “Nest” and self driving cars, were actually reduced somewhat in the fourth quarter, but there was significant progress on the autonomous vehicle front.

The possibilities of that field are endless and Google, along with Tesla (TSLA) and Apple, are generally seen as the leaders in driverless car research and technology.

The other issue, of falling cost per click (CPC), is also not what it seems on the surface. It reflects a continuing move to mobile that results in that metric falling, but the volume of clicks increasing. The same issue was, in part, responsible for the April and October drops in GOOG after earnings, and the chart tells the story of how long it was until investors realized that volume more than offset falling CPC.

Looking at Google’s results and the market reaction to them, I get a sense of déjà vu. We have actually been here before, twice, and each time the drop in GOOG gave investors a chance to buy cheaply. It seems that in this case the market is still learning from its mistake and over time the outcome here is most likely to be the same.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The social media giant's revenues increased 51% year on year (y-o-y) to over $8.8 billion, beating Reuters' compiled consensus estimates of $8.5 billion. This was driven by a significant rise in advertising revenues, which increased 53% y-o-y to over $8.6 billion. However, this was slightly offset by a decline in Payments & Other Fees collected in the quarter, which was impacted due to a reduction in games played on the Facebook platform on PCs. In terms of the bottom line, the company's adjusted net income grew by a whopping 78% y-o-y to $1.41 per share, easily beating consensus estimates of $1.31 per share.



Robust Mobile Advertising Revenue Growth

Advertising revenue, Facebook's primary source of revenue, grew 53% to over $8.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016 driven by growth in mobile ad revenues across geographies. Mobile ad revenues contributed 84% of total advertising revenues, up from 80% in the same period last year. Mobile ad revenues grew both because of an increase in frequency of ads shown in News Feed and the price per ad. The average price per ad increased 3% and total ad impressions rose 49% in Q4 2016 over the same period last year.

Another important aspect of Facebook's advertising revenue growth was its growth in average revenue per user (ARPU), especially in North America. ARPU in North America grew at an impressive 45% y-o-y to almost $20 per quarter, driving the company wide ARPU up by 29% to $4.83 per quarter.

Facebook management reiterated that advertising growth is likely to come down meaningfully in 2017 because the company is going to focus on keeping ad impressions at sustainable levels. Therefore, the next wave of ad revenue growth is expected to come from price per ad and subscriber growth. Also, management stated that hiring expenses and investments in R&D, sales and marketing are expected to rise in 2017.

Impressive Free Cash Flow Growth

One of the impressive aspects of Facebook's business model is its ability to consistently increase free cash flows. Despite a 83% increase in capital investments in Q4 2016 over the same period in 2015, Facebook's free cash flows increased 36% y-o-y in the quarter. This should help the company continue to make investments into newer areas such as its internet.org venture, virtual reality, augmented reality and artificial intelligence.

User Base Continues To Grow

In terms of engagement metrics, there was 51% y-o-y growth in Facebook's monthly active users (MAUs) to 1.86 billion. To put this in perspective, this means that over 25% of the world's population logs in to Facebook on a monthly basis. This ratio varies from about 64% in the U.S. and Canada to 15% in the Asia-Pacific region. Facebook's monthly active user base remained strong across all platforms, including Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger.

At the end of December 2016, the number of MAUs on Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger were 600 million, 1.2 billion and 1+ billion, respectively. With respect to Messenger, management stated in the earnings call that 400 million users now use the voice and video chat on Messenger every month. The company reiterated the growing importance of video in content consumption on the Facebook platform, which should also help its advertising revenue in the long term. We expect that Facebook will continue to account for a larger share of the rapidly growing digital ad market going forward, as its product offerings have become highly popular with businesses of all sizes. Facebook's long-term outlook looks strong on the back of strong monetization opportunities on its platforms across geographies as well as inroads into newer areas such as VR.

The Japanese Supreme Court today dismissed a case against the U.S. company seeking the removal of allegedly defamatory results from its search engine, including one case of a man who sought to remove details of his arrest on child prostitution charges, Japan Times reported.

The man took libel action against Google on the grounds of infringement of privacy, but the court decided that the result should remain online since it is a matter of public interest. The case didn’t take issue with articles of the arrest but, instead, that excerpts that could show in a Google search result.

While there are similarities with Europe’s “right to be forgotten” ruling, the legal cases are not the same. The Europe’s case, the issues center around the freedom of individuals, but, in Japan, the suits against Google came a small number of plaintiffs that included both businesses and individuals.

“We’re pleased that with these latest rulings, the Supreme Court has unanimously recognized, based on existing privacy and defamation laws, that any decision to delete information from search results should prioritize the public’s right to information,” Google told TechCrunch in a statement.

The U.S. firm previously argued against the removals, stating that they did not violate its terms and served an important purpose for the public.

“While we provide tools that allow business owners to respond to reviews, and we take down posts that violate our policies, we believe online reviews, positive and negative, are a critical tool for people to give and read direct feedback about businesses,” it said in 2015.

2/1/2017,0.416988636,0.145075758,799.68,801.19,791.19,795.7,2029744,10,-3.98,0,"California’s Department of Motor Vehicles released its annual autonomous vehicle disengagement report today, in which all the companies that are actively testing self-driving cars on public roads in the Golden State disclose the number of times that human drivers were forced to take control of their driverless vehicles. The biggest news to come out of this report is from Waymo, Google’s new self-driving car company, which reported a huge drop in disengagements in 2016 despite an almost equally huge increase in the number of miles driven.

In other words, Waymo’s self-driving cars are failing at a much lower rate, even as they are driving a whole lot more miles. The company says that since 2015, its rate of safety-related disengages has fallen from 0.8 per thousand miles to 0.2 per thousand miles in 2016. So while Waymo increased its driving by 50 percent in the state — racking up a total of 635,868 miles — the company’s total number of reportable disengages fell from 341 in 2015 to 124.

“This four-fold improvement reflects the significant work we’ve been doing to make our software and hardware more capable and mature,” Dmitri Dolgov, head of self-driving technology for Waymo, wrote in a blog post. “And because we’re creating a self-driving car that can take you from door to door, almost all our time has been spent on complex urban or suburban streets. This has given us valuable experience sharing the road safely with pedestrians and cyclists, and practicing advanced maneuvers such as making unprotected left turns and traversing multi-lane intersections.”

The majority of Waymo’s disengagements were the result of “software glitches,” the company says. “Unwanted maneuvers,” “perception discrepancies,” and “recklessly behaving road user” also accounted for dozens of disengagements. There were no reports of crashes or accidents.

California requires companies that want to test autonomous vehicles on the roads to register for an autonomous driving permit. As part of this program, companies are also required to report their disengagement rates to the DMV, which then makes those numbers public. This requirement was likely a factor in Uber’s refusal to obtain an autonomous permit, resulting in the DMV revoking the ride-hail company’s vehicle registration for its self-driving cars.

Waymo is miles ahead of its competitors in public testing. While a host of car and tech companies have been testing for many years privately, Waymo still has the edge on real-world experience. Also, the news of the improvements in Waymo’s self-driving technology comes just as the company plans to deploy its fleet of autonomous Chrysler Pacifica minivans, which it first debuted at the Detroit auto show last month. The vans will hit the road in Mountain View, CA, and Phoenix, AZ, sometime in the next few days.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The company's Boston Dynamics unit recently showed off a new robot called Handle. Resembling a human with a torso, two arms and legs, Handle's feet have been replaced by wheels.

At a recent event, Boston Dynamics teased the robot, which will be able to carry objects and perform other tasks. A video of Handle, taken by a guest at the debut, later surfaced on YouTube. However, Boston Dynamics requested certain portions to be blurred out.

The clip highlighted the robot's impressive balance, shown as it rolled down a grassy hill and over a curb. Handle's wheels make it more efficient to move than a robot with legs.

Traditionally, the division has made robots that walk on two or four legs. Its videos often go viral.

""This is the debut presentation of what I think will be a nightmare inducing robot if you're anything like me,"" Boston Dynamics CEO Marc Raibert told the crowd, drawing laughter. While the appearance of Handle might be alarming to some, it's an indication of how robots could look and operate in the future.

Boston Dynamics has kept a low profile in the last year. Google has described the Boston Dynamics' team as being ""heads down,"" rather than speaking about projects publicly.

In March 2016, Google reportedly put it up for sale as a part of an effort to control costs. At the time, Boston Dynamics wasn't expected to deliver a marketable product in the near future. It's unclear if that's changed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ahead of earnings for Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ), which will come out at the end of trading on Wednesday, investors are certainly upbeat. And why not? FB stock has been a pretty good bet.

Source: Shutterstock

But could things be different this time around? Maybe the enthusiasm for Facebook stock is too carried away?

Well, it is important to note that the valuation is still reasonable. The forward price-to-earnings ratio on FB stock is at about 25X. This compares to roughly 20X for both Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ). And these companies are not growing at anywhere near the pace of Facebook.

What's more, it seems like Facebook earnings should do fine in Q4. Revenues are expected to jump by 46% to $8.5 billion and adjusted EPS are forecasted to come to $1.31, up from 79 cents during the same period a year ago. Keep in mind that - for the past five quarters - the company has beat the Street on both the top and bottom lines.

FB Stock Still Faces Several Risks

But the real potential issue for Facebook stock is any disappointing commentary on the future growth trends. Interestingly enough, on the Q3 earnings call, the company's CFO had this ominous thing to say : ""We continue to expect that revenue growth rates will decline in Q4 as we lap a strong fourth quarter in 2015. We also continue to expect that our total payments and other fees revenue in Q4 will be lower than it was in the fourth quarter of last year.""

No doubt, this should not be a surprise. As FB gets much larger, it will increasingly get more difficult to churn out strong revenue numbers. It's the curse of the so-called ""law of large numbers.""

Let's face it, Facebook already has a massive user base. In the most recent quarter, the number of monthly active users hit 1.79 billion, up 16% on a year-over-year basis. There were also a stunning 1.2 billion daily users.

But going forward, what will the sources of new users be? It's hard to tell. But initiatives from FB show concerns. After all, the company has been working hard to provide internet access to developing nations.

And don't forget about China. According to a report from the Wall Street Journal , it appears that Facebook has made little progress. Instead, rivals like Weibo Corp(ADR) (NASDAQ: WB ) and Tencent (OTCMKTS: TCEHY ) have been capitalizing on the opportunity.

At the same time, other problems could affect FB stock. For example, during the last few months, there have been various embarrassing stories about how the company has inflated certain metrics. Might this cause some pushback from advertisers?

Then there is the ""fake news"" controversy. Granted, the company has taken actions to improve the publishing of news, such as with a focus on credible sources. But this could result in lower clicks and views, which would slow down the revenue momentum for Facebook stock.

Something else that could dampen some of the enthusiasm for FB stock: the upcoming Snapchat IPO, which should hit the markets within the next couple of months. Of course, there will be tremendous buzz and excitement. There will also be the inevitable comparisons to FB. In other words, investors may look at Snapchat as an alternative to Facebook stock when seeking the next growth play.

Overall, Wednesday's earnings announcement will definitely be important. And if there are signs of deceleration on the top-line, FB stock could be vulnerable, especially since it has already pulled off a nice run for the year.

Innovation Leaders

Curiously, all eight GSV-highlighted companies have dedicated efforts in the areas of artificial intelligence, big data and cloud services, making these three the Holy Grail of innovation.

The first two come as no surprise, as data gathering and analysis are critical to predicting behavior, enabling companies to target consumers accordingly. Web services, which is now the fastest-growing segment for Amazon, is less obvious but nonetheless a clear indicator these innovators want to get bigger by serving as the backbone for other companies.

This is key, and since Google already commands 49% of the global online advertising market according to Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser, I'll bet on GOOGL.

Moonshot

Much of Google's innovative efforts happen at its off-site research center called Google X, aka the Moonshot Factory. It's run by a futurist named Astro Teller, and I highly recommend his TED Talk explaining how Google X approaches innovation:

Identify a problem affecting millions of people. Find or propose a radical solution for solving that problem. Move full speed ahead if there's reason to believe technology for such a radical solution could actually be built.

He says Google X people spend most of their time ""breaking things and trying to prove they're wrong"" but believes that's their secret … what makes Googlers different. By ""killing"" more projects than they approve, their success rate rises. Alphabet spent $13.8 billion last year on research and development - the second highest number of any company in the world behind Amazon, and second highest as a percentage of sales among the eight innovation leaders.

R&D as % of Revenue

Alphabet invests a staggering amount of money to fund R&D, both because it can and because it has to. With three times more online advertising than its next closest competitor, GOOGL is a cash cow.

By the same token, it has significant overlap with all seven competitors in the most obvious categories - like robotics and AI- and each of these companies is hungry to dominate.

There's no letting up in this crowd. Innovate or die.

What's GOOGL Stock Worth?

Ultimately, the question is value: What do we pay?

I like to compare the growth we're getting (earnings) with the price we're paying (price-to-earnings, or P/E). This is called a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG), and it's an intuitive way to compare apples to apples.

Using 2017 consensus estimates tracked by Bloomberg, GOOGL stock is tucked right in the middle of the pack. Its PEG ratio is 1.08. PEGs below 1 are cheap, and PEGs approaching 2 are expensive.

PEG ratios are revealing.

First of all, no one should buy Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ). It's neither a growth stock nor a value play.

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE: BABA ) is a tad expensive, but not excessively so, especially since many consider it the Chinese consumer trading vehicle.

Amazon is attractive, so are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ), both of which I have written up as longs and currently own.

Samsung (OTCMKTS:SSNLF), I admit is a mystery. It's so cheap. I can only surmise its limited German and S. Korean listings deter U.S. investors, as does the $1,700 stock price. It needs to split at least 10-to-1.

The Trade

Sell the GOOGL April $800 puts at $20 to initiate a long-biased position.

If the stock pulls back and trades through the $800 strike price, I'm assigned shares and become a buyer. If Google continues making new highs, I pocket the premium. I am content either way. Google's chart indicates initial technical support around $780, and significant long-term support $700-$725.

The reason I'm selling puts rather than buying the stock is because GOOGL stock has recently risen to a new all-time high. I know new highs tend to beget new highs (momentum traders buy strength), but I'm a value buyer at heart.

That is especially true when those opinions are archived for all to see; it's too easy for a reader to check out that archive and find examples of when the market and hindsight combine to make even logical arguments seem foolish. I am fully aware of that, but when it comes to yesterday’s earnings release from Apple (AAPL), I will still say ""told you!""

What really matters about the Apple release to investors is certainly not that I got it right, nor is it even that the tech giant returned to growth in revenue for the first time in a year, nor that the already great margins at Apple increased. Those last two are important, but necessarily backward looking, as all hard data in an earnings release are by definition.

What matters most is what the report tells us about the future and there the message was somewhat mixed.

The official guidance for Q1 2017 contained in the release fell just short of Wall Street’s expectations, which would normally be enough of a negative to more than offset the good historical results. In this case, though, a look at where Apple succeeded in Q4 2016 suggests that that guidance may just be another example of Apple’s past tendency to err on the side of under-promising and over-delivering when it comes to guidance. That is why, even though growth stalled last year, AAPL has beaten EPS expectations in three of the last four quarters.

First and foremost, iPhone sales hit another record. That is particularly significant as not that long ago many were predicting that Google parent Alphabet (GOOG: GOOGL)’s move into the phone business would do Apple some serious harm. It looks now as if those saying that were about as accurate as those that maintained that the Windows phone from Microsoft (MSFT) or the Amazon (AMZN) Fire phone would be the next big thing.

The fact is that the iPhone has an iconic status that looks almost impossible to challenge. Even phones that are objectively better in some ways, such as memory capacity, camera resolution, or speaker quality for example, cannot take market share. As Apple advances the iPhone with each release, beating them on those and other fronts becomes harder, but remains, according to the evidence so far, a pointless exercise. As long as that dynamic remains, holding Apple stock and adding to holdings at times of weakness still makes sense for investors.

The weakness in this release was mainly in one area; iPad sales declined for the twelfth successive quarter. That, however, was offset to some extent by strong sales of Macs and Apple Watches. For the latter we are reliant on the word of Tim Cook as Apple doesn’t release a breakdown of watch sales, but, as I pointed out in the article referenced above, anybody who tried to buy a Series Two watch as a Christmas gift is probably aware that sales were at least more than Apple expected. None were available in any of the five states where I tried and most stores have just now received inventory.

That shortage of watches, combined with Cook’s admission that they seriously underestimated demand for the iPhone 7 Plus, means that the record sales reported yesterday were achieved with a background of supply constraints. Given that and the fact that there was considerable growth in areas such as services and enterprise operations that still have lots of room for Apple to expand, the message underlying yesterday’s earnings is that, despite conventional wisdom, growth can still be achieved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) announced HomeKit - its strategy for becoming the center of the smart home - in June 2014. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) revealed its Alexa-powered Echo smart speaker that November.

Source: Apple/Amazon

While there are currently several dozen HomeKit compatible smart home products, Amazon's Alexa is now connected to thousands of smart products and services and has spread from the Echo to third-party devices.

On the surface, it looks as though Amazon has outmaneuvered and thoroughly trounced Apple. But despite the seemingly insurmountable lead and momentum, AAPL could still end up beating AMZN in this smart home race.

Here's how.

Apple Chose the Closed Approach With HomeKit

Apple tends to be extremely cautious. Its software is designed to be user-friendly and secure. iPhone apps can't just be downloaded from anywhere; they need to go through the official App Store and that requires approval by AAPL. Third-party hardware needs to be certified by Apple before it can be marketed as being iOS-compatible.

It's that ""walled"" approach that has made the iPhone more secure than smartphones running Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Android operating system.

With the iPhone and Siri - Apple's voice assistant - at the center of Apple's smart home strategy, that focus on security, compatibility and ease of use carried over to HomeKit . Manufacturers who want to make their smart devices HomeKit-compatible face a daunting series of requirements.

As pointed out in a recent Reuters article on differing smart home approaches , this includes being forced to buy a special HomeKit chip, being limited to approved (and more expensive than average) Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chips and even extends to manufacturing being limited to factories that are certified by Apple. End-to-end encryption is mandatory. Once a HomeKit product is ready, it faces extensive testing by Apple engineers to ensure compatibility. Then it may be sold. That process alone can take three to five months.

So you have additional costs, the procedural red tape and a delay. It's easy to understand why Apple currently lists only 75 or so HomeKit-compatible devices . And half of those are either different color options or regional variations of the same product.

Amazon Alexa Is Open for Business

Amazon took a radically different approach with its Echo speaker and Alexa. The company openly courted third-party companies to develop Alexa ""skills"" or software-enabled interactions with an Amazon Alexa-powered device.

A skill can be the ability to tell Alexa to order an Uber . It could also be telling Alexa to turn on your home's smart lights or to start your electric car. The process is simple. Amazon provides an example showing how to build an Alexa skill in 60 minutes , and that includes the time needed to create a developer account. Submit the skill to AMZN for a quick verification, and it's published.

That's how Amazon Alexa tripled its available skills in just three months last year, hitting 3,000 in September. If that sounds impressive, by CES 2017 in January, it had hit more than 7,000 Alexa skills.

In addition to skills, Amazon also encourages third parties to integrate Alexa functionality into their products. That way, consumers get the Alexa experience without requiring an Echo speaker.

That's a far easier process than Apple HomeKit certification. A ""Works with Alexa"" label takes about 10 days to obtain (it can even be issued by third party labs) and doesn't require special chips. According to the Reuters post, that has resulted in over 250 products that are Alexa-certified. We saw some of these at CES, including third-party speakers with Alexa and even home appliances with built-in Alexa capability.

Smart Home Security: Apple Strength, Amazon Alexa Vulnerability

The differing approaches of AMZN and AAPL have led to Alexa rapidly leaping to a massive lead over HomeKit in the smart home. However, there is one scenario where this could change rapidly.

Security is increasingly becoming an issue for smart, connected devices. Apple's HomeKit approach emphasizes security, to the point of forcing the use of specialized chips and even certified manufacturing facilities.

Amazon's Alexa strategy, on the other hand, leaves its platform relatively exposed. Amazon told Reuters it can't guarantee the security of third-party devices running Alexa. Those thousands of Alexa skills also integrate with third-party services that may have their own vulnerabilities.

All it would take is one catastrophic hacking for a PR disaster that turns consumers off Alexa. As CNET puts it in a review of the hacking risks for different smart home standards : ""Don't assume that a device has high security standards just because it works with Alexa.""

Bottom Line

There's no disputing the fact that Amazon completely caught Apple and others off guard with its stealthy approach of sneaking Alexa into the home using its Echo connected speaker.

Before the Echo, it was generally assumed that a smartphone would be the natural smart home controller. Making Alexa integration so open has also paid off for AMZN, resulting in a formidable lead in the smart home in a very short time. That lead may well turn into complete domination of the connected home. But Amazon's open approach may also prove to be its Achilles heel.

Should hackers turn their attention to Amazon Alexa, the resulting headlines may flip the equation and put the much more secure Apple HomeKit on top in the long run.

Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) opened for trade Feb. 1 at an all-time high - a market cap of $365 billion - on the strength of its dominance in mobile apps. But the big news is that Facebook is about to challenge the video league leaders with a mobile app for existing streaming boxes like the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) TV. The question is, what will this do for FB stock?

Source: Shutterstock

Moving into TV through an app rather than a device makes sense, given the failure of the original Facebook phone and its overwhelming success with apps for others' phones.

FB is already bankrolling the creation of videos for the video tab of its mobile app.

So where does Facebook fit its service into the evolving market, and what does its presence as a broadcaster mean to its claims not to be a media company?

FB Stock: TV vs. Phone

The company is already a presence in video thanks to Facebook Live , which allows live streaming of video on the service and it has a Presidential endorsement.

FB has prepared to offer longer videos by introducing ""mid-roll"" ads - ads that play in the middle of a video - to its line-up, making the service more TV-like.

Over time, this might allow Facebook to compete directly with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) YouTube in the growing market for streaming services.

The problem is that there is a big difference between the experience you get on a mobile phone and what you want on a TV screen. A phone is active, a TV is passive. A phone may support videos of a few minutes, while people will watch TV for hours-and-hours.

There is an assumption in the breathless reporting of Facebook's latest move that TV is easy; that it's just something you throw money at. Given the success of Netflix in generating subscribers and Emmys, and Amazon in generating Prime members and Oscar buzz, that is an easy mistake to make.

Worth the Candle?

For Facebook stock, this may not be as huge a deal as analysts think.

Netflix revenue is only a fraction of FB stock's. Analysts expect Facebook to deliver over $27 billion in 2016 revenue when it reports after the market closes Feb. 1. This is against roughly $9 billion for Netflix. NFLX also brings just 3% of that revenue to the bottom line, while FB stock brings nearly one-third of revenue to its net income line.

Entering the world of creating television poses another risk. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly said he doesn't run a media company , that his is just a communications service. Media companies have responsibilities to truth and accuracy that, say, phone companies don't have - responsibilities that can limit profitability.

If Facebook is going to license content from media suppliers, whether live or scripted, it becomes a media company, subject to political and public scrutiny for its programming choices, on a global basis. This is a dance FB stock shareholders should fear, because it costs money to play, and carries risk.

But Facebook may now have no choice in the matter. The big screen is the last frontier for internet services, it's where everyone is heading. FB stock does not want to be left behind.

The Bottom Line on Facebook Stock

While most analysts are jumping for joy over the Facebook TV app news, I am a lot more cautious. This move has enormous implications for the entire company, for how it's perceived and (more important) what it costs to run.

FB, like Alphabet, prefers to manage itself through algorithms. Algorithms scale in ways people do not. Facebook is starting to bow to pressure on the media front, hiring Campbell Brown to coordinate media alliances. Now it's about to become a TV network, or at least a streaming service.

What will that mean to its profitability and growth? I think they both slow, because people aren't algorithms and talent has temper that code does not have. Politics can kill the media star.

iPhone Has A Solid Quarter Amid Shipment And ASP Growth

Shipments of the iPhone touched record highs, growing by 5% year-over-year to about 78.3 million units, driven by strong demand for the iPhone 7 and carrier promotions in the United States. Sales growth could have been higher (~8%) on a sell-through basis, as Apple reduced channel inventory over the quarter. iPhone ASPs came in at a record high of $695 per unit, as the demand mix for the larger 7 Plus was higher compared to previous iterations. Moreover, the increasing shift towards mechanisms such as equipment installment plans and leases, where buyers do not pay anything upfront for their devices, are also helping to skew the demand mix towards higher-tier models. Apple's total revenue guidance for Q2 FY'17 stands at $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion (4% year-over-year at the mid-point). This is relatively strong, considering that the iPhone 7 is largely viewed as a bridge device, with Apple prepping to unveil a completely overhauled 10th anniversary iPhone this fall.

Greater China Sees An Improvement On Constant Currency Basis

Apple's gross margins came in at 38.5% for the quarter. While this was at the high end of the company's guidance range, it was roughly 150 bps lower than last year's figure. There are likely to be two key factors driving this reduction. Firstly, the strong dollar is hurting Apple's price realizations in many key emerging markets. Moreover, there is a possibility that manufacturing costs on the new iPhones are higher, on account of the more advanced components and higher memory capacity per devices. (Related: Apple's Flagship iPhone Keeps Getting More Expensive To Build ) However, this is likely to have been partially offset by a higher mix of service revenues (9.1% of total sales, up from 8% last year), which have significantly higher gross margins. Apple is projecting gross margins of between 38% and 39% for Q2 FY'17.

Greater China Sees An Improvement On Constant Currency Basis

Apple's performance in Greater China saw some improvement, driven by a strong uptake for the iPhone 7, which emerged the best selling smartphone in the country during the holiday quarter, as well as double digit growth in iPad shipments. Revenues from the region came in at $16.23 billion, marking a 12% year-over-year decline, amid depreciation of the Chinese Yuan (down 6% year-over-year) as well as a significant decline in sales from Hong Kong. However, the company says that sales from Mainland China would have actually been up by about 6% on a constant current basis, marking a significant improvement over the firm's performance in the recent quarters.

Services Growth Remains Strong, Watch Could Be Gaining Momentum

Services revenues rose by roughly 18% year-over-year to an all time record of $7.17 billion, driven primarily by the App Store, which saw revenues grow by 43% over the quarter and the Apple Music streaming music service. This is positive, considering that the rate of growth in Apple's iDevice installed base is likely to be slowing down, potentially indicating that per-device spending on services is trending upwards. Apple indicated that it was looking to double its services revenues over the next four years. Apple also noted that the Apple Watch had its best quarter ever both in terms of units and revenues, with demand outstripping supply.

The two main beneficiaries of the growth in digital advertising are Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , which owns Google.

Indeed, the two companies completely dominate the digital advertising market, combining to take about 60% of the market. Both companies are growing rapidly, especially considering their size, but which is the better buy right now?

A look at valuation

Both Facebook and Alphabet trade for relatively high valuations, which would leave them off the buy list of many investors. But both companies arguably deserve their high valuations because of their rapid growth and the industry trend supporting them.

Company P/E (forward) P/S (TTM) P/FCF (TTM) PEG Facebook 24.9 15.2 43.2 0.95 Alphabet 20.0 6.8 24.8 1.06

Investors are valuing Facebook's expected earnings and earnings growth near the same levels as Alphabet, but that puts a premium on Facebook's trailing-12-month sales and free cash flow compared to Alphabet's.

Facebook does sport a significantly larger operating margin compared with Alphabet (45%, versus 26% in the third quarter), which makes its sales more valuable, but no more than twice as valuable. Likewise, Facebook's free cash flow doesn't deserve to be given nearly twice the value as Alphabet's.

For investors looking for a growth stock with a good valuation, Alphabet shares definitely take the title here.

Image source: Alphabet

What about growth?

A great growth stock, however, will produce significant earnings growth for its shareholders. You'll notice the one valuation where Facebook outshines Alphabet (albeit just barely) is in its PEG ratio -- the only metric shown that accounts for growth.

Indeed, analysts expect Facebook to continue growing rapidly over the next five years, with a compound annual earnings growth rate of 35.5%. Analysts expect Alphabet to produce EPS growth of just 18.6% on average through 2021. That's nearly half the rate of Facebook's growth -- and that's what you get for the premium price you'll pay for Facebook.

Facebook's management recently warned that advertising revenue growth on its flagship platform will slow about midway through 2017, but it still has several other major potential revenue drivers.

Instagram is still in the early days of advertising, and analysts at Credit Suisse estimate it could generate $6.4 billion in 2017 (double 2016) and $12 billion by 2021. For reference, Facebook is expected to produce $27.3 billion in sales this year.

Facebook's Oculus just started selling hardware a bit over a year ago, and Mark Zuckerberg expects VR to be the next big computing platform. Not to mention Facebook has 1 billion users for both Messenger and WhatsApp left to monetize.

Meanwhile, Alphabet's growth will come mainly from the continued trend of growing digital advertising spend, which largely benefits Google. YouTube may also help drive revenue growth, but it's a much more mature advertising platform compared to Instagram and carries lower margins than Google's main ad products. While the company has several moonshots that could turn out to be huge profit machines in the future, even Alphabet's small wins are dwarfed by the size of Google.

For investors looking for a growth stock with the most potential for growth, Facebook is a better buy than Alphabet.

Apple Touches 18-Month Highs

Apple stock soared to 18-month highs Wednesday after the company's earnings beat consensus estimates, fueled by record iPhone sales. Apple's fiscal first quarter marked a return to growth for the company, which had seen declining sales and EPS in the preceding three quarters.

Apple stock jumped 6.2% to 128.87 in the stock market today, hitting its highest price since July 2015. Apple stock touched its record high of 134.54 in April 2015. Apple broke out of a cup-with-handle base on Jan. 9, clearing a buy point at 118.12, so shares are now extended.

Facebook Ad Growth Should Highlight Q4 Results

Facebook reports fourth-quarter earnings after the market close Wednesday, where analysts will focus on advertising revenue growth. During its Q3 conference call, Facebook warned that the growth pace of advertising dollars would slow, due to ad saturation

Wall Street expects Facebook to report revenue of $8.5 billion, up 46% year over year and the second quarter in a row of revenue deceleration.

The revenue slowdown is attributable mostly to a deliberate move by Facebook to cool the growth in advertising to avoid saturation. Analysts expect earnings per share minus items to rise 66% to $1.31, also marking further cooling after huge gains of 91% in Q3 and 94% in Q2.

The Wall Street Journal reports that Facebook is developing a video app for television set-top boxes, including Apple TV, as it looks for ways to grow ad sales.

Facebook stock closed Wednesday up 2.2% ahead of its Q4 earnings report, at 133.23. Shares remain in a buy zone from their breakout last week at 129.37.

Amazon Air Force Taking Flight

Amazon confirmed late Tuesday that it will build its first centralized air hub, in Kentucky, to support its growing fleet of Prime Air cargo planes. At the site, Amazon expects to create more than 2,000 new jobs. Amazon says it already employs 10,000 in the Bluegrass State.

Amazon reports earnings after the market close Thursday, with concerns that heavy investments and currency exchange could dampen earnings.

Analysts estimate revenue of $44.7 billion, which would be up 25% from Q4 2015 and maintain a steady string of double-digit growth going back more than four years. Analysts expect earnings per share minus items to rise 35% to $1.35.

Amazon stock rose 1.1% to 832.19 Wednesday, still in a buy zone.

Alphabet Undercuts Breakout Price

Alphabet reported fourth-quarter results last Thursday, with the company missing views on earnings per share but topping expectations on revenue.

Alphabet stock fell 0.6% Wednesday to 815.24. That undercuts its breakout at a buy point of 824.40 first touched on Jan. 6.

Netflix Still Extended From Breakout

Netflix stock rose 7 cents to 140.78 on Wednesday. The stock remains extended from its last buy point at 129.40, out of a cup-with-handle base, first touched on Jan. 4.

Netflix remains a member of the IBD Leaderboard of top-performing stocks at or near buy points, though the stock has met resistance around 142 for nearly two weeks.

Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ) disrupts what we drive, and Uber even disrupts whether we drive. If a teen with 2 million Instagram followers can disrupt how billion-dollar businesses find customers, the rest of us need to dive in and start swimming … or at least buy the one stock which has its hands in all of the above: Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ).

Source: Shutterstock

Simply put, GOOGL stock is the most innovative, most disruptive and cheapest $800 equity I know.

Let me explain.

Silicon Valley money manager Michael Moe and his team at GSV Asset Management produce a provocative weekly newsletter dedicated to highlighting where they think the world is going. While doing research for my Bullseye Brief, one of their recent pieces got me thinking about innovation in more tangible terms. The team ranked eight global technology companies based on their involvement across 22 cutting-edge categories. Hands down, Alphabet ranks No. 1, capturing 21 of 22.

Innovation Leaders

Curiously, all eight GSV-highlighted companies have dedicated efforts in the areas of artificial intelligence, big data and cloud services, making these three the Holy Grail of innovation.

The first two come as no surprise, as data gathering and analysis are critical to predicting behavior, enabling companies to target consumers accordingly. Web services, which is now the fastest-growing segment for Amazon, is less obvious but nonetheless a clear indicator these innovators want to get bigger by serving as the backbone for other companies.

This is key, and since Google already commands 49% of the global online advertising market according to Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser, I’ll bet on GOOGL.

Moonshot

Much of Google’s innovative efforts happen at its off-site research center called Google X, aka the Moonshot Factory. It’s run by a futurist named Astro Teller, and I highly recommend his TED Talk explaining how Google X approaches innovation:

Identify a problem affecting millions of people. Find or propose a radical solution for solving that problem. Move full speed ahead if there’s reason to believe technology for such a radical solution could actually be built.

He says Google X people spend most of their time “breaking things and trying to prove they’re wrong” but believes that’s their secret … what makes Googlers different. By “killing” more projects than they approve, their success rate rises. Alphabet spent $13.8 billion last year on research and development — the second highest number of any company in the world behind Amazon, and second highest as a percentage of sales among the eight innovation leaders.

R&D as % of Revenue

Alphabet invests a staggering amount of money to fund R&D, both because it can and because it has to. With three times more online advertising than its next closest competitor, GOOGL is a cash cow.

By the same token, it has significant overlap with all seven competitors in the most obvious categories — like robotics and AI– and each of these companies is hungry to dominate.

There’s no letting up in this crowd. Innovate or die.

What’s GOOGL Stock Worth?

Ultimately, the question is value: What do we pay?

Alphabet's revenue jumped to $26.1 billion, up 22 percent over the same quarter last year, surpassing Wall Street estimates. Net income saw an 8.3-percent increase to $5.33 billion, missing estimates, which the company blamed on a one-time tax adjustment. Shares fell 2.1 percent in after-hours trading.

A huge chunk of the company's revenue increase mostly came from Google's advertising business, $3.4 billion of which comes from other business segments like hardware sales, Google's Play Store and its Cloud services.

Advertisement

Clicks on Google ads or paid clicks - ads on which an advertiser pays only if a user clicks on them - saw a 36-percent increase in the fourth quarter compared to the 33-percent increase seen in the third quarter.

""Our growth in the fourth quarter was exceptional - with revenues up 22 percent year-on-year and 24 percent on a constant currency basis,"" said Ruth Porat, CFO of Alphabet.

""This performance was led by mobile search and YouTube. We're seeing great momentum in Google's newer investment areas and ongoing strong progress in other bets,"" Porat added.

According to an article on Reuters, the company's quarterly results were met with a mixed reaction from Wall Street, which sent shares toppling 2.2 percent to $838 in extended trade after closing at $856.98 on Nasdaq.

The article mentioned Google faced a higher tax rate of 22 percent, compared to the 19 percent for the year overall, and this has contributed to the dent in profitability.

""If you look above that, it's business as usual,"" said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management. ""There has been no margin compression in the actual business.""

On iOS, Chrome has to use Apple’s WebKit rendering engine instead of Google’s own Blink engine. Because of this, Google didn’t add the Chrome for iOS code to the Chromium code base before. Supporting both rendering engines in the same code base, after all, adds quite a bit of complexity.

Over the last few years, though, Google’s team worked on making the necessary code changes to add the Chrome for iOS code to Chromium. That work is now complete and developers who want to compile the iOS version of Chromium can now take the iOS code from the Chromium repository and do so (assuming, of course, that they run OS X and use Xcode).

Google argues that this move also means that the development speed for Chrome for iOS will now be faster, thanks to the fact that all of the tests the team runs on Chromium can now also automatically run on the Chrome for iOS code base, too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That's why investment professionals typically recommend investors take a long-term approach to investing to reduce the risk of losing principal. If you invest at the wrong time, you could lose a significant amount of your money overnight, so keep in mind that stocks are not always the best short-term investments.

That said, stock prices work both ways. A prudent — or lucky — investor could make a great deal of money just as rapidly as he could lose it. If you have a tolerance for risk and are willing to do the research, short-term trading might be a solution for at least part of your portfolio.

If you decide to go this route, don't hesitate to contact a financial professional if you need assistance. Most important, if you're looking for stocks to buy now, do your homework to find good ones in which to invest. You can begin here with this list of 15 stocks to buy that might be the best short-term investments for your portfolio.

Apple is one of the best-known companies in America, thanks in no small part to the iPhone. It's also the largest U.S. company in terms of market capitalization — the value of a company that's traded on the stock market — a number you can calculate by multiplying a company's stock price by the number of its outstanding shares. In the case of Apple, this number topped $618 billion as of late December 2016, coming in ahead of competitors Alphabet at $548 billion, Microsoft at $494.6 billion, Amazon at $366 billion and Facebook at $343.1 billion.

Apple stock is positioned to move even higher in 2017. The company is aggressively buying back stock, which reduces the number of outstanding shares and increases earnings per share. Its latest iPhones, the 7 and 7 Plus, are the best-selling phones in its history. Apple also holds roughly $200 billion in overseas cash, which might move home this year if corporate taxes on repatriation are lowered. To top it all off, the stock is trading at just about 10 times earnings.

2. Gilead Sciences: GILD

If you're looking for a short-term stock that had a rough go of it in 2016, Gilead Sciences might be your pick. The biotechnology company's sales of its hepatitis C drug declined and the stock fell 29 percent in 2016.

Gilead could turn out to be one of the best stocks for 2017, however. The company trades at the compelling valuation of 6.99 times estimated earnings over the next year. It's bought back 14 percent of its stock over the past three years, and with its $32 billion cash hoard, the company might continue to buy more or make strategic acquisitions. Gilead also uses its cash to pay out a 2.5 percent dividend to shareholders. The stock could very well hit $101 in 2017, according to analysts at JP Morgan.

Alphabet, formerly known as Google, is one of the world's great businesses, according to Barron's. The company owns numerous products and services including Google Maps and Google Play, YouTube, Nest, Chrome, Android, and Gmail. Analysts project 2017 revenues for the company in excess of $103 billion, which would represent a growth rate of more than 18 percent.

Given the current political climate, Alphabet might see a short-term boost in the form of repatriated cash. The company currently holds about $80 billion in cash overseas, which translates to around $115 per share. Additionally, it has a lot of room for cost cutting because it spends freely on noncore businesses. Some analysts are estimating $41 per share in earnings this year, which would be huge since the company currently trades at just 18 times earnings.

Even if you don't use Facebook at home or on your smartphone, it's hard to avoid its presence in store windows or on advertising asking you to ""like"" something. The key to Facebook's financial success is its monetization of its enormous customer base. It has 1.79 billion monthly active users — and that number continues to rise. Lately, Facebook's stock price has gone up and exceeded analyst earnings estimates by an average of 21.11 percent.

Facebook is still investing in ways to grow its earnings even more, with mobile ads and video revenues currently doing the heavy lifting. The company is also expecting big things out of its virtual reality investments. With a long-term growth rate of 27.6 percent, the company is expected to continue its rise.

Citigroup could benefit from a number of factors in 2017, including rising interest rates. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates for just the second time in a decade in 2016. The Fed indicated that it expects to hike rates an additional three times in 2017. In response, the two-year Treasury note hit its highest rate since 2009. When interest rates rise, banks can charge more money on loans and credit cards, potentially increasing their profitability.

Citigroup's stock has lagged compared with its peers' so far in 2017, which gives it room to catch up. The stock trades at just about 11 times its expected earnings for next year — and it trades at the widest discount-to-book value of the major banks. This means the stock is discounted more than 25 percent compared with the price-earnings ratios of its peers, making it a possible value play.

IBM is another turnaround candidate for 2017. The company used to dominate the computer hardware and services business sector but has been surpassed in recent years by its competitors. However, its slow turn toward the more modern businesses of artificial intelligence, cloud computing, mobility and security is showing signs of bearing fruit.

The company spent more than $5 billion in acquisitions in 2016 alone, and its new product lines now account for more than 40 percent of firm revenues. Its analytics division showed revenue growth of 16 percent, and its cloud business jumped by 42 percent — both hopeful signs for future growth. IBM's artificial intelligence business has generated positive buzz thanks to its Watson cognitive system, which is known for beating two human ""Jeopardy!"" contestants. The stock trades at a 12.19 price-earnings ratio based on expected 2017 earnings.

7. Norwegian Cruise Line: NCLH

Norwegian Cruise Line is poised to benefit from the rapidly growing cruise segment and could be one of the best stocks to buy now. With the core demographic of aging baby boomers on the rise, cruise lines are a growing market. The company doesn't pay dividends to shareholders but reinvests its cash flow into building more ships and expanding its routes. Norwegian has already won approval to sail to Cuba, and it has repositioned its calendar to deploy ships into the fast-growing Asian market for the first time in 15 years.

Norwegian boasts the newest fleet among its major North American competitors, making it attractive to customers looking for the latest and greatest offerings. The company owns a diversified portfolio of maritime brands including Oceania and Regent Seven Seas. Analysts estimate the stock will grow earnings by more than 18 percent in 2017 — the stock trades at just 14 times 2017 estimates.

Amazon has grown from an online bookseller to the eighth-largest retailer in the world, and it hasn't shown any signs of slowing down. Amazon will become the largest apparel seller in the U.S. by 2021, when it will be selling $62 billion in apparel annually — more than TJ Maxx and Macy's combined — according to analysts at Cowen Group.

Amazon is firing on multiple fronts: It's poised to capitalize on streaming media's popularity via its Amazon Prime subscription service. Additionally, its Web Services business is more advanced than competitors Microsoft and Alphabet's cloud offerings, thanks to it being first to market. Analysts at Evercore ISI Institutional Equities cite Amazon as the best internet stock for 2017. Excitement is also brewing over Amazon's latest foray into the grocery business, Amazon Go. In true disruptor fashion, Amazon's take on the grocery store is to use sensors rather than grocery clerks.

9. Restoration Hardware: RH

Restoration Hardware is a well-known, luxury home furnishings brand that suffered through 2016. Its earnings fell and triggered a stock sell-off in which shares lost more than half their value. However, the company has shown some signs of being a possible candidate for short-term traders. In its most recent quarter, revenue actually rose 3 percent and beat analysts' estimates by more than $20 million. Earnings also beat Wall Street expectations by 4 cents per share.

In addition to rebounding sales and earnings, Restoration Hardware conducted an image makeover. Going forward, the company will be called simply ""RH."" Additionally, the company has launched a new, RH Modern line. In an attempt to capitalize on a more current type of revenue stream, RH is now offering annual memberships. As a result, analysts peg the company's five-year earnings growth rate at 20.33 percent, with earnings for the upcoming year jumping 61.27 percent.

10. Toll Brothers: TOL

Toll Brothers is a leading luxury home builder, a business that's been hit hard on many fronts. Although risks remain, the fear of rising interest rates dampening homebuying activity has sent Toll Brothers stock to a bargain price. The company now trades at less than 10 times its anticipated 2017 earnings, which are expected by some to rise 20 percent.

Some concerns over the luxury condo market in New York City also hang over the stock, but company reps indicate that earnings will hold up. With the stock seemingly priced for a worst-case scenario, its valuation of about 1.2 times book value is compelling. If housing markets hold firm or interest rates don't rise dramatically, Toll Brothers stock could prove surprising to those anticipating the worst.

11. Deutsche Telekom: DTEGY

Deutsche Telekom is a German stock that many investors might recognize as the former parent of U.S. T-Mobile. The company still owns a 65 percent stake in the independently traded T-Mobile — and that stock has been skyrocketing. Deutsche's core European telecom business trades at a discount compared with its peers — it fell by 13 percent in 2016 — even though it's the leading wired and wireless operator in Germany. Sporting a nearly 4 percent yield, some analysts describe the stock as undervalued.

A takeover play might happen in 2017: Comcast has had its eye on T-Mobile as a potential purchase. T-Mobile might also make another attempt to merge with Sprint, which could end up being a catalyst for Deutsche's stock. If everything falls into place, a share price of $20 isn't inconceivable.

12. Sprouts Farmers Market: SFM

Sprouts Farmers Market flies under the radar of many investors because it's not really a headline-making stock. This lack of publicity might work to its advantage, however, as more investors become aware of its potential. Sprouts is drawing customers from the growing natural and organic food segment — and it prices its goods below that of its notable peer, Whole Foods Market. As a result, some analysts see the company generating mid-teens earnings and revenue growth in the foreseeable future.

The company is growing out of its base in the American Southwest and moving east, growing 14 percent in square footage every year. Coupled with its favorable market segments, Sprouts is generating positive cash flow and returning cash to shareholders via a stock buyback program. At 20.5 times estimated 2017 earnings, the stock could be ready to move.

13. Delta Air Lines: DAL

Delta Air Lines has greatly improved its financial performance but still trades at a typical airline multiple of about nine times estimated 2017 earnings. Since 2009, Delta has worked to cut its debt in half. As a result, it now has an investment grade rating from independent ratings service Moody's. To further entice shareholders, Delta pays a 1.7 percent dividend and has aggressively repurchased stock.

Delta management feels the stock should be valued more like a diversified industrial company, which would dramatically raise its multiple, and, therefore, its share price. If you need another short-term catalyst, look at the company's free cash flow. Delta is a cash-flow machine — it generated $4.1 billion in cash flow in the last 12 months alone and put just 9.8 percent of that into dividend payments, according to Forbes.

Another value play for 2017 could be Novartis, a Swiss diversified drug company and the world's biggest prescription drugmaker. The company's share price had a difficult 2016 but now trades at about 15 times next year's earnings. With a yield of about 3.75 percent, Novartis has an analyst consensus price target of $87, some $15 north of its current price.

Part of what held Novartis back in 2016 was fear over the slow start of Entresto, its heart-failure drug, but some analysts think sales will soon accelerate and could go as high as $3 billion. Novartis also gets 25 percent of its sales from high-growth, emerging markets, which makes it less dependent on the more mature U.S. drug market. The company's recent purchase of Encore Vision should also shore up its vision sales and further enable it to diversify its holdings.

15. General Motors: GM

General Motors has been an integral part of the global auto industry for more than 100 years and has recently faced headwinds. Some market participants feel that global auto sales have peaked, and concerns over the movement to electric vehicles have held back GM stock. Whatever the reasons are, General Motors currently trades at a low price-to-earnings ratio of 4.3. Even industry competitors — like Ford, which trades at a ratio of 6.6, and Toyota, which trades at 9.7 times — trade at higher multiples, and GM's average price-earnings ratio over the past five years is 12.2.

GM could move higher as the market appreciates its emerging electric and hybrid portfolio. Some analysts feel GM has the bankroll and technology to undersell rivals such as Tesla and perhaps even compete on quality at some point. GM stock began rallying at the end of 2016, which leads some analysts to predict it could double in price over the next one or two years.

1/31/2017,0.465260606,0.140761039,796.86,801.25,790.52,796.79,2160556,10.73,-0.07,0,"Last December, I highlighted MeetMe (NASDAQ: MEET) as a potentially undervalued growth play in a frothy market. The social networking app maker posted eye-popping numbers last quarter -- 32% annual growth in monthly active users (MAUs), 20% growth in total revenues, and 30% non-GAAP earnings growth.

Analysts expect MeetMe's revenue and non-GAAP earnings to respectively rise 38% and 16% next year. Yet the stock trades at just 7 times trailing earnings and 10 times forward earnings. Let's take a look at the five key reasons investors aren't buying MeetMe's growth story, despite its high growth figures and low valuations.

MeetMe's mobile app. Image source: Google Play.

1. A troubling history with sexual predators

MeetMe lets users find new people in their area to chat with, similar to Match 's(NASDAQ: MTCH) Tinder. While there's nothing inherently sinister about the app, there have been multiple reports of MeetMe being used by sexual predators.

In 2014, the City of San Francisco sued MeetMe for the unlawful publication of minors' profiles, photos, and geolocation data, and claimed that the app ""enabled"" sexual predators to find their victims. The city cited several cases involving adult men and minors in which MeetMe was used. MeetMe settled the case for $200,000 the following year, agreeing to clarify and simplify its user agreements and settings, and reducing the amount of data displayed on minors to their city and state.

But the cases involving MeetMe didn't cease -- last February, a Buffalo man was charged with multiple counts of child pornography after using MeetMe to find minors. MeetMe's troubles raised red flags at Tinder, which hiked its age limit from 13 to 18 last June. Yet MeetMe still hasn't followed suit, presumably because it would lose a large portion of its users.

2. The potential loss of ad revenues

You'd think that big companies would be reluctant to advertise on MeetMe, but plenty of big brands still advertise on the app. That's because MeetMe generates most of its ad revenues from programmatic ads delivered by Twitter 's(NYSE: TWTR ) MoPub.

This means that MoPub's customers simply pick a demographic -- in MeetMe's case, younger users and Millennials -- and the platform feeds the ads to various apps. This means that many companies probably don't realize that their ads are appearing on MeetMe.

Therefore, a common bear thesis is that MoPub could decide to drop MeetMe due to violations of its terms of service, or advertisers could ask MoPub to pull their ads from the controversial app. There's no evidence either of these scenarios will occur, but it raises a troubling question -- if MeetMe's reputation worsens, can it still keep growing its ad revenues?

3. Being booted from the app stores

In its 10-K filing for fiscal 2015, MeetMe admits that its business will suffer if it is ""unable to maintain a good relationship"" with Apple and Alphabet 's Google. It notes that its app could be pulled from their app stores ""if we violate"" or the companies believe ""that we have violated"" their terms and conditions.

The bulls might believe that's just a typical ""risk factor"" warning, but MeetMe admits in the same filing that ""on more than one occasion,"" Apple rejected its app ""because of user generated content and other concerns."" This indicates that another high-profile lawsuit could knock MeetMe out of the app stores and kill its business.

4. Tinder is crushing MeetMe

MeetMe arrived before Tinder, which was initially launched in 2012. But over the past five years, mainstream interest in MeetMe waned in correlation with Tinder's growth, as seen in this chart from Google Trends:

Image source: Google.

That decline also explains why MeetMe acquired its competitor Skout last October. That move boosted the company's MAU count from about 5 million to 8.5 million, and greatly inflated MeetMe's top and bottom line growth for fiscal 2016.

5. The lack of insider confidence

If MeetMe is as undervalued as the fundamentals suggest, you'd expect insiders to be loading up on shares. However, MeetMe CEO Geoffrey Cook just sold 250,000 shares (16% of his entire position) at an average price of $5.02.

Including Cook's sales, insiders sold 1.96 million shares over the past 12 months, but only bought 334,000 shares. It's understandable that MeetMe's insiders would sell after the stock's 50% rally over the past 12 months, but it also indicates that its upside potential could be limited.

The key takeaway

The main lesson here is to always look beyond the valuations and growth forecasts. On the surface, MeetMe looks like a rapidly growing social app maker trading at a discount to its peers. But dig deeper, and you'll see an app that's struggling to prove that it's not a tool for criminals while remaining relevant against Tinder, which dominates the space with over 50 million active users.

Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) took its turn in the earnings limelight last week, and investors were not happy with the results. Offering up a rare miss , Alphabet said it earned $9.36 per share versus expectations of $9.63 per share, while revenue arrived at $26.06 billion compared to predictions for $25.22 billion.

GOOGL stock has since fallen more than 5%, and its edging lower once again today.

But the shares were due for a bit of a selloff, as GOOGL stock was overbought heading into earnings amid an overly enthusiastic sentiment backdrop. Contrarian investors know that this is a recipe for short-term disaster on even the slightest hiccup.



Click to Enlarge Now that the knee-jerk selling has about run its course, it's time to get back to being realistic on GOOGL stock's prospects. Technically, Alphabet shares remain in a long-term uptrend, supported by its 10-week and 20-week moving averages.

Furthermore, these trendlines completed a bullish cross earlier this month, which could bring bargain hunters to the table once the post-earnings gyrations have subsided.

As for sentiment, the fourth-quarter earnings blip for GOOGL stock hasn't shaken the brokerage community one bit. And it shouldn't. According to Thomson/First Call, all but two of the 48 analysts following Alphabet Inc rate the shares a ""buy"" or better. Additionally, the 12-month price target of $988.47 represents a modest premium of only about 19% to GOOGL's Monday close.

With search ad revenue holding strong and Alphabet expanding its hardware program, we may even see a few upward revisions in the next month or so.

On the options front, GOOGL Feb./March put/call open interest ratio has risen slightly in the past week to rest at 0.72, with puts gaining a bit of traction in the wake of last week's quarterly report. For the March series, traders are still eyeing the $860 and $900 strikes, while put traders are focused on $800 and $750.

Overall, March implieds are pricing in a potential move of about 5% in the next two months. Currently, this places the upper bound at $865.02, while the lower bound lies at $782.64 from Monday's close. I would be surprised to see GOOGL stock trade south of $800, as it would take some unexpectedly poor news from Alphabet or a significant turn in the overall market. A rally to $860 seems more likely, though resistance at $850 could be a stumbling block.

2 Trades for GOOGL Stock

Put Sell: The safest route to profit on GOOGL stock right now would be to bank on technical support and sell option premium. Right now, the March $800 put looks like a solid bet for such a play. At last check, this put was bid at $12, or $1,200 per contract.

As usual, you keep the premium as long as GOOGL stock closes above $800 when these options expire. The downside is that should Alphabet trade below $800 ahead of March expiration, you could be assigned 100 shares for each sold put at a cost of $800 per share.

Call Spread: If you are more bullish on GOOGL stock's prospects, then a March $830/$850 bull call spread has potential At last check, this spread was offered at $8, or $800 per pair of contracts.

Breakeven lies at $838.00, while a maximum profit of $12, or $1,200 per pair of contracts, is possible if Alphabet closes at or above $850 when March options expire.

Don't look now, but Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) looks to be taking another run at Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ) Chrome operating system. References have begun popping up in builds of the Windows 10 Creators Update (which is due to arrive in April) to Windows 10 Cloud.

Source: Microsoft

Speculation is growing that Windows 10 Cloud is in fact a new simplified version of Microsoft's operating system, designed to run on devices powered by inexpensive ARM chips from ARM Holdings plc (ADR) (NASDAQ: ARMH ).

In other words, it appears that Microsoft is preparing to take on the threat of Chromebooks - the cheap, popular laptops running Google's Chrome OS. And it seems to be doing so by resurrecting the idea of Windows RT.

Windows 10 Cloud

Windows 10 Creators Build is the next major revision of the Microsoft Windows PC operating system. It's due to begin rolling out to users around April 17.

But developers have been testing pre-release builds of Microsoft's software and recently some of them began to notice something strange: The code references different variations of the operating system. For example, Windows 10 Pro for Workstation and Windows 10 for Enterprise are spiked out. Nothing unusual there. But then, references to Windows 10 Cloud began to appear. And that started raising eyebrows - what is Windows 10 Cloud?

ZDNet's Mary Jo Foley put the pieces together yesterday. Quoting unnamed sources, she says that the mysterious Windows 10 Cloud is a new, simplified version of Microsoft Windows that will run only Unified Windows Platform (UWP) apps. In other words, it's a ""simpler, safer, cheaper"" version of Windows 10 .

You might also think of it as another crack at Windows RT …

Windows RT? But Why?

Everyone remembers the mess that was Windows RT . The attempt to shoehorn a version of Windows onto a consumer tablet running ARM chips -the ill-fated Surface RT - very nearly dealt MSFT's tablet aspirations a fatal blow.

However, despite the failure of Windows RT, Microsoft has never given up on the idea of Windows on ARM chips. By doing so, it can get Windows onto mobile devices that can't use the more powerful and expensive chips from Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC ). The company has already been showing off Windows 10 running in emulation on high-end ARM chips . As part of that effort, it could also be working on a ""lite"" version that can deliver much of the Windows 10 experience on less expensive, lower powered ARM hardware.

So why, why, why would Microsoft risk falling flat on its face again with what essentially amounts to another crack at Windows RT? There are two reasons.

The first is that dream of ""Windows everywhere."" Having the full Windows 10 experience on high-powered ARM chips is great, but only flagship smartphones and tablets can afford to use those chips. Windows 10 Cloud would get Microsoft Windows (and Bing) onto a whole lot more mobile hardware.

The second is Google's Chrome OS and Chromebooks. These cheap laptops have been under Microsoft's skin for years. They've become extremely popular in the education sector thanks to low cost, ease of use and built-in security. And Chromebooks have just kept selling, to the point where last year they passed even Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) MacBooks in sales .

Microsoft has tried fighting back by helping manufacturers put out cheap Windows 10 laptops, but that hasn't stemmed the Chromebook flood. Windows 10 makes for a sluggish experience on inexpensive Intel hardware, it's far more complex than Chrome OS to use and lacks the drop-dead easy security of Chromebooks.

Windows 10 Cloud running on laptops with ARM processors would compete head-to-head with Chromebooks running Chrome OS: simpler, safer and cheaper than Windows 10.

Microsoft refused to comment on the ZDNet post, but the pieces pointing to Windows 10 as a Chrome OS-fighting, second crack at Windows RT make sense. Naturally, MSFT is going to avoid all references to Windows RT - that's poison - and the Windows 10 Cloud name could end up being a code name.

It could also be an attempt to steal some of the Chrome OS ""cloud"" thunder. Expect to get the final answer on Windows 10 Cloud from Microsoft prior to that April 17 Windows 10 Creators Build release.

Consumers are doing more and more web searches just by talking. And they're not just asking the digital assistants on their smartphones; they're also buying all-new devices, such as the Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) Echo and Google Home, to answer random queries.

For Google, the subsidiary of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) , the new trend in search is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it provides another point for users to interact with its product. On the other, Google doesn't have a stranglehold on the device market, and it isn't clear how companies can monetize voice search with ads.

Even as Google navigated the shift to mobile, it still fundamentally followed the same business model -- display ads within search results. That's not possible with voice searches.

But Google CEO Sundar Pichai isn't concerned. ""I see more opportunity than challenge, when I think about voice search,"" he told analysts on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call. I wouldn't be so sure he doesn't have that backward.

Losing the hardware battle

Google didn't provide any exact figures on the sales of its new Google Home device. Pichai did say that ""Google Home was a very popular present that many people opened on Christmas morning,"" but that was as detailed as he got.

RBC analyst Mark Mahaney suggests that Google is getting outsold 10-to-1 by competitors such as Amazon Echo. That presents a real challenge for Google, because without control over the hardware, it has no control over the user interface. That means all those potential voice searches will go to someone else.

Pichai points out that it's the very early days for devices such as Google Home. And Google does have one big advantage over Amazon and other competitors -- it's much better at search. ""When I look at what it would take to voice search well, our years of progress we have done in areas like natural language processing comes into play,"" Pichai said on the call. To his credit, Google Home has outperformed Alexa in many head-to-head search reviews.

But smart-speaker hardware is about more than search, and Amazon's Echo is capable of integrating with more devices and services than Google Home is. Google is certainly capable of overcoming that through more strategic partnerships, though. It just released a development kit for businesses to integrate with Google Home last month.

One area that will be harder to overcome is how well Amazon Echo works for Amazon Prime members. With tens of millions of Prime members around the world, it creates a pretty big moat for Google Home to cross.

But wait -- it gets tougher

Even if Google closes the gap in hardware sales, it still has to find a way to turn voice search into a business. Hardware sales won't move the needle for Alphabet, which generated over $90 billion in revenue last year.

What's more, Google has to sell the hardware near cost because its biggest competitor, Amazon, does the same. The margins on a Google Home device don't even come close to Google's 31% operating margin in the fourth quarter.

If Google is going to make some real money off of voice search, it needs to go beyond just getting its devices into people's homes. Google's best idea so far is to facilitate commerce through voice search . But if there's one company that has Google's number in e-commerce search, it's Amazon. Google will not win a battle against Amazon in developing a personal shopping assistant, no matter how good its search capabilities are.

Not just a challenge -- a threat

The growth of voice isn't just a challenge for Google. The shift to voice represents a threat, as it could result in a decline in the amount consumers use Google search, the company's cash cow.

Google is working to overcome the head start Amazon got in smart speakers, which accelerated the voice search trend. It plans to expand its hardware lineup and invest more in 2017. But as voice search continues growing and starts taking searches away from mobile and desktop, it will put pressure on Google to continue developing new higher-value display and search ads for its main desktop and mobile products.

This podcast was recorded on Jan. 19, 2017.

Sean O'Reilly: You mentioned how increasingly there's tech analysts there. It might be just a happy coincidence that it was right after CES [the Consumer Electronics Show]. Did it feel like a tech show when you were there?

John Rosevear: It has become really interesting. I didn't go to CES this year; we had other folks from The Fool who were out there. But CES -- the Consumer Electronics Show, which is in Vegas -- is also held usually the first week of January every year, has had more and more of an automotive focus. Ford CEO Mark Fields was out there. Mobileye and Delphi were demonstrating their new self-driving stuff out there. Fiat Chrysler showed off an electric concept minivan at CES. It's more and more focused on autos, future-tech autos.

Then the press days run up until Wednesday or Thursday of that week, and then everything starts in Detroit the following Sunday. It's just a couple days later; people fly straight in. This year, it was very notable -- it was almost as if that conversation was continuing on a separate track from the traditional show itself, where they're unveiling the latest minivan and all that kind of stuff.

We had John Krafcik, who heads up Waymo. Waymo is the company under the Alphabet umbrella formerly known as the Google Self-Driving Car Project. John Krafcik was in Detroit; he gave a presentation on Sunday afternoon talking about the state of Waymo's technology and what they're doing to test it and so forth. He was clearly there talking to the auto industry, talking to the automakers.

Waymo seems to be in ""let's make a deal"" mode right now. They showed off the test car they created with Fiat Chrysler, a Waymo-ized version of the Chrysler Pacifica minivan, which is already kind of futuristic and sexy-looking. It's kind of cool-looking; their self-driving sensors and stuff are much more smoothly integrated. You can still tell it's a test car, it still has this big thing on the roof. But it looks more like something you might see produced in the near future. They were running around with Toyota and Lexus and Audi test vehicles with stuff tacked on for years.

But anyway, to get back to the point, there was a steady discussion. Ford had a whole separate thing going on adjacent to the show where they had speakers on future mobility. Ford is trying to get into the business of helping cities come up with mobility plans as electric cars, self-driving, ride-sharing, and so forth become more prevalent and more affordable as technology advances. And this is a whole separate discussion that's going on throughout the show, aside from the traditional show itself, where automakers are showing off their new vehicles to the global media. It was really interesting, the way this is going. And there were several points in the show where I wished there had been two of me, because there were two things going on at the same time that I really wanted to attend.

Turnarounds usually aren't neat, orderly affairs, but Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD ) just keeps building momentum as the semidconductor firm continues to remake itself. Fourth-quarter earnings out Tuesday evening launched AMD stock by another 5% in after-hours trading, continuing a roughly yearlong run that hasn't seen much in the way of pullbacks.

For Q4, AMD posted an adjusted loss of 1 cent a share on revenues of $1.11 billion, which were up 15.4% year-over-year. While earnings were in line with Wall Street expectations, sales beat by about $40 million.

Also driving AMD stock higher was upbeat earnings guidance for the current quarter. Advanced Micro Devices forecasts revenues to range from $955 million to $1.02 billion. Using the midpoint, AMD would be looking at an 18% increase to $989 million - well above analyst expectations for $964 million.

Some additional highlights from AMD's fourth quarter:

The Computing and Graphics unit saw its revenues jump by 28% to $600 million.

The cash balance increased by $6 million, for a total of $1.26 billion.

The company announced the brand of its new chips, called Ryzen. One example of the technology's power: Combined with its Vega GPU, it allows a desktop to run Star Wars: Battlefront - Rogue One at 60 frames per second in 4K.

The company announced a collaboration with Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ) for the Radeon GPU technology for cloud computing.

(NASDAQ: , NASDAQ: ) for the Radeon GPU technology for cloud computing. AMD announced Radeon Instinct, which allows for high-end deep learning. The product is expected to hit the markets in the first half of this year.

AMD Is Primed for Growth

UDPATE: Management typically is conservative when it comes to earnings guidance, so we can anticipate nice traction in 2017, driven by Ryzen. For the most part, the technology looks like it has better performance and power usage compared to Intel Corporation's (NASDAQ: INTC ) 8-core, 3.2GHz Core i7-6900K that came out in May - and it's cheaper.

No surprise, then, that Alphabet has teamed up with AMD. But don't expect the large-cap tech partnerships to end there, and instead expect them to extend to the likes of Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) and Salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE: CRM )? Headline-making deals like this could very well drive AMD stock in 2017.

From CEO Lisa Su:

""As we enter 2017, we are well positioned and on-track to deliver our strongest set of high-performance computing and graphics products in more than a decade.""

So, should bulls exercise any caution?

Well, AMD stock has already staged an amazing rally, and yes, we probably won't see a repeat of 2016's triple-digit gains.

After all, Advanced Micro Devices' market cap is now close to $10 billion. Thus, it would need to generate a hefty $450 million in net earnings to get at a 25X multiple. But Wall Street frankly might not care.

AMD stock has become an excellent momentum play. Shares have become a way to play some of the hottest markets in technology, including augmented reality and artificial intelligence.

As long as growth keeps perking up, AMD still could have enough fuel to provide investors with market-beating returns.

AMD Stock Charts



Click to Enlarge If Tuesday's after-market results hold through Wednesday morning, AMD stock should bounce off its 50-day and 20-day moving averages to roughly $11. From there, shares would see price resistance at around $11.50, then $12 - its multiyear peak.

Meanwhile, AMD stock is far from gassed, with the Relative Strength Index coming in right around the center point at 50.

(RTTNews.com) - European markets are poised for a weak opening Monday following lackluster cues from Wall Street and Asia on some disappointing U.S. corporate earnings, weak GDP data and U.S. President Donald Trump's immigration ban.

Investors turned cautious as global leaders united to condemn Trump's latest executive order that blocks refugees from seven predominantly Islamic countries from entering the U.S. for a four-month period. These include Syria, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen.

The order has resulted in the detention and deportation of many arriving at U.S. airports, and huge protests in various cities. Trump defended the order, which was part of his campaign promise, saying that he aims to keep ""radical Islamic terrorists"" out of the country. However, the move adds to fears that his 'America First' policy likely destabilize other countries worldwide.

The Japanese market was notably lower following the mixed cues from Wall Street and on a stronger yen. The benchmark Nikkei 225 Index traded down 98.55 points or 0.51 percent to 19,368.85.

Australia's benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index closed at 5,661, down 0.92 percent. The all Ordinaries was down 0.89 percent at 5,714.

Elsewhere in Asia, the markets in South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, China and Hong Kong were closed for the Lunar New Year holidays.

In the currency market, the euro and pound gained against U.S. dollar by 0.3 percent and 0.2 percent, respectively on early Monday trading. The Aussie dollar gained against the U.S. dollar. The U.S. dollar traded in the mid 114 yen-range on Monday.

Among commodities, U.S. West Texas Intermediate or WTI Crude dropped 0.43 percent to $52.94 in early Asian deals.

Gold traded up 0.37 percent at $1,192.80 per ounce.

The major European markets turned in a mixed performance on Friday. France's CAC 40 Index slid by 27.26 points or 0.56 percent to 4,839.98 and Germany's DAX Index dipped by 34.36 points or 0.3 percent to 11,814.27, while the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index increased by 23 points or 0.32 percent to 7,184.49.

On Wall Street, stocks closed mixed on Friday, with relatively flat movement, as traders remained reluctant to make significant moves. The trading also reflected the mixed batch of earnings news released by several technology companies after the markets closed on Thursday.

The Nasdaq gained 5.61 points or 0.1 percent to a new record closing high of 5,660.68, while the Dow edged down 7.13 points or 0.04 percent to 20,093.78 and the S&P 500 dipped 1.99 points or 0.1 percent to 2,294.69.

Earnings were mixed, with Google's parent Alphabet reporting weaker than expected fourth quarter earnings, while, Intel and Microsoft both reported better than expected quarterly results.

(RTTNews.com) - Tesla Motors Inc. sued its former director of the Autopilot Programs, Sterling Anderson, for stealing company secrets and for luring away key staff.

In a filing last week in California, the car maker alleged that Anderson took proprietary information about the Autopilot program, and also recruited fellow Tesla employees for another autonomous driving company.

The lawsuit also named the former head of Google's autonomous car project, Chris Urmson, as a defendant. Tesla alleges that both executives attempted to start a company together, called Aurora.

In the filing Tesla alleges that Anderson, while working at the firm, installed hundreds of gigabytes of proprietary data from company computers on a personal hard drive, and tried to destroy evidence. The company also said that Anderson and Urmson attempted to poach at least 12 other Tesla employees, and successfully recruited two.

The lawsuit, filed in the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara, seeks exemplary and punitive damages of an unspecified amount. The company is also seeking an injunction to prevent the defendants from engaging in further unlawful and/or unfair business acts and practices directed at Tesla and its employees.

In response, Aurora reportedly said, ""Tesla's meritless lawsuit reveals both a startling paranoia and an unhealthy fear of competition. This abuse of the legal system is a malicious attempt to stifle a competitor and destroy personal reputations. Aurora looks forward to disproving these false allegations in court and to building a successful self-driving business.""

For the First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund ETF (Symbol: FDN), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $94.29 per unit.

With FDN trading at a recent price near $86.10 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.52% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of FDN's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Vonage Holdings Corp (Symbol: VG), Alphabet Inc (Symbol: GOOG), and EarthLink Holdings Corp (Symbol: ELNK). Although VG has traded at a recent price of $7.08/share, the average analyst target is 21.96% higher at $8.63/share. Similarly, GOOG has 19.84% upside from the recent share price of $823.31 if the average analyst target price of $986.67/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting ELNK to reach a target price of $7.60/share, which is 16.39% above the recent price of $6.53. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of VG, GOOG, and ELNK:

Combined, VG, GOOG, and ELNK represent 6.67% of the First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund ETF. Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:

Name Symbol Recent Price Avg. Analyst 12-Mo. Target % Upside to Target First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund ETF FDN $86.10 $94.29 9.52% Vonage Holdings Corp VG $7.08 $8.63 21.96% Alphabet Inc GOOG $823.31 $986.67 19.84% EarthLink Holdings Corp ELNK $6.53 $7.60 16.39%

Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

I recently wrote up two bullish trades to profit from Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ). Luckily, I caught an uptrend and the profits came quickly so I booked them. This week I want to reset to try and repeat performance - but this time I have an earnings report to worry about.

Source: Shutterstock

Traders are fickle around earnings. The short-term reaction to an earnings report is more gambling than investing, regardless of the quality of the report. Often enough great company stocks come under selling pressure even on solid reports.

FB stock is a mega cap and usually they takes cues from other mega cap earnings reactions. We recently saw a split decision between Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ).

Eventually these companies are winners; they are beasts with little chance of debacles. But for the short term, investors have to contend with the knee-jerk reactions.

Having said that, there are ways I can trade earnings reports without much out-of-pocket risk. Last week I sold puts in MSFT to buy its calls. The trade was an easy win.

This week, I will set up a trade to benefit from a positive reaction to FB's earnings. Experts think that Wall Street will not be impressed by what FB stock management has to report and that the risk is to the downside. I want to bet on the opposite but without much immediate risk.

FB Stock Trades



Click to EnlargeThe Trade: Buy Facebook Mar $135 calls. This is a bullish trade for which I pay $3 per contract to open. To profit, I need FB stock to rally past my strike before mid March. I could change this trade to a debit call spread to lower the entry cost. So I would instead buy the $135/$140 debit call spread and only spend $1.40 per contract. The trade-off is that with the spread, I cap my maximum profit to $3.60 per contract.

I usually like to lower my entry cost especially when volatility is high so I need to cautiously sell options.

The Bank: Sell the Facebook Dec $100 put. This is a bullish trade for which I collect $3.80 per contract. This trade has an 85% theoretical chance of success and a 18% price buffer from current price.

I only sell naked puts if I am willing and able to own the stock at the strike sold. IF FB stock falls below $100 per share this year I would be put the stock. Anything lower than $96 per share would be losses for me.

The Twist: Selling naked puts is not suited for every risk profile. So I can change the bank trade to being a credit put spread instead. Selling a spread makes the trade's maximum risk finite. For example, I can sell the FB Dec $100/$95 credit put spread. I collect $1.06 per contract to open. If successful, this trade yields 22% on money risked.

This is one of those occasions where I could do either or both. Some traders don't like selling risk into an earning report. I don't mind doing it with quality stocks like FB. I also usually do it far out in time and away from current levels.

I am not required to hold option trades through expiration. I can close them at any time for partial gains or losses.

Recently, one of HTC's former employees, Claude Zellweger, sent out a tweet ( reported by 9to5Google ) mentioning that he's left the company and is heading over to the Daydream virtual reality (VR) division run by Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google.

Zellweger led the team that designed HTC's high-end Vive VR headset and his move to Google's Daydream team is a strong indication that the company is getting even more serious about its mobile VR goals.

Why this matters

Google released its new Daydream View VR headset just a few months ago. The device is upgraded from the company's former Cardboard VR headsets that were (wait for it) made out of cardboard.

The View is an upgrade from the basic mobile VR unit and has a stylish design, soft-touch fabric, and a head strap to keep it on your head (most of the Cardboard versions had to be held up by hand). It also comes with a wireless remote that allows users to interact with VR content, like casting a fishing line, swinging a bat, or navigating around VR worlds.

In all, the View and its remote were a big step forward for Google as it launched its Daydream VR platform where users can access video content and VR games. But as much of a leap forward as the View was for Google's mobile VR plans, the Zellweger hire indicates that Google is already moving on to bigger plans.

Google already dominated sales of mobile VR headsets in 2016, according to SuperData research, and sold 20 times more of its headsets than all of its competitors combined. With this lead, and more focus on headsets seemingly coming, Google appears perfectly positioned to benefit from mobile VR for years to come. Using Zellweger to help expand into more VR headset designs -- or possibly bringing higher-end units to market -- could help Google set itself apart even more.

Mobile VR is one of the fastest-growing segments of virtual reality and is where most of the early VR user adoption will happen. Conservative estimates peg the VR market at around $30 billion by 2020, and higher estimates put it at $70 billion by the same time.

If we take the conservative estimate, about one-fifth of those revenues will come from hardware, while the rest will come from software. Google is clearly looking to lead in both the software and hardware segments with the Daydream platform and Daydream View, and adding more products, or slightly more expensive ones, could help lure more consumers into the market. Google's Daydream View costs just $49 right now, but a headset with more features could go for more.

It's still unclear how exactly Google plans to use Zellweger, but the hire is a clear indication that the company is already focusing on its next iterations of the Daydream View headset. That should help Google build on its already massive lead in the mobile VR headset space, and could eventually help bring more users to its Daydream platform.

Last September, Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR ) looked ripe for a buyout. Rumors leaked that salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE: CRM ) or Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ), among others, would buy the microblogging giant. Salesforce seemed the likely buyer, as it would have filled a void in the company's social networking.

Source: Christopher via Flickr

Once TWTR traders got hold of a possible bidding war, Salesforce did what was best for shareholders by dropping off the list of potential buyers.

Microsoft, meanwhile, went on to buy LinkedIn for $26.2 billion.

Renewed buyout hopes resurfaced this month, however, when Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ) said it would buy Fabric on Jan 18. So, why did Twitter not sell itself and give Fabric away for free?

Twitter's brand is powerful, but users are migrating from Facebook to Instagram and Snapchat . Fixing Twitter will require too much money and energy, even for a $550 billion dollar company like Alphabet, which simply does not have the appetite to compete against Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ).

But Fabric is a mobile developer platform whose strength is in performance tracking. Buggy apps get fixed fast on this platform, thanks to the superior bug reporting. By focusing on its core competency of mobile app development, Alphabet will continue finding growth in mobile.

Twitter's Cash Balance Goes Up

Twitter's sale of Fabric is puzzling because it does not need to sell assets to survive. The microblogging site generates positive cash flow, has over $5 a share in cash and trades at a book value of just 2.5 times. FB's price-book ratio is around seven.

When Twitter reports quarterly results on Feb. 9, it will likely report another quarter of positive FCF. Still, both GOOG and TWTR benefit from the Fabric sale. Twitter divests itself from a non-core business and Alphabet gains another tool for mobile.

Alphabet Buying TWTR Makes Sense

Twitter's real-time news and user post signals benefit Alphabet's search engine algorithm for news. Projected to report slowing growth in the next five years, GOOG has plenty of resources to make Twitter a better social network.

Bottom Line on TWTR Stock

Few shareholders have any faith Twitter's business will get better. Its CEO is only part-time and management is not capitalizing on shifting trends. This weakens TWTR against Instagram and Snapchat.

Management has lots of work ahead before remaking itself as a top destination for real-time news and commentary. Until the company wins back users from the other sites, TWTR stock will trade at a discount.

And it would be tough to argue with him. In 2016, Google parent Alphabet's revenue and profits increased, its core advertising business, non-advertising initiatives gained significant traction, and it wrapped up the year with two very successful Google-branded hardware launches. Here are eight facts to help capture Alphabet's business in 2016.

Google offices. Image source: Alphabet.

Total revenue increased 20% -- a notable acceleration from 14% year-over-year growth in 2015. And growth even picked up throughout 2016, with the company reporting 22% year-over-year growth in its fourth quarter, or 24% on a constant currency basis.

GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts .

Alphabet cited mobile search, YouTube, and programmatic advertising as key revenue drivers during the year.

Other bets revenue soared 82%, driven primarily by its smart home Nest products, Google Fiber internet, and Google's life science organization, Verily.

Still, other bets remain unprofitable. Indeed, the segment, which only represents about 1% of Alphabet's total revenue, lost $2.9 billion in 2016 when excluding stock-based compensation -- and this loss was on just $809 million in revenue. Including stock-based compensation, other bets operating loss was a whopping $3.6 billion.

Alphabet spent $3.7 billion repurchasing its own shares. As part of Alphabet's $7 billion repurchase program, the company's share repurchases in 2016 climbed higher. But investors shouldn't expect the share repurchase program to meaningfully reduce the company's shares outstanding, as Alphabet's stock-based award activities are almost just as aggressive . In 2016, Alphabet paid $3.3 billion in stock-based compensation.

Other revenue increased 41%. Not to be confused with Alphabet's much smaller other bets segment, the company's other revenue, which is made up of non-advertising Google products, was driven primarily by Alphabet's Google Play app store, hardware sales, and cloud businesses.

Alphabet introduced Waymo. Buried in Alphabet's other bets business, Alphabet's self-driving car technology development became a stand-alone business called Waymo .

""Waymo may be a new company, but we're building on advanced self-driving technology developed over many years at Google,"" said Waymo chief executive John Krafcik in a December blog post. Alphabet intends for Waymo to commercialize self-driving vehicle hardware and software, aiming to dramatically improve road safety.

In October, Alphabet launched a smart speaker and a smartphone. The company's voice-activated Google Home speaker and its new Google Pixel phone were clear successes this holiday season. While the company doesn't provide specific sales figures on the device, management did say it was ""thrilled with the reception"" for these devices, and that their success looks promising.

Google Home. Image source: Google.

Alphabet made significant progress in its cloud business. Management said in the company's fourth-quarter earnings call that its cloud business is on a ""terrific upswing."" With the help of Alphabet's well-timed $625 million acquisition of API provider Apigee, Alphabet made particular progress differentiating its Google Cloud Platform (GCP) by sharpening its offerings in data analytics, machine learning, security, and tools for application development. Further, in 2016, Alphabet's Google Cloud's G Suite product, which offers cloud-based collaboration and productivity applications, garnered more than three million paying customers by the end of the year.

Going into 2017, Alphabet will be up against a strong benchmark: itself. With a tough year-over-year comparison of 20% revenue growth in 2016, the company will need to continue executing well across Google advertising and YouTube, as well as its smaller businesses like hardware and cloud. Further, while Alphabet's other bets are still too small to help overall revenue growth in 2017, investors should continue to look for promising signs from the segment this year.

When Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) released its third-quarter earnings results, it announced plans to lay off 9% of its workforce. The move was part of an effort to become profitable in 2017. Twitter lost $103 million in the third quarter and $290 million through the first nine months of the year.

But Twitter's workforce isn't the only thing slimming down. Twitter is also laying off some of its underperforming products. The most recent is Fabric, Twitter's software development kit for mobile apps. Google -- the Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary -- is buying the business for an undisclosed amount. Twitter also shuttered Vine earlier this month as it focuses more on its core platform to generate a profit.

Twitter is having a fire sale

Rumors swirled for weeks last autumn ahead of Twitter's third-quarter earnings that Twitter was trying to sell itself. After failing to find a buyer, Twitter is faced with the reality that it needs to show it can become profitable in order to either attract better takeout offers or attract more interest on Wall Street.

It tried to sell off Vine, the six-second video app it bought and brought to market. Nobody bought it, so it had to shutter it. Google's interest in Fabric was fortuitous, considering Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) never found a buyer for its software development kit, Parse, and shuttered it last year.

Neither Fabric nor Vine ever generated revenue for Twitter. Both were designed to support the Twitter ecosystem, improving the functionality and engagement on the core platform. That didn't really happen, though, and Twitter's functionality and user base have remained the same for some time now.

Twitter still has various businesses that generate varying amounts of revenue. By and large they remain tied to its core platform. The only major exception is Periscope, its live-streaming app. The company just bought Periscope two years ago, but with the growth of live-streaming thanks in part to Facebook, it could likely find it a new home. Still, Twitter may be better off migrating Periscope's users to Twitter's new live-streaming feature and shuttering the original app.

Ultimately, Twitter seems intent on selling itself off piece by piece until all that remains is the core revenue generating businesses -- advertising and data licensing.

What is Twitter focused on for 2017?

Twitter seems most intent on growing video on its platform. Most recently, it signed a deal with Dick Clark Productions to live-stream the red carpet shows from various award shows later this year.

Twitter views premium event streaming as an opportunity to engage its light users. In its third-quarter letter to shareholders, Twitter noted that light users watched more Thursday Night Football than medium and heavy users. Increasing engagement among light and logged-out visitors is one of the biggest opportunities for Twitter to build engagement and acquire new users -- one it's been talking about for several years now.

Twitter also launched live video within its own app last month, a feature that lets anyone start streaming live. It basically does the exact same thing as Periscope, but it's more integrated with Twitter's main platform. Twitter was originally hesitant to merge the two products, but the success of Facebook Live may have swayed the product or management team.

Video was Twitter's top revenue-generating ad format in both the second and third quarters last year. Investors should expect continued efforts around delivering more organic video in a bid to attract more premium mobile video ad budgets. Twitter sees video ads as a much larger market than the generic social media advertising market.

An imperfect plan, but it just might work...kind of

Twitter appears hell-bent on meeting its goal of reaching profitability in 2017. It's reducing its workforce, cutting out overhead from products like Fabric and Vine, and investing all it can in premium video-streaming deals. After more than a year without significant user growth and slowing revenue growth, Twitter is officially exiting growth mode and focusing on the bottom line.

Twitter may very well turn a profit in 2017, but it's guaranteed to be a much smaller profit than investors initially expected when the stock went public three years ago. (Of course, that's reflected in the stock price.) Additionally, its ability to grow profits without a growing user base or product pipeline is questionable.

While management isn't wrong to start focusing on profitability, it seems to be thinking more short-term than long-term in order to reach a self-imposed goal. A goal, I might add, that seems more focused on finding a buyer than building real value for shareholders.

But there's one other item in the company's most recent quarterly report investors may want to take the time to consider: A key change in the way Alphabet will be calculating its non-GAAP results.

Image source: The Motley Fool.

Stock-based compensation to get the weight it deserves

In a surprising move, Alphabet explained in its fourth-quarter earnings call that it will no longer exclude stock-based compensation from its non-GAAP results. The change will weigh on non-GAAP earnings per share, but Alphabet believes it will give investors a better view of the company's regular operations.

Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat explained the change in the company's fourth-quarter earnings call.

[Stock-based compensation] (SBC) has always been an important part of how we reward our employees in a way that aligns their interests with those of all shareholders. Although it's not a cash expense, we consider it to be a real cost of running our business because SBC is critical to our ability to attract and retain the best talent in the world. Starting with our first quarter results for 2017, we will no longer regularly exclude stock­-based compensation expense from non­-GAAP results. Non­-cash stock­-based compensation will continue to be reported on our cash flow statement, but we will no longer be providing a reconciliation from GAAP to non­-GAAP measures that reflects SBC and related tax benefits.

The change sheds light on the growing cost of Silicon Valley-based talent for tech companies in the Bay Area. Stock-based compensation at companies such as Alphabet and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) have grown consistently in recent years, so much so that the two companies have recently announced share repurchase programs seeming to simply aim at offsetting the dilutive impacts of expected stock-based compensation.

To see what this growing stock-based compensation looks like, consider Alphabet and Facebook's stock-based compensation in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015.

Company Q3 2016 Q3 2015 YOY Change Alphabet $1.86 billion $1.4 billion 33% Facebook $2.91 billion $2.86 billion 5%

A precedent for other tech companies

As one of the biggest tech companies in the world, Alphabet, with the change to its non-GAAP reporting, highlights how regular stock-based compensation has become in Silicon Valley, and it sets a new precedent for other companies to make a similar change.

Image source: The Motley Fool.

Facebook could very well be one of the next big tech giants to make a similar move. And if it's not planning on making the same change soon, it should. The social network appears to be on the same page as Alphabet when it comes to expecting significant stock-based compensation in the years ahead. Facebook CFO David Wehner said in the company's third-quarter conference call that he ""anticipates 2017 will be an aggressive investment year.""

Wehner explained: ""Adding top engineering talent remains one of our key investment priorities as we continue to execute on our three-, five- and 10-year roadmap. We will continue to invest in our ability to recruit top technology talent both in the Bay Area and beyond.""

Almost certainly not a coincidence, Facebook announced a $6 billion repurchase program -- an authorization about equal to what the company will probably spend on share-based compensation in 2017 -- shortly after it said Bay Area hiring would drive an aggressive investment year for the company.

The bottom line? Bay Area share-based compensation expenses are growing in tandem with tech company revenues, and it's time for companies to stop excluding stock-based compensation from non-GAAP results -- starting with Alphabet, and maybe Facebook soon after.

When First Round Capital asked startup founders which company they most wanted to acquire their startup, they chose Alphabet more than any other company . Eleven percent of those surveyed voted for Alphabet , 5% chose Facebook, 4% chose Amazon and 4% chose Salesforce .

I recently spoke with Don Harrison, who heads up corporate development at the most significant part of Alphabet – the Google part. We discussed Google’s priorities, what Alphabet’s “new austerity” means for M&A, and whether artificial intelligence (AI) startups are selling snake oil. This interview has been lightly edited for clarity and length.

Alphabet did around 17 acquisitions in 2016 and in 2015. We didn’t see any big swings like we’ve seen in past years. What’s behind that, and should we expect more of the same this year?

In 2016, we’ll end up doing more than 20 deals. Generally speaking 2014 was a big year from a deal point of view. My team is still suffering from 2014. We generally take the same approach each year. Because we’re product-focused and product-driven, we’re reactive to the environment. When we see products or developments or large companies that are solving a problem in a new way, that drives M&A interest.

Whether its cloud, AI, hardware, Google Assistant, AR, VR, I expect next year to be a lot like this [past] year. The big swings tend to be lumpy. We could at any time do one of the larger deals but it wouldn’t surprise me if there is space between them.

Which of the sectors you just named are your priorities? Your competitors have been doing a lot of AI deals…

[Google CEO] Sundar [Pichai] has done a good job of bringing areas of focus too the company. We’re definitely AI first. We have been focused on that and we will continue to be. Cloud is a massive focus for us, and enterprise is an area of interest for us. With hardware and the Google Assistant– we’re looking for opportunities there. YouTube is always present for us. AR and VR continue to be investment areas.

How about valuations in AI? Is it overpriced?

It’s very hard to apply valuation metrics to AI. These acquisitions are driven by key talent -- really smart people. It’s an area I’m focused on and our team is focused on. The valuations are part and parcel of the promise of the technology. We pay attention to it but don’t necessarily worry about it.

A VC recently told me that AI and machine learning PhD students from Stanford and MIT are banding together and calling themselves companies without really even having an idea or product, as a way to sell themselves in high-priced talent acquisitions. Have you seen that?

These companies are very early stage and the techniques they’re using are not proven yet. The business models have still to come – so these are very early stage. And so I know you’re being humorous, but the universities are driving the talent.

When we do our diligence, we think about whether what they’re producing is worth the investment. And we now have really good people at the company focused on this, so our ability to sniff out in diligence a promising idea or approach versus companies that aren’t bringing a lot of value to the table is pretty good. But because we do investment after investment in this space and have assembled a pretty good team, these founders are excited to come work with us.

There’s a lot of talk about how the Alphabet restructuring and the hiring of CFO Ruth Porat brought a “new austerity” to the company. In that environment, a deal like YouTube or a hypothetical WhatsApp seems unlikely. Does it mean you’re being more disciplined with deals?

Looking at Sundar’s strategy on the Google side of things, I’ve only seen it grow in the areas we’re focused on and thinking about addressing. Looking at the strategy of the company, I think we’ve succeeded over the last year since we transitioned to Alphabet to be more disciplined about the bets we’re supporting. But our willingness to buy a DoubleClick, or a DeepMind, etc., I’ve only seen excitement about bringing those kinds of opportunities forward. We’ll be just as aggressive as we were in 2006 when we decided to buy YouTube.

There’s a lot of coop-etition going on lately. Alphabet now competes with its investment Uber, Uber merged with Didi, Didi has investment from SoftBank, SoftBank has Apple as one of its limited partners. It seems confusing, awkward, and full of potential conflicts of interest. How are you navigating that?

Competition between tech companies is still very much alive. I don’t think we could look at us and Amazon, Apple and Facebook and say there is a lessoning of competition. We seem to be competing as vigorously as we’ve always competed.

That being said, there is more opportunity – Uber is in transportation, telecoms like Verizon and AT&T are doing things that are getting them closer and closer to technology. You’re seeing a lot of these barriers starting to erode and break down and it’s a chance for competition and a chance for partnership. As technology disrupts, it breaks down these categories and that puts companies in competitive mode and opens the possibility for partnership.

It’s probably always been this complicated, but more lately we’ve seen technology companies wrestle with this competition. But it’s always been there. I think the introduction of some of the Chinese companies has increased the complications and made partnership both a possibility and something we need to think about.

With so much competition, do you consider doing deals to keep assets out of a competitor’s hands?

The rationales come up from time to time but my experience is that they don’t support deals. Generally speaking they provide something to think about, but if there isn’t a product thesis or fit, or we’re not excited about the founder coming to join Google, generally speaking, those aren’t deals that we pursue.

What did you learn from Nest and Dropcam deals?

I did both of those deals. I’m excited about the thesis behind them. All deals, all companies, all projects go through ebbs and flows in terms of success and failure, but the general thesis of a smart home is one I believe in strongly. I’m still excited and you see that kind of evolution with Google Home, Alexa and all of the current investments in a variety of smart home categories. I don’t know what lessons you mean, but I might not have learned the right ones.

I mean that there has been negative press about the companies after they were bought. Would you structure those deals differently now?

M&A will never be 100% successful and we learn from every deal we do, and so not to pick on any specific deal, but I’ve learned, based on relative success of deals we’ve done in the past, is making sure the key leaders at the company share a vision with the founder, making sure the strategy drives the M&A, as opposed to the M&A driving the strategy, and making sure we have good support mechanisms for these companies after they come in.

X is shutting down failed projects. Will we see divestitures?

I think Niantic [creator of the popular Pokemon Go game] is our most famous divestiture. [Laughs.]

We have done divestitures and I’m a fan of us thinking about that actively. Google is still very much in growth mode. When I look at Sundar’s and Alphabet’s strategy, I see broadening the vision. We should continue to make good bets across a variety of areas and recognize that some of those aren’t going to succeed and divestiture becomes a good home.

SketchUp [a 3D modeling business] is an example from [2012]. Niantic is a current example. I’d like to be open to this in the future. Discipline is important and divesting is a tool for that.

Many are expecting corporate tax holiday to drive M&A this year. Agree or disagree?

There’s been enough commentary on tax reform that we’ll be thinking about that this year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This Seeking Alpha breaking news item from January 26, 2017, summarizes the report with a couple statistics: the earnings per share of $9.36 missed consensus expectations by $0.26. The top line, at a little over $26 billion, beat by $830 million. The market traded the stock down at the time of this news item by 1.4%.

I get the trading aspect here, but I am a shareholder of Alphabet, and this doesn't impact my long-term thesis at all. Alphabet has a few important things going for it that will create value in the years ahead, making me happy to be patient and not at all discouraged by a negative reaction to Q4 (even if that negative reaction continues on in the trading sessions ahead).

Alphabet: It Knows Search Technologies And How To Monetize Them

Search engines are indispensable when using the Internet as a tool of research for any topic no matter the motivation (i.e., practical versus leisure), and Alphabet's Google search engine is the blue chip in the space. The company's algorithms are sophisticated and will increase in utility over time.

Alphabet has been very successful at making money from search with advertising. The Q4 press release states that the Google operating segment brought in $7.9 billion in income over the three-month period. For all of 2016, the company as a whole made $23.7 billion in operating income compared to $19.4 billion in 2015. Google search drives this company.

Why will Google grow? Mobile search will continue to be important in the coming years. It will expand as the culture remains on a post-desktop-PC course.

In addition, advertisers love how Google and its data help them make better choices in terms of targeting consumers. It's all about targeting, and search engines can deliver on this - especially Google's prime asset.

Also of note: advertisers need to reach web users. If the culture continues to use the web, then it does so at the expense of other media - this is well-known. An advertiser that wants to reach college kids may not want to advertise in a magazine or a late-night talk show. Instead, it will want to buy ads before a segment of video or on the home screen of big Internet portals. Other media are still important, but all of us are aware of how vital online properties have become in the lives of consumers.

This core search-engine asset will allow the company to engage other investment opportunities, as I will discuss in the next two sections.

Alpha(other)bet(s)

Google is key to the thesis, but Alphabet has a segment it calls Other Bets. This segment captures all the activity of the company's various experiments. For example, Google Fiber is an other bet.

Experimenting with different business models is another reason to own Alphabet. There's something very important to note: in the past, the company seemed to stress (in my opinion) risk taking in this area. Today, the perception is that the company wants to be disciplined about risk. This is exactly what a shareholder wants to hear. The company isn't planning to send people to Pluto or start a subscription service called YouTube Future that shows videos of events that will happen years from now. In my opinion, management wants to stress the practical aspects of experimentation and leave it to the other guy to create the first wormhole.

In a sense, by buying Alphabet you aren't just buying a great search engine but an overall managerial attitude that will serve investors well - be creative, but be prudent, always with an eye toward keeping the stock going. This attitude also is an asset, intangible though it may be. The memo here is clear: we want to expand, but we don't want to be the place where we throw valuable money at an impractical business-model fantasy. This CNBC article serves as a source for this idea. It mentions the fiber experiment - if one reads between the lines, one might come away with the notion that management realizes the challenged potential with the concept, and is acting properly to not allow the project to take up too much of the company's resources.

Future Acquisitions

Perhaps even most exciting is Alphabet's potential investment in acquisitions. There are many technologies the company will pursue in the next decade, but when you stop and think about it, probably the biggest thing that management will chase will be purchases relating to YouTube and its attempts at becoming a subscription service.

YouTube is a puzzling asset: it's immensely popular, it is ad-supported, but the company wants people to directly pay for it - hence the YouTube Red service. The latter is an experiment management must continue until it gets it correct. Advertising is a useful, justifiable way of monetizing the video site, but a subscriber-based approach is more attractive - having a mix of the two models will serve Alphabet well. However, the company will need to improve this segment via acquisition.

The market may in fact be signaling this. This article over at Recode wonders about the possibility of a tech business like Alphabet buying Sony Pictures (there is a rumor that Sony may want to sell this division).

At some point, Alphabet will make a big acquisition in this area. It will help the company sell subscriptions. Revenue from subscriptions is what a company that is based on giving out much of its stuff for free wants to achieve. When a merger for a concern such as Sony Pictures occurs, it will be good for the stock. Consolidation in the media space, the marriage between tech-data and intellectual properties in this new streaming age, is a theme that a lot of pundits promote. I agree with the theme, and I know I want to continue to own Alphabet ahead of the future acquisitions it makes for its search ambitions and for its YouTube services.

Big Risk: Watch Out For The Rest Of The FANG

The FANG stocks (thank you, Jim Cramer) are the risk here. FANG is Facebook (NASDAQ: FB), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) and Alphabet (i.e., G for Google).

Why do they constitute a risk? Simple: everything Alphabet wants to do they want to do. They are, in fact, doing it already. Think Facebook and Amazon don't fool around with search algorithms, or that Netflix isn't interested in the kind of data Alphabet is interested in? All of it is fair game. Who is to say Netflix won't fund its own Internet search engine once (or if) it turns extremely profitable from its own subscription service?

All of these tech companies want to do other things, explore their own other bets (maybe Netflix will one day have a show called Other Bets, about a strange tech company that funds all kinds of weird supernatural experiments; could be a sequel series to Stranger Things). They aren't sitting still, and that would be a concern to an investor.

Alpha(Long-Term)bet

Let's look at the following chart for Alphabet.

I can't predict the future with the above graphic. That isn't my intent. The past oftentimes may not mean a whole lot.

Nevertheless, investors always look at the past. It's another data point, for better or for worse. To me, the trend at least tells me that the stock has been heading in the right direction and that the market seems to have confidence, to one debatable degree or another, in the company and its management team.

As I check other Seeking Alpha articles, I note the bullish sentiment. This article by D.M. Martins Research goes into helpful detail on the other-bets category - read it just for that. But I wanted to mention that the author mentions the possibility of a $1,000 stock price at some future trading date. Stone Fox Capital likewise threw that number into the discussion.

Sometimes a lot of agreement on a stock can be a troubling thing (if you want to see some of the cons to the latest earnings report, read this article), but I honestly believe that Alphabet shares will eventually get to this price. The combination of search, speculative investments and an eventual acquisition strategy will support the stock on such a run-up to that level.

Alphabet, in my opinion, is a buy for the long-term portfolio in need of some exposure to the technology sector. As always, perform your own due diligence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(GOOGL), and see some interesting trends in the stock’s behavior of late. In the end, it’s all about what a stock does that matters. In the case of this particular stock, the chart tells quite a story at present.

GOOGL has been trading in a bearish trend, based on the relative levels of its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages. This suggests that the broad sum of capital flow in the stock has been generally negative over the recent period. In terms of the relative level of interest afforded this stock among active participants in the market, relative volume measures have been weak, indicating apathy for the name by traders, investors, and money managers during the past month of action. This suggests something of the significance of other current technical measures as well.

For market timers, it’s also important to take measure of the relative level of recent lift or pressure in the stock is it overbought or oversold? For that, we turn to RSI and stochastic measures. The 14-day RSI stands at 62.31%. That shows that the stock, according to a traditional interpretation and usage of the RSI indicator, is not particularly predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure If we look at the stochastic measure, the raw data over the stock’s last month of action shows a score of 88.49%. Based on a raw data interpretation, the stock is relatively overbought from this perspective.

It should be noted that the overall volatility in the stock is worth gauging as well. In recent action, GOOGL has made a move of +40.46 over the past month. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by -0.66%, and it’s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. The stock’s recent movement has come on a historical volatility score of 13.81%, which represents the standard deviation of returns of a theoretical long position from a mean price during that period. On a daily basis over the past month, the average true range of the stock, as expressed in percentage terms, is 1.4%. That should give you a pretty good sense of the level of risk implied in a short-term trading approach in the stock with a stop-loss in place.

As it stands at present, the stock might find important action at key Fibonacci levels. Fibonacci levels are used by major Wall Street firm technical desks. The math is drawn from the Fibonacci series that defines growth systems by an interval increase characterized by steps divisible by the “golden ratio” of 61.8%. In this case, the critical 38.2% level drawn off the 52-weeklow of $672.66 sits at $744.61. GOOGL also has additional support below at the stock’s 200-day simple moving average, which sits at $777.51.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And it would be tough to argue with her. In 2016, Google parent Alphabet's revenue and profits increased, its core advertising business, non-advertising initiatives gained significant traction, and it wrapped up the year with two very successful Google-branded hardware launches. Here are eight facts to help capture Alphabet's business in 2016.

Total revenue increased 20% -- a notable acceleration from 14% year-over-year growth in 2015. And growth even picked up throughout 2016, with the company reporting 22% year-over-year growth in its fourth quarter, or 24% on a constant currency basis.

Alphabet cited mobile search, YouTube, and programmatic advertising as key revenue drivers during the year.

Other bets revenue soared 82%, driven primarily by its smart home Nest products, Google Fiber internet, and Google's life science organization, Verily.

Still, other bets remain unprofitable. Indeed, the segment, which only represents about 1% of Alphabet's total revenue, lost $2.9 billion in 2016 when excluding stock-based compensation -- and this loss was on just $809 million in revenue. Including stock-based compensation, other bets operating loss was a whopping $3.6 billion.

Alphabet spent $3.7 billion repurchasing its own shares. As part of Alphabet's $7 billion repurchase program, the company's share repurchases in 2016 climbed higher. But investors shouldn't expect the share repurchase program to meaningfully reduce the company's shares outstanding, as Alphabet's stock-based award activities are almost just as aggressive. In 2016, Alphabet paid $3.3 billion in stock-based compensation.

Other revenue increased 41%. Not to be confused with Alphabet's much smaller other bets segment, the company's other revenue, which is made up of non-advertising Google products, was driven primarily by Alphabet's Google Play app store, hardware sales, and cloud businesses.

Alphabet introduced Waymo. Buried in Alphabet's other bets business, Alphabet's self-driving car technology development became a stand-alone business called Waymo.

""Waymo may be a new company, but we're building on advanced self-driving technology developed over many years at Google,"" said Waymo chief executive John Krafcik in a December blog post. Alphabet intends for Waymo to commercialize self-driving vehicle hardware and software, aiming to dramatically improve road safety.

In October, Alphabet launched a smart speaker and a smartphone. The company's voice-activated Google Home speaker and its new Google Pixel phone were clear successes this holiday season. While the company doesn't provide specific sales figures on the device, management did say it was ""thrilled with the reception"" for these devices, and that their success looks promising.

Alphabet made significant progress in its cloud business. Management said in the company's fourth-quarter earnings call that its cloud business is on a ""terrific upswing."" With the help of Alphabet's well-timed $625 million acquisition of API provider Apigee, Alphabet made particular progress differentiating its Google Cloud Platform (GCP) by sharpening its offerings in data analytics, machine learning, security, and tools for application development. Further, in 2016, Alphabet's Google Cloud's G Suite product, which offers cloud-based collaboration and productivity applications, garnered more than three million paying customers by the end of the year.

Going into 2017, Alphabet will be up against a strong benchmark: itself. With a tough year-over-year comparison of 20% revenue growth in 2016, the company will need to continue executing well across Google advertising and YouTube, as well as its smaller businesses like hardware and cloud. Further, while Alphabet's other bets are still too small to help overall revenue growth in 2017, investors should continue to look for promising signs from the segment this year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1/27/2017,0.520748106,0.103433442,834.71,841.95,820.44,823.31,2965771,21.51,-11.4,0,"For at least several months before Alphabet splintered off its car division and named it Waymo, the company had made it clear that it did not want to build a car. Instead, Waymo’s strategy was to work on developing the brains of the emerging self-driving industry’s cars instead.

They were building the driver, executives had said time and time again. Today, that may mean one of Waymo’s new ambitions is to provide the complete technological platform to the automakers making self-driving vehicles.

It’s not entirely clear when the plan shifted, but the new tack easily jibes with Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat’s directive to meet specific financial targets for the company’s sometimes wayward experiments, known as moonshots. It’s not as sexy as building a car, but it’s a quicker way to realize revenue from a new industry.

Building parts isn’t as sexy as building a car, but it’s a quicker way to realize revenue from a new industry.

The first indication that Waymo was positioning itself as a competitor to players like Mobieleye and Delphi came in December, when CEO John Krafcik announced the company was going to build its own sensor technology, the proverbial eyes that self-driving vehicles need to track the road and any obstacles such as oncoming traffic or pedestrians.

But the real key is that the hardware would be far cheaper than what was currently available. Specifically, Krafcik said the company found a way to bring down the cost of a crucial technology that it once sourced from third-party suppliers: The laser-based radar.

When the company first built its own self-driving prototype it cost $75,000. A combination of altering the design and bringing the production in-house allowed the company to bring that cost down 90 percent, according to Krafcik.

At the time, Krafcik said selling its hardware to automakers was a possibility.

“Having our hardware and software development under one roof is incredibly valuable,” Krafcik said during his keynote at the AutoMobili-D conference in Detroit. “Our sensors are developed in close collaboration with our software experts who specialize in AI techniques like machine learning. A single integrated system means that all the different parts of our self-driving technology work together seamlessly.”

Waymo’s relationship with automakers will likely be different than that of a traditional supplier. One version of that relationship is its partnership with Fiat Chrysler, for which the two companies collaborate on building the vehicle but they are owned and operated by Waymo.

Suppliers, on the other hand, simply deliver its hardware or software to automakers which then integrate it into the vehicles during production.

Car companies typically have to seek many different supply chains, roughly breaking down into hardware and software. Waymo is betting that by building both the hardware and software into one system, it can make the technology more valuable. It’s easier, for instance, to negotiate one deal than multiple agreements. As Krafcik said in his keynote, the software and hardware are also more closely integrated.

Already, the company is being mentioned in the same breath as the players it wants to beat. On Ford’s quarterly earnings call Thursday, an analyst asked whether Ford would consider sharing data with suppliers like Waymo or Mobileye to create standardized HD maps for the industry. Ford CEO Mark Fields responded the company would have to determine whether it’s ceding a competitive advantage to other automakers by sharing the data.

Still, that doesn’t mean it’s in the bag for Waymo.

For one, we’ve seen a number of suppliers that automakers are already working with strike up partnerships in the last few months.

In August, Delphi and Mobileye (which supplies sensor technology) announced the companies were partnering to develop a fully self-driving system that automakers can begin to integrate into their vehicles in 2019. BMW has already said it will integrate that system into a fleet of its vehicles.

Chipmaker Nvidia also announced it would begin working with hardware suppliers Bosch and ZF and would power Audi’s self-driving system.

More importantly, automakers have had long-standing relationships with these suppliers. It’s a close network that is difficult to infiltrate, one insider argued. Yet another said there are still opportunities. Tesla, for instance, stopped working with Mobileye after a fatal car crash.

“Every automaker works with hundreds of suppliers,” the source said. “So I don’t think it’s fair to say that they wouldn’t drop one [company] in favor of another.”

But perhaps the biggest obstacle for Waymo is that it is owned by Google’s parent company Alphabet. Automakers have long steered clear of partnering with consumer-facing companies like Apple and Google for fear of ceding their in-car experience and brand. Traditional suppliers like Bosch and Delphi are generally known only to gear-heads and mechanics.

It’s why, many sources say, few carmakers were initially willing to partner with Google or even Uber on the companies’ respective self-driving efforts. They didn’t want to simply bend metal for what would inevitably become seen as the Google or Uber car.

But when Krafcik officially unveiled Waymo to the world, he repeatedly referred to the vehicles the company’s technology will power as “our” cars.

“Our next step as Waymo will be to let people use our vehicles to do everyday things like run errands, commute to work, or get safely home after a night on the town,” he said.

It’s semantics, certainly. But it’s a departure from the way most suppliers operate: Behind the scenes.

It’s unclear that Waymo would be willing to work quietly under the hood. So while there’s a substantial value proposition in developing the full stack of technology in house, it’s not the only thing that matters to automakers when determining which players to partner with.

Update: The headline was updated to reflect that Waymo will be taking on suppliers, not becoming a traditional supplier.

The company's mammoth advertising and search businesses take center stage as the main bread winners, but analysts want to hear more about Google's ""other"" businesses—especially cloud computing.

For the fourth quarter ending December 31, 2016, the non-advertising business—which includes Google Cloud Platform along with Google's popular G Suite software as well as hardware like the Pixel phone—hit $3.4 billion in sales, up 62% from the year-ago period. That business represents a bigger piece of total Google ( goog ) revenue—13% compared to 10% from last year's quarter.

Analysts want specifics on just how well the cloud business is doing, but no one outside Google knows how much of that sales total comes from Google Cloud. During Thursday night's call, Google chief executive Sundar Pichai boasted Google Cloud Platform is on a ""terrific upswing"" and has ""moved beyond table stakes,"" according to trade publication CRN.

Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.

More specifics would be helpful because cloud computing is a fast-growing market. More businesses are putting new applications onto shared data center infrastructure run by an outside cloud provider rather than building more of their own facilities, which is, to say the least, expensive. And they usually end up buying computing capacity that they may use once or twice a year. The public cloud model that Amazon ( amzn ) Web Services started to popularize in 2006 lets them ramp up computing power when needed and then shut it down—and stop paying for it as needed.

Market research firm IDC estimates that public cloud spending worldwide—now just under $100 billion—will double by 2020. Granted, that's a tiny piece of the estimated $2.4 trillion spent on IT worldwide as of 2016. But public cloud outlays are expected to eclipse spending on hardware and software that companies run on-site.

After the earnings call, market analyst firm TBRI said it expects the Google Cloud group to keep pushing its advantage in data analytics and machine learning to compete with rivals AWS, Microsoft ( msft ) Azure. and IBM ( ibm ) Bluemix.

For more on Google Cloud. watch:

Bottom line: Google has work to do. For its last quarter, AWS sold $3.2 billion worth of cloud services . Microsoft Azure, while it lags AWS by quite a bit, is tapping into a big pool of existing Windows-and-Office business customers.

Google Cloud has a few Fortune 500 accounts including Whirlpool ( whr ) and Airbus ( airbus.group-n-v ) but has thus far struggled to gain more traction in big businesses. Alphabet and Google executives—including Pichai, senior vice president Diane Greene, vice president Brian Stevens, and Alphabet executive chairman Eric Schmidt—will headline a Google Cloud Next event in March. Expectations are that they will announce more corporate accounts for Google Cloud Platform at that time.

Over the last eight years, the company was closely associated with former President Barack Obama. Google employees overwhelmingly supported Mr. Obama’s presidential campaigns, and some later took roles in his administration. Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, advised the Obama White House. And last year, Google employees gave $1.3 million to Hillary Clinton’s campaign to succeed Mr. Obama, compared with $26,000 to the Trump campaign, according to federal filings.

Now, the tech giant is scrambling to forge ties with Mr. Trump’s new administration and to strengthen its relationship with a Republican-dominated Congress. Most important, Google is trying to change the perception that it is a Democratic stronghold.

That has led to events like the party at the Smithsonian, which the institution said had cost at least $50,000. Mr. Schmidt has embarked on an East Coast charm offensive of Republican political leaders, including twice visiting Mr. Trump and his advisers at Trump Tower. Last month, Google also posted an opening to fill a position for a “conservative outreach” employee in its Washington office.

“Google has a target on its back because it is fundamentally viewed as a Democratic company,” said Gigi Sohn, a former senior adviser to Tom Wheeler, who was chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. “Even though it has reached out to Republicans, it can’t shake the image.”

Google said it had long had Republican lobbyists and had not changed its strategy.

“We’ve worked with both Republicans and Democrats for over a decade, advocating policies to encourage economic growth, innovation and entrepreneurialism,” the company said in a statement. “We’ll continue to do exactly that.”

A spokesman for Mr. Schmidt added, “Eric has a long record of working constructively and energetically on important technology issues with American and world leaders across the political spectrum.”

Other Silicon Valley tech companies, like Facebook, are in a similar predicament. The perception is that they lean left and their executives backed Mrs. Clinton. Many are now also pledging to work with Mr. Trump and paid court to the new president at a December tech summit meeting.

One week into the administration, Google and other tech companies began to push back, criticizing Mr. Trump’s executive order on immigration bans. The company said an estimated 187 employees were affected by the order and it urged any of those employees who were abroad to work with the company to return safely to the United States.

”It’s painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues,” Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, said in a memo to employees over the weekend. “We’ve always made our views on immigration issues known publicly and will continue to do so.”

Google has much at stake as it repositions itself. During the Obama years, Google avoided American antitrust charges, even as European regulators accused the firm of antitrust violations in search and in its mobile business. Google also successfully pushed a policy agenda that included the creation of net neutrality rules in 2015 and the defeat of online piracy laws in 2012.

Now warning shots against Google have been fired by those in Mr. Trump’s circle. Some of the president’s advisers have debated whether the tech behemoth deserves more antitrust scrutiny, according to two people briefed by the new administration’s transition team, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

In a recent interview with The New York Times, Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist and Trump transition adviser, also compared the power that Google had under Mr. Obama to that which the oil giant Exxon Mobil had under President George W. Bush. Under President Bush, the administration largely agreed with Exxon’s skeptical stance on climate change policy.

Mr. Trump’s team is particularly wary of one Google executive — Mr. Schmidt — who has been allied with Democrats. During last year’s presidential campaign, Mr. Schmidt counseled Mrs. Clinton on strategy.

Mr. Trump’s advisers, including his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, have complained about Mr. Schmidt’s funding of a start-up called the Groundwork, which provided data and other technology for Mrs. Clinton’s campaign. They also suspected Google was skewing search results in favor of Mrs. Clinton, said Barry Bennett, a former senior adviser for Mr. Trump’s campaign.

“Mr. Schmidt spent millions and millions of his personal money to defeat Donald Trump,” Mr. Bennett said. “It takes a particular amount of gumption to pretend that never happened.”

Google has denied it tweaked its search results, which are determined by algorithms, and the company declined to comment on Mr. Schmidt. White House officials did not respond to a request for comment.

For many years, Google’s support of Democrats was plain. Google’s political action committee and employees ranked third in all donations to Mr. Obama’s 2012 campaign at $804,240, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. In 2008, Google’s PAC and employees were sixth with $817,855. The company did not rank in the top 20 for donations to Mr. Obama’s Republican opponents in either of those elections.

About five years ago, Google began diversifying its bets. The company forged ties with the Republican-dominated House of Representatives and started addressing the beginning of an antitrust investigation into whether the company was using its search dominance to suppress competing travel, map and restaurant sites.

In 2011, Google hired Stewart Jeffries, a former member of the House Judiciary Committee, to lobby Republicans on Capitol Hill. That same year, it quadrupled its number of outside lobbying firms — including many with Republican lobbyists — to 24, from six in 2010. In 2012, Google named a former Republican congresswoman, Susan Molinari of New York, to lead its Washington office.

Google also sponsored conservative think tanks such as the American Enterprise Institute and the Heritage Foundation. The company has hosted Republican lawmakers including the House majority leader, Kevin McCarthy of California, and Darrell Issa of California at its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif.

Google’s Washington office is now roughly split between Republican and Democrats. The company spent $15.43 million in lobbying in 2016, according to federal lobbying documents, making it among the top dozen firms in lobbying spending last year. For the first time last year, Google’s PAC gave more to Republican congressional candidates than to Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

Even so, Google’s Republican ties got little notice because of the company’s strong relationship with Democrats. Several Google employees joined the Obama administration while dozens of government bureaucrats were employed by the tech company. Google’s head of global public policy, Caroline Atkinson, was Mr. Obama’s former national security adviser. A former Google executive, Megan Smith, became the nation’s chief technology officer.

During his presidency, Mr. Obama also repeatedly supported proposals backed by Google, including net neutrality in 2015 and cable set-top box reforms last year.

“Google was very much treated as the golden child by the Obama administration,” said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, which has been critical of Google for privacy policies.

Since the election, Google has accelerated efforts to win over the Republican White House and Congress. Before his visits to Trump Tower, Mr. Schmidt met with Mr. McCarthy and Senator John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, who is chairman of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.

Days after Mr. Trump’s victory, Google also contacted The Independent Journal Review, which it had worked with on events during the Republican campaign debates. Google told the news start-up that it would provide the main funding for the party at the Smithsonian.



Google said the event was open to both parties. But pairing with the conservative site sent a clear message to attendees. “We definitely helped draw Republicans and people from across the spectrum,” said the site’s founder, Mr. Skatell.

At the party, several Republican lawmakers were positive about their tech host, brushing off questions about the company’s heft and power.

“When I think of technology and Google, I don’t think of dominance,” said Representative Bradley Byrne, a Republican from Alabama. “I think of innovation.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1/27/2017,0.351334158,0.006393501,834.71,841.95,820.44,823.31,2965771,21.51,-11.4,0,"After the close of trading last night, Google reported results for its quarter that ended in December came in well ahead of revenue estimates, but ""missed"" on the bottom-line. The company reported revenues of $26.1 billion, up 22% year on year or 24% on a constant currency basis. Revenues of $26.04 billion beat consensus of $25.2 billion by roughly $840 million. However, Street consensus for earnings for Q4:16 was $9.67 per share and Google reported $9.36 per share.

So how does the company beat by such a wide margin on the top line but miss on the bottom line? Any rational investor would surmise the company should have had a big beat on the bottom line, as well.

However, normalcy does not count whereas Google is concerned. Maybe, the shine is also wearing off Ruth Porat, the highly regarded ""Wall Street"" CFO of Google.

First and foremost, the company said that in the December quarter they did not buy back even one measly share of stock, citing some vague ""quiet period"" excuse, despite the stock getting beat down to a low of $735 per share intra-quarter.

The company spent $3.7 billion in share buybacks in 2016, but the share count for the year actually increased by 3.2 million shares to 700 million thanks to the 17% increase in headcount last year.

Google ended 2016 with over $86 billion in cash and cash equivalents. If the company had decided to just spend $2.4-$2.5 billion more on share buybacks last year, the share count would have remained flat on the year.

The company added over 10,000 employees in 2016. That's an increase in headcount of almost 17% and also went a long way in the increasing share count despite the buyback in the first 9 months of the year.

Secondly, the company continues to spend heavily in its other bets segment and showed a loss of $927 million for the December quarter in that segment. Losses are decreasing year on year, but not at a fast enough clip to positively impact earnings. The company is making the right moves in its other bets by selling off parts (Terra Bella to Planet) and opening other parts to outside investments, like the company just announced with Temasek and Verily.

In the December quarter, Google was able to lessen the losses from its other bets segment by $144 million to $927 million. Nonetheless, that is almost a billion dollars in losses from moonshots and other bets that is creating these quarterly hits and misses for Google from quarter to quarter.

Guess who pays the piper?

You got it!

It's you and I, the shareholders, that pay the price for the company's free-spending ways on projects that are near and dear to Sergey and Larry.

After the results were out last night, shares of Google were lower by about 3% and at the moment (early pre-market) are indicated lower by roughly 2%. The percentage indicated lower is not meaningful enough if one is just long stock, however, the point is that this ""miss"" could have been easily prevented had Google management just spent a little more on the share buybacks and a little less on its other bets.

Having said all that, what's the move going forward?

It is clear that despite its gigantic size, business is booming at Alphabet and there is no slowdown on the horizon or at least for the foreseeable future.

My plan is to judiciously and cautiously increase my core position in Google, maybe even as soon as today itself. After all, there is no earnings risk until next quarters results.

In addition, if Google's ""earnings miss"" creates a sell-off in the other members of the FANG quartet (especially the two that have not yet reported earnings for their respective December quarters), it could be an opportunity to maybe add to those positions as well.

Investors who are panicked into selling their shares this morning despite Google beating revenues by almost a billion dollars could be losing sight of the opportunity given the noisy headlines regarding a ""miss on earnings"" that really isn't a miss and the constant all-pervasive negativity that seems to be the only thing consistent in our markets.

(RTTNews.com) - Following the lackluster performance in the previous session, stocks may continue to show a lack of direction in early trading on Friday. The major index futures are currently pointing to a roughly flat open for the markets, with the Dow futures down by just 12 points.

Traders may remain reluctant to make significant moves amid uncertainty about the near-term outlook for the markets following recent strength.

The Dow ended the previous session at a new record closing high, while the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 remained close to the record highs set on Wednesday.

While Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) reported weaker than expected fourth quarter earnings, Intel ( INTC ) and Microsoft ( MSFT ) both reported better than expected quarterly results.

In economic news, the Commerce Department released a report showing economic growth in the U.S. slowed by more than anticipated in the final three months of 2016.

The report said gross domestic product increased by 1.9 percent in the fourth quarter following a 3.5 percent jump in the third quarter. Economists had expected GDP to climb by 2.2 percent.

A separate report from the Commerce Department showed durable goods orders unexpectedly declined in December amid a continued decrease in orders for transportation equipment.

The Commerce Department said durable goods orders fell by 0.4 percent in December after tumbling by a revised 4.8 percent in November.

The dip came as a surprise to economists, who had expected durable goods orders to jump by 2.6 percent following the 4.5 percent slump that had been reported for the previous month.

However, excluding the drop in orders for transportation equipment, durable goods orders rose by 0.5 percent in December after jumping by 1.0 percent in November. The increase matched estimates.

Shortly after the start of trading, the University of Michigan is scheduled to release its revised report on consumer sentiment in the month of January.

The consumer sentiment index is expected to be unchanged from the preliminary reading of 98.1, which was down slightly from 98.2 in December.

After moving notably higher over the two previous sessions, stocks showed a lack of direction throughout the trading day on Thursday. Despite the choppy trading on the day, the Dow still ended the session at a new record closing high.

The major averages eventually ended the day mixed. While the Dow rose 32.40 points or 0.2 percent to 20,100.91, the Nasdaq edged down 1.16 points or less than a tenth of a percent to 5,655.18 and the S&P 500 dipped 1.69 points or 0.1 percent to 2,296.68.

In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly higher during trading on Friday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index rose by 0.3 percent, while Australia's All Ordinaries Index advanced by 0.7 percent. The Chinese markets were closed on the day.

Meanwhile, the major European markets are turning in a mixed performance on the day. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index has inched up by 0.2 percent, the German DAX Index is down by 0.2 percent and the French CAC 40 Index is down by 0.4 percent.

In commodities trading, crude oil futures are slipping $0.18 to $53.60 a barrel after jumping $1.03 to $53.78 a barrel on Thursday. Gold futures are currently trading at $1,181.30 an ounce, down $8.50 from the previous session's close of $1,189.80 an ounce. On Thursday, gold fell $8.

On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 115.28 yen compared to the 114.50 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Thursday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.0695 compared to yesterday's $1.0682.

(RTTNews.com) - Stocks are turning in another lackluster performance in morning trading on Friday after ending the previous session mixed. The major averages are once again showing only modest moves on the day.

Currently, the major averages are just below the unchanged line. The Dow is down 6.58 points or less than a tenth of a percent at 20,094.33, the Nasdaq is down 0.33 points or less than a tenth of a percent at 5,654.84 and the S&P 500 is down 1.92 points or 0.1 percent at 2,294.76.

The continued lack of direction on Wall Street comes as traders remain reluctant to make significant moves amid uncertainty about the near-term outlook for the markets following recent strength.

The markets are also digesting the mixed batch of earnings news released by several big-name technology companies after the close of trading on Thursday.

While Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) reported weaker than expected fourth quarter earnings, Intel ( INTC ) and Microsoft ( MSFT ) both reported better than expected quarterly results.

In economic news, the Commerce Department released a report showing economic growth in the U.S. slowed by more than anticipated in the final three months of 2016.

The report said gross domestic product increased by 1.9 percent in the fourth quarter following a 3.5 percent jump in the third quarter. Economists had expected GDP to climb by 2.2 percent.

However, economists noted that the slowdown was largely due to the impact of fluctuations in trade and said the third and fourth quarters together indicate a strong second half.

(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) were down nearly 3% in Thursday's after-hours trading after the internet search giant released fourth-quarter 2016 results. But keeping in mind Alphabet stock opened the trading session at a fresh all-time high, as well as the fact that it doesn't provide specific quarterly financial guidance, the market's response isn't necessarily indicative of a disappointing quarter.

Let's take a closer look at what drove Alphabet's latest results.

Alphabet's headline numbers

Quarterly revenue climbed 22.2% year over year (24% at constant currency), to $26.064 million, and -- based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) -- translated to 23.4% growth in operating income, to $6.639 billion, and 8.3% growth in GAAP net income, to $5.333 billion. GAAP net income per share grew 7.1%, to $7.56, for both Class A and Class B shares.

On an adjusted (non-GAAP) basis, which adds perspective by excluding items like stock-based compensation, operating income grew 24.5% year over year, to $8.485 billion, net income grew 9.1%, to $6.593 billion, and net income per share grew 8%, to $9.36. By comparison -- and though we don't usually pay close attention to Wall Street's quarterly demands -- analysts' consensus estimates called for higher adjusted earnings of $9.64 per share but more modest 18.3% growth in revenue, to $25.23 billion.

CFO Ruth Porat added:

Our growth in the fourth quarter was exceptional [...]. This performance was led by mobile search and YouTube. We're seeing great momentum in Google's newer investment areas and ongoing strong progress in Other Bets.

More specifically, here's a broad look how Alphabet's two primary operating segments (Google and ""other bets"") fared:

Metric Three Months Ended Dec. 31, 2015 Three Months Ended Dec. 31, 2016 Year-Over-Year Growth Google segment revenues $21.179 billion $25.802 billion 21.8% Google operating income $6.744 billion $7.883 billion 16.9% Other bets revenues $150 million $262 million 74.7% Other bets operating income (loss) ($1.213 billion) ($1.088 billion) N/A

DATA SOURCE: ALPHABET, INC.

On Google

Alphabet's core Google business -- which includes the likes of Search, Android, Maps, Chrome, YouTube, Google Play, and Gmail, as well as Ads, Commerce, Apps, Cloud, and hardware products -- predictably represented the bulk of the company's consolidated revenue.

Within that, advertising revenue climbed 17% year over year, to $22.4 billion, or roughly 85.9% of Alphabet's total revenue (down from 88.3% last quarter, and just over 89% two quarters ago). Breaking it down further, ad revenue from Google's own properties climbed 20% year over year, to $17.968 billion, and ad revenue from network members' properties rose 7%, to $4.431 billion.

Aggregate paid clicks increased 36% year over year, including 43% growth in paid clicks on Google properties, and 7% growth in paid clicks on Google network members' properties. Meanwhile, aggregate cost-per-click -- a key measure that helps show how much Google makes per ad -- declined 15%, including 16% and 19% declines on Google properties and network members' properties, respectively. As I noted in my earnings preview earlier this week, declines in aggregate cost-per-click continue to stem from outsized growth at YouTube, where TrueView ads tend to reach consumers earlier in the purchase funnel so monetize at lower rates.

Finally, other revenue within Google grew an impressive 62% year over year, to $3.403 billion, driven by broad strong growth in each of Google's hardware, Play, and Cloud subsegments.

On other bets

Speaking to Porat's mention of ""strong progress in Other Bets,"" remember that this segment is primarily comprised of early-stage, pre-revenue businesses operating in several disparate industries. As such, growth and profitability of the other bets segment can vary widely from quarter to quarter so is best viewed through a long-term lens.

In the meantime, other bets achieved respectable 74.7% year-over-year growth in fourth-quarter revenue, to $262 million, almost completely attributable again to sales of Nest connected home products, Fiber high-speed internet, and Verily longevity solutions. Other bets continued to remain solidly un profitable (for now), generating an operating loss of $1.088 billion, which was narrowed from a $1.213 billion operating loss in the same year-ago period. Even excluding stock-based compensation, other bets' operating loss would have been $927 million, compared to $1.082 billion excluding SBC in last year's fourth quarter.

Looking forward

Alphabet didn't offer specific forward financial guidance as per usual. But in a broader sense, management did suggest during the subsequent conference call that they plan to focus on not only continuing the momentum of their core advertising business in 2017 but also investing to further grow additional revenue streams as it works to diversify its business.

As Porat explained:

We remain excited about the sizable opportunities that have not yet been tapped. Alongside these businesses, we are focused on growing additional revenue streams within Google over the medium and long term. In 2016, our ""Other"" revenue line grew 41% on a full-year basis reflecting the growth in our Play, hardware, and cloud businesses. We see tremendous potential ahead for these businesses, as well as in the continued development in non-advertising revenue streams from YouTube. We're investing in our cloud and hardware businesses, as well as our newer non-ad revenue sources from YouTube in order to accelerate their progress as major revenue drivers for Google in the next several years.

In the end, apart from Alphabet's slight bottom-line shortfall relative to Wall Street's expectations, this was another strong performance, with continued admirable top-line growth from the global tech juggernaut. And with shares only enduring a modest pullback right now from all-time highs, I think Alphabet investors should be more than pleased with where their company stands.

It's an awkward topic for rogue, extreme-right wing elements in our country. Heck, I'm not even sure how I really feel about it. But there's a point where it's no longer useful to continuously ignore the giant pink elephant in the room. So here goes it - Asia will take over the world. There's not a darn thing anyone can do to stop the train. And Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) will have it no other way.

Source: Shutterstock

In fact, Facebook is probably one of the few companies that recognize this demographic reality. Subsequently, FB stock is a very real challenger to the near-hegemonic dominance of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ).

Honestly, the social media network is well on its way to becoming what Apple Inc . (NASDAQ: AAPL ) once was before copycat competitors entered the fray: a completely unique experience and solution with no natural predators.

Interestingly, much of society is turning their back towards the demographic goldmine that Facebook stock is sitting on. The NFL celebrates "" Hispanic Heritage Month ,"" and Mexico City hosted a regular-season game last year. After activists blasted the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences with the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite, the film industry made dramatic changes. According to NBC News, the ""'African-American Film Critics Association declared 2016 the best year for blacks in cinema 'ever'.""

While these are profound steps towards diversity and inclusion, there's a glaring omission. According to researchers at the University of Southern California , ""'at least half or more of all cinematic, television, or streaming stories"" didn't portray a single Asian or Asian-American on screen.'""

This ""yellow-out"" may be swept under the rug now, but mark my words, FB stock will change everything.

Asian Markets Too Bigly for FB Stock to Ignore

As InvestorPlace contributor Craig Adeyanju notes, the Facebook stock price is all about the numbers, and the numbers look amazing! Adeyanju writes that with ""Facebook on course to reach 2 billion users this year without China, the opportunities become bigger once China allows FB in its country again. Keep in mind that China currently has the largest number of internet users globally.""

He is so right - the number of China's internet users exceed that of the U.S. by a more than 150% margin. Those are bigly consumers that FB stock desperately wants to tap into. But they're not that desperate. China is often overused as a justification for buying Facebook stock or any number of investments. However, just scale up the picture a bit and you'll see why Mark Zuckerberg is so excited.

The majority of Earth's human population is Asian, period. Even if you were to open a ""heritage month"" for every race, color and creed in America, you would at most affect less than 5% of the world. Adding in the entire Latin American population would help, but the leverage would be less than Africa, and slightly more than Europe.

An investment in Facebook stock is simply a recognition of a changing world. Unfortunately, few have this ability. For example, Princeton University detailed evidence of discrimination in academia designed to ""cull"" Asian student populations. In contrast, from the perspective of FB stock, these demographic trends are to be embraced, celebrated and ultimately, profited.

Untapped Riches Still Available for Facebook Stock

I mentioned before that China is an overused argument. But when you drill deeper into the statistics, there's still a lot of gold for FB stock to mine. The perennial Asian powerhouse's internet penetration is just slightly above half the population. In contrast, the U.S. internet penetration is nearly 89%. That's the raw, low-hanging fruit from which Facebook stock can benefit.

But even in a place like Japan, where the internet penetration is more than 91%, there's still a viable opportunity for FB. As of the midway point of last year, there were 26 million Japanese Facebook subscribers. That's less than a 21% penetration rate for the company. Japan is actually an unheralded market: it has an incredibly educated, tech savvy population.

In many ways, that's a better prospect for FB stock rather than activating developing or frontier markets because of the existing infrastructure.



Click to Enlarge

But the really exciting potential is that when developing countries reach the next stage, FB can spark a global revolution. Asia's total Facebook penetration rate is less than 14% - just marginally better than Africa. That means that the company's future is in Asian hands.

The North American market is near realistic capacity at 62%, while Latin America is not that far behind at 52%. Given the enormous economic growth in Asia, that's not a bad gig for FB stock.

While the rest of the world is focused on the transition of power at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Facebook has been looking at a trend decades in the making. Indeed, the movement is inevitable and will have far-reaching consequences well outside our lifetimes. They only thing any company can do is to prepare for it, and FB has a substantial lead.

I recently shared a story on how to get free profits from Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) stock. My profits came too fast, but luckily, now that the earnings are out, I have another chance to reset .

My interpretation of the GOOGL earnings is that the machine is still on rails. It's a money-making machine with multiple assets that have over a billion users. Management is still somewhat in check when it comes to extraneous spending on wild ventures. So I am left worrying only on Wall Street's perception when trading Alphabet stock.

I am bullish in the long term, so I will sell someone a losing lotto ticket. The trick is to find a level where GOOGL is not likely to go and let time do the rest.



Click to Enlarge The Trade: Sell the GOOGL Jan 2018 $650 put. This is a bullish trade for which I collect $16 per contract to open. This trade has a 90%-plus theoretical chance of success and a 23% price buffer from current levels.

By selling naked puts, I commit to buying the stock at my sold strike if GOOGL stock falls below it. So I only do this if I am willing and able to own the stock there. My breakeven level is $634 per share.

Usually I like to hedge my trade by taking an opposing trade to balance. But in this uber bullish environment, I will leave it un-hedged. Short of a market crash I should have enough time to manage price gyrations.

Selling naked puts is not suited for all portfolios or trader profiles. Risk tolerances vary, so I will offer an alternate trade with similar metrics. This will have finite risk, so a better fit would have more conservative approaches without changing the trade spirit.

The Alternate: Sell the GOOGL Jan 2018 $650/$640 credit put spread. This is also a bullish trade for which I collect $2.50 per contract to open. This also comes with a 90% theoretical chance of success. The yield on money risked would be 33%. All I need is GOOGL to stay above my sold spread to win.

I am not required to hold these options trades through expiration. I can close any of them for partial gains or losses.

(RTTNews.com) - Following the lackluster performance seen in the previous session, stocks continued to show a lack of direction during trading on Friday. The major averages spent much of the day lingering near the unchanged line.

The major averages eventually closed mixed. While the Nasdaq inched up 5.61 points or 0.1 percent to a new record closing high of 5,660.68, the Dow edged down 7.13 points or less than a tenth of a percent to 20,093.78 and the S&P 500 dipped 1.99 points or 0.1 percent to 2,294.69.

Despite the roughly sideways movement over the past two days, the major averages moved notably higher for the week. The Nasdaq surged up by 1.9 percent, the Dow jumped by 1.3 percent and the S&P 500 advanced by 1 percent.

Traders were also digesting the mixed batch of earnings news released by several big-name technology companies after the close of trading on Thursday.

While Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) reported weaker than expected fourth quarter earnings, Intel (INTC) and Microsoft (MSFT) both reported better than expected quarterly results.

In economic news, the Commerce Department released a report showing economic growth in the U.S. slowed by more than anticipated in the final three months of 2016.

The report said gross domestic product increased by 1.9 percent in the fourth quarter following a 3.5 percent jump in the third quarter. Economists had expected GDP to climb by 2.2 percent.

Economists noted that the slowdown was largely due to the impact of fluctuations in trade and said the third and fourth quarters together indicate a strong second half.

A separate report from the Commerce Department showed durable goods orders unexpectedly declined in December amid a continued decrease in orders for transportation equipment.

The Commerce Department said durable goods orders fell by 0.4 percent in December after tumbling by a revised 4.8 percent in November. Economists had expected durable goods orders to jump by 2.6 percent.

However, excluding the drop in orders for transportation equipment, durable goods orders rose by 0.5 percent in December after jumping by 1.0 percent in November. The increase matched estimates.

The University of Michigan also released a report showing that consumer sentiment unexpectedly improved to its highest level in thirteen years in January.

Sector News

After moving notably higher over the past few sessions, airline stocks gave back ground on the day. Reflecting the weakness in the sector, the NYSE Arca Airline Index tumbled by 2.1 percent.

American Airlines ( AAL ) posted a notable loss after reporting fourth quarter earnings that fell year-over-year but matched analyst estimates. The airline also announced a new $2.0 billion share repurchase authorization.

Considerable weakness was also visible among energy stocks, which came as pressure as the price of crude oil for March delivery fell $0.61 to $53.17 a barrel.

On the other hand, software and semiconductor stocks saw significant strength on the heels of the upbeat earnings news from Microsoft and Intel.

Biotechnology stocks also showed a strong move to the upside, resulting in a 1.3 percent advance by the NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index.

Other Markets

In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly higher during trading on Friday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index rose by 0.3 percent, while Australia's All Ordinaries Index advanced by 0.7 percent. The Chinese markets were closed on the day.

Meanwhile, the major European markets turned in a mixed performance on the day. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index increased by 0.3 percent, the German DAX Index dipped by 0.3 percent and the French CAC 40 Index slid by 0.6 percent.

In the bond market, treasuries saw further upside after turning higher over the course of the previous session. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, fell by 2.7 basis points to 2.481 percent.

Looking Ahead

The Federal Reserve is likely to be back in the spotlight next week, with the central bank due to announce its latest monetary policy decision on Wednesday.

With the official Galaxy Note 7 battery review out of the way, everyone has been waiting for Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (OTCMKTS: SSNLF ) to release the new Galaxy S8. Samsung still isn't saying anything, but clues have been building that it will be later than normal. Now VentureBeat says it has the first photos of the elusive smartphone as well as an exact Galaxy S8 launch date.

Samsung's well-publicized disaster with the Galaxy Note 7 had a big ripple effect on the Galaxy S8.

First, the company had to identify - without question - what had caused Galaxy Note 7 batteries to burst into flames. Then it had to pinpoint a fail-safe solution to the problem. After that, it had to hold an event where it publicly reviewed its findings and outlined the steps it had taken to ensure it never happens again. That event took place last week .

Galaxy S8 Launch Pushed Back by Battery Concerns

As part of the battery investigation, Samsung also had to take measures to ensure the Galaxy S8 would not have similar problems, and that would have involved delayed finalization of the battery and related components. And you can bet the company has taken testing of the battery on its new flagship smartphone to new levels.

As a result, it seemed likely the Galaxy S8 launch date would be pushed from it's traditional Mobile World Congress unveiling in February. Samsung confirmed this during last week's event.

The Guardian , citing anonymous sources close to Samsung, pointed to a late March release date . Yesterday, VentureBeat's Evan Blass claimed to have specifics , saying the Galaxy S8 launch will take place at a Samsung Unpacked event in New York City on March 29.

Galaxy S8 Details

The VentureBeat report also includes many technical details about SSNLF's new flagship handset(s), including photos.

As has been speculated, it appears that this year both Galaxy S8 smartphones will feature a curved ""Edge"" Super AMOLED display, but both will also lose the Home button so nearly the entire front is display - the camera remains at top. As a result, even though the overall dimensions stay roughly the same, both new smartphones will have larger displays than the Galaxy Note 7: 5.8-inches and 6.2-inches.

The fingerprint sensor has been moved to the back, and high tech biometrics are supplemented by an iris scanner. The charge port is the new USB-C standard, base storage moves to 64GB (with SD card expansion still offered) and unlike Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Samsung will reportedly keep the headphone jack.

By connecting to an optional dock, the Galaxy S8 will be able to be used as an Android computer. And it will feature Bixby, the advanced AI personal assistant Samsung gained when it purchased Viv in October.

Interestingly, VentureBeat says the price of both models - which it says will go on sale April 21 - will be €100 (roughly $100) more than last year's models.

The Importance of the Galaxy S8 Launch

It can't be understated how critical this release is to SSNLF. After recalling 3 million Galaxy Note 7s', its reputation took a serious blow. Apple will be pulling out all the stops with the iPhone 8 later this year, as it celebrates the iPhone's 10th anniversary and mounts a major campaign to convince upgraders. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) released its first Google-branded smartphone in the Pixel Phone at the height of the Galaxy Note 7 debacle, and a follow-up is expected this year.

Both rivals will be gunning to boost sales at Samsung's expense.

In the last quarterly sales report (from the end of October), Samsung's smartphone sales marketshare had dropped 13.5% compared to the previous year. The next quarter's numbers could be even worse. If the Galaxy S8 launch flops, Samsung's time at the top of the smartphone sales charts would likely be over.

As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) is introducing a new way for users to protect their accounts with Security Keys.

Facebook Security Keys are actual physical devices that a person can carry on them to give them access to their FB account. It works with Universal 2nd Factor and acts as a second level of security after the user's password is entered.

Facebook Security Keys are plugged into USB ports for use. Once plugged in, an owner simply has to tap the button on the device to have it provide the information needed to log in to their account.

Facebook already recommends YubiKey as a retailer that users can obtain the Security Keys from. The devices start at $18 and go up to $50 . They can also work on other supported accounts, such as Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOG , GOOGL ) Google and salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE: CRM ).

The advantages of using a Facebook Security Key include protection from phishing. It makes it almost impossible for hackers to obtain access to a user's account without the psychical key.

As it is now, Facebook Security Keys will only work on the newest versions of Chrome and Opera on computers. They also don't work with the company's smartphone app. However, owners of Android devices can use them to log in from the newest mobile version of Chrome. This requires the device to support NFC and for it to have Google Authenticator installed.

Facebook Security Keys were introduced at the same time that the social media company updated its Privacy Basics. The update introduces several new options for users and makes Privacy Basics easier to navigate on mobile devices.

May I be frank with you? General Electric Company (NYSE: GE ) is a bit of a bore, and that's putting it mildly. In fact, of the thousands of investments available, GE stock is the one I dread analyzing. Amazon.com, Inc . (NASDAQ: AMZN ) has the sexy industry, Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ) has the sexy CEO - or so I've been told - and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) basically owns sex . General Electric? It has a 3.23% dividend yield - I think you're getting my drift.

Source: Shutterstock

That's not to say that GE stock is irrelevant in the current markets. This week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit 20,000 points for the first time in history.

Not only is General Electric a component of the Dow 30, it was a strong contributor to the record. GE stock turned in a 1.23% performance against its prior session. The average gains for the Dow-listed companies on the record-breaking day was only 0.6%, which is surprisingly low.

In fact, there were only six companies that posted better numbers than GE, and these were the usual suspects. In increasing order, they were International Business Machines Corp . (NYSE: IBM ), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS ), JPMorgan Chase & Co . (NYSE: JPM ), Apple Inc . (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and standout Boeing Co (NYSE: BA ), which ringed up an impressive 4% move.

Besides the obvious point that these companies are proudly red, white and blue, it's easy to see why they performed so well over the others. President Donald Trump has promised fewer regulations stymieing business, more support for the military industrial complex and keeping jobs stateside. General Electric belongs among the titans of American industry; hence, yesterday's robust gains.

But is the recent surge of GE stock based on optimism for President Trump, or a reaction from pronounced volatility? The answer to that question is critical for investors.

GE Stock Is Exciting, and That's Bad!

GE has shed its boring image, but for all the wrong reasons.



Click to Enlarge

While it's very early into the new year, nevertheless, it's worth pointing out that shares are down 4%. I should also mention that at this price point, GE stock is firmly below its 50-day moving average, and only a hair above its 200-DMA.

I don't think the volatility should be ignored as a bunch of technical mumbo jumbo. Just a few days ago, General Electric shares were down 6%.

More worryingly, traders haven't pushed the needle that far since GE faltered under the weight of an uninspiring and anemic fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 earnings results.

Rightfully, people are concerned. True, GE stock is a reliable investment, making steady gains through all sorts of economic cycles. At the same time, its stable nature can work against the investor if there's a sharp downfall. It may take an inordinate amount of time for General Electric to gain 10%, but it could be gone in a flash. As an example, GE returned 6% last year - and we've basically burned through two-thirds of that profit.

I don't care how high the dividend yields are for General Electric. No one can afford to lose that much capital and justify the losses due to the passive income. Unless GE stock was offering double digits, it's a bad deal. Of course, the question would then become, why are they offering double digits?

Just Stay the Course With General Electric

So should potential buyers heed the warning? Absolutely, they should! GE stock has formed an ""inside day"" pattern against the losses incurred by the feeble earnings report. Unless shares can quickly fill the technical gap, momentum definitely leans bearishly. Attempting to catch a falling knife here would not be the greatest idea.

That said, the month of January is GE stock's kryptonite . The last three Januarys produced a shockingly bad loss of 6%. Since 1962, General Electric has averaged only 0.8% returns for the opening month of the calendar. In nominal terms, there were only 28 positive Januarys over that time frame. That means that GE stock is as useful as a coin toss during the NFL playoffs.

However, the industrial titan is a consistent winner over the long run. By the end of the year, GE stock is good for an average 13% return. Nominally, 39 years ended sunny side up. This current decade has been particularly robust, averaging over 15%.

I've made this argument before, but it really comes down to your end goal. If you're looking for a hot growth stock, look elsewhere, please! If you want to bide your time and not rock your portfolio with risk, GE stock is a prudent choice.

But even reliable names have their off seasons. Watch General Electric closely, and wait for a baseline of technical support before going in too rich.

While revenue jumped 22% to $26.1 billion and surpassed analysts' consensus estimate (via Thomson Reuters) for revenue of $25.2 billion, the company's earnings of $9.36 per share fell short of a projection for $9.64.

As investors digest the information from Alphabet's latest report, here's a look at some of the most insightful comments from the company's fourth-quarter earnings call. In these quotes, management discusses the success of the new Google-branded hardware, further opportunity in advertising, and what it considers the three biggest bets for the company beyond its core ad business.

Alphabet's core search business hasn't peaked -- far from it

After pointing to the company's impressive 20% consolidated revenue growth in 2016, which management emphasized is actually 24% when excluding the impact of currency headwinds, Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat emphasized (via a Reuters transcript ) the opportunity ahead:

This performance is a testament to the ongoing innovation that is driving our success in mobile search, YouTube, and programmatic advertising, each of which we believe has only begun to scratch the surface. We remain excited about the sizable opportunities that have not yet been tapped.

These could become major revenue drivers

With about 86% of Alphabet's total revenue coming from advertising, it's always nice to get an update on whether the company is seeing success on diversifying its revenue sources. To this end, Alphabet made excellent progress in its fourth quarter. Here's what Porat had to say:

Alongside these [advertising] businesses, we are focused on growing additional revenue streams within Google over the medium- and long-term. In 2016, our other revenue line grew 41% on a full year basis reflecting the growth in our Play, hardware and cloud businesses. We see tremendous potential ahead for these businesses, as well as in the continued development of non-advertising revenue streams for YouTube. We're investing in our cloud and hardware businesses, as well as our newer non-ad revenue sources for YouTube, in order to accelerate their progress as major revenue drivers for Google in the next several years.

Alphabet's other revenue growth in the Google segment (not to be confused with Alphabet's ""other bets"") was even more impressive in the company's fourth quarter specifically. Fourth-quarter other revenue soared 62% year over year, to $3.4 billion, accounting for 13% of total revenue, up from 10% of revenue in the year-ago quarter. Management cited hardware, the Google Play app store, and its cloud business as key drivers for the segment.

Google-branded hardware looks promising

Drilling down more narrowly on the company's nascent hardware business, which received some extra attention from the company in the fourth quarter when Google launched its voice-activated smart speaker (Google Home) and a new smartphone (Google Pixel), management was optimistic about how new hardware is performing in the marketplace. Google CEO Sundar Pichai explained:

We introduced a new family of beautiful hardware devices in October that are made by Google, led by Google Home and our Pixel phone which feature the Google Assistant built in. We're thrilled with the reception, as well as the really happy customers we saw over the holiday season. In particular, Google Home was a very popular present that many people opened on Christmas morning. We have committed to this for the long-term, as a great way to bring a beautiful seamless Google experience to people. The early signs are promising, and you can expect us to see us expand our offerings thoughtfully.

Alphabet's three big bets

Pichai said that beyond its core advertising business, the company distinctly views ""YouTube, cloud and hardware"" as ""three of our biggest bets."" So investors should keep an eye on these areas as Alphabet continues to grow its business.

Management's extreme confidence in incremental opportunity in Alphabet's core search business, along with significant and promising growth in YouTube, cloud, and hardware, continues to make a great case for owning this stock. Not only is the company strengthening the competitive position of its core business, but it's also diversifying its revenue while simultaneously opening the doors to meaningful opportunities beyond advertising.

Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) reported fourth-quarter earnings last night, missing earnings expectations despite a beat up top. Beyond the core ad business, there were a few interesting developments worth highlighting. Expectedly, ""Other Bets"" continues to bleed out, generating an operating loss of nearly $1.1 billion on revenue of $262 million. The company lost $3.6 billion on these side bets throughout the full year. Hardware revenue is growing amid the company's broader push into products like the Pixel phone and new mesh Wi-Fi router system, among others.

Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author.

But by far the most puzzling aspect of the release was a one-time charge of $320 million that Alphabet mentioned in passing but would not elaborate much on. No one knows what the charge is for, and that's a decent chunk of change.

The $320 million question

CFO Ruth Porat attributed most of the charge to ""equipment,"" and it came out of cost of revenue: ""However, it's important to note the cost of revenues was also affected by approximately $320 million of one-time charges related to equipment and other adjustments which were unrelated to hardware.""

Analysts tried to pry more detail out of Porat, with little success. When asked by two separate analysts, one of whom noted that it's ""a relatively sizable amount,"" she mostly reiterated her previous remark:

And in terms of, you noted the one-time item, there were really two, that I'm actually going to call out. One was in the cost of revenues. I noted that equipment costs were elevated by some one-time charges, and so there was some pressure there. And then, the other item I noted was, with respect to our tax rate. ... So on the first one, trying to be helpful in giving you dimension and impact on cost of sales, but really not much more to add there. I think the other point is, is you're thinking about the hardware business, it was gross margin positive. There was just some other variables in there.

The charge is a one-time item, which investors are often willing to brush aside, but it's still confounding. It's also worth noting that if it weren't for this charge, Google likely would have beat the bottom-line consensus estimate, so it's not insignificant. Probably the most compelling theory comes from J.P. Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth (via Tech Trader Daily ), who believes it's related to Google Fiber.

If you recall, Google said in late October that it would ""pause"" its expansion plans, although it would continue strengthening its Fiber technology in its existing markets. That also entailed laying off Fiber employees, and Google Access CEO Craig Barratt would be stepping down (but remain onboard as an advisor). Google Access is the subsidiary that includes the company's ambitions to improve internet access, which includes Fiber and is accounted for in Other Bets.

This could help explain the $223 million sequential increase in Other Bets' operating loss. The incredibly high costs associated with expansion have always been a major hurdle to growing Fiber's footprint , and the change of strategic direction for Fiber could have resulted in writing down a bunch of equipment that had already been purchased.

For the quarter, the company reported 22% year-on-year growth in revenues to $26.04 billion, in line with our expectation. On a constant-currency basis, revenues grew 24%. In line with our assessment in the pre-earnings note, much of the growth was driven by mobile search and YouTube.

Google segment revenues for the quarter were $25.80 billion and were up 22% over the prior year. While Google's operating profit grew by 16.9%, the operating margin declined by 130 basis point to 30.6%. In contrast, Alphabet's moon-shot 'other bets' generated revenues of $262 million and operating losses of $1.08 billion.

The core search business continued to witness pricing pressure, while ad volume for the company continued to grow. Furthermore, the movement in Google Sites paid clicks and CPCs primarily reflects the continued growth in YouTube, TrueView and mobile search. Furthermore, the company said that the momentum in its play store sales and programmatic platform were instrumental in revenue growth in Q4. In this note, we will discuss Google's results.

Number of Clicks Grows Due To Programmatic Buying Even As Cost-Per-Click Continues To Decline

We currently estimate that PC search ads, mobile search ads and YouTube ads contribute over 60% to the firm's value. Cost per click (CPC), a metric that measures the price paid for the number of times a visitor clicks on a search ad, has been in a steady decline for the past few years. This quarter, it declined by 16% on Google websites and 11% on network member sites. Furthermore, aggregate cost per click declined by 15% during the quarter. The recent trend is indicative of geographical mix, device mix, currency headwinds and property mix.

Additionally, Google is looking to monetize its properties through its programmatic platform, which matches relevant ads with content. However, this is negatively impacting Google's CPC as the programmatic platform does away with inefficiencies of improper ad matching. As a result, the company's top line growth from search ads across network member and owned sites has failed to match the growth in search volume. Google is focusing on its programmatic businesses including AdMob, AdExchange, DoubleClick Bid Manager, and these continue to grow at a strong rate. This has resulted in an increase in ad volumes and 36% improvement in aggregate paid clicks for Google. Furthermore, video ads also witnessed a decline in RPM due to the rapid growth of YouTube, where a majority choose to use TrueView ads and the contribution from buying on DoubleClick Bid Manager, which monetizes at lower rates than ad clicks on Google.com. Going forward, as Google improves its programmatic platform, we expect that the growth in online advertising paid clicks will continue but still weigh on CPC.

Play Store And Hardware Revenues Grew

The Google Phone division makes up approximately 6.8% of its estimated total value, according to our model. Google, with 90% market share, dominates the mobile search engine market. One of the key reasons for this dominance is its flagship Android OS, which has witnessed excellent adoption and penetration in the smartphone space. The company reported that Google play witnessed double-digit growth across the world and growth was over 70% in countries like India, Turkey and Mexico.

As part of its strategy, it remains focused on building the mobile ecosystem that has the right ad formats and measurement to take advantage of all the platform ads. Google has launched artificial intelligence based Assistant app that helps users with advanced search. Its mobile services like Now on Tap, which essentially uses machine learning, lets user access additional useful information based on recent search and present location. We believe that, as Google's mobile strategy for content and ads continues to evolve, the ads and content revenues will increase in coming years. This will also lead to growth in sales of Google phone and Home hardware.

Performance Of Other Bets

Its Other bets business, which includes Fiber, Verily, Calico, Nest, self-driving cars, and incubation activities in X, reported revenue of $262 million and operating losses of $1.08 billion on a quarterly basis. Other Bets capital expenditures were $504 million for the quarter, primarily reflecting investment in the Fiber business. Nevertheless, the company did report key business wins across Verily, Calico, Nest and Waymo.

We are in the process of updating our model. We currently have a $821 price estimate for Google , which is in line with the current market price.

U.S. equities drifted lower on Friday as investors looked back on the first week of the Trump Administration (High Energy!) and looked toward the week ahead, featuring a Federal Reserve policy decision, the January jobs report and a continuation of the fourth-quarter earnings reporting season.

In the end, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost a fraction, the S&P 500 lost 0.1%, the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.1% and the Russell 2000 lost 0.4%. Treasury bonds were stronger, the dollar was stronger, gold lost 0.1%. and crude oil reversed some of its recent strength by falling 1.1%. The drop in oil boosted the ProShares UltraShort Crude Oil (NYSEARCA: SCO ) recommended to Edge subscribers to a 2.4% gain.

Healthcare stocks led the way with a 0.8% gain while energy was the laggard, down 0.9%. A number of retailers were hit as well, with Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT ) losing its 200-week moving average for the first time since 2011, as Trump seemed to warm to the idea of a border tax that would increase the cost of goods sold.

Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC ) gained 1.1% after reporting a fourth-quarter earnings per share beat 4% ahead of estimates thanks to results from its cloud computing group. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) gained 2.4% after reporting a top-and-bottom line beat as analysts remain excited about the company's cloud business. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) fell 1.4% after missing on earnings.

On the downside, JetBlue Airways Corporation (NASDAQ: JBLU ) fell 6.9% after suffering a downgrade from analysts at Argus citing valuation concerns after a rally over the last three months. Rising fuel costs and other expenses were noted as a concern.

Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE: CL ) fell 5.2% after reporting a 4% revenue miss on slower-than-expected organic sales growth. And Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ) fell 4% after reporting a revenue miss with traffic down 2% in the United States.

On the economic front, GDP growth slowed to a 1.9% rate in the fourth quarter, down from the 3.5% rate seen in Q3 and the 2.2% growth that was expected by analysts. Personal consumption increased at a 2.5% rate, down from 3% in the previous quarter.

Looking ahead, investors have a lot to think about next week including a Federal Reserve policy announcement on Feb. 1. Fed Board Chair Janet Yellen and her cohorts have been sounding a hawkish note lately, leaning against the fiscal stimulus plans of the Trump White House as consumer price inflation rose above their 2% target last month (on fuel and housing costs).

As a reminder, the Fed has penciled in three quarter-point hikes for 2017 vs. just two quarter-point hikes since the tightening campaign started in December 2015.

After that, we've got the non-farm payroll report on Friday, Feb. 3. The unemployment rate has compressed in recent months, standing at 4.7% in January, as the job market tightens. Non-farm payrolls came in at 156,000 in January, continuing a steady if somewhat tepid pace.

Technically, investors should remain cautious as stocks continue to look dramatically overbought here and vulnerable to a profitmaking move to the downside. Sentiment is off the charts here, with the CBOE Volatility Index (INDEXCBOE: VIX ) posting its second-lowest close in 11 years. Breadth continues to narrow.

The company’s top line, which grew 22.18 percent to $26.06 billion, however topped the analysts’ expectations of $25.23 billion. The earnings miss could mean that the company is facing pricing pressure on advertisements placed on its platform.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT): The company announced adjusted earnings of 83 cents a share for the December quarter, which topped analysts’ estimate by four cents. Its revenue of $24.09 billion came in below the analysts’ expectations of $25.28 billion.

Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC): The chip maker reported adjusted profit per share of 79 cents for the fourth quarter on revenue of $16.37 billion, which witnessed 9.79 percent growth. Both topped the Street analysts’ estimates of 75 cents a share on revenue of $15.75 billion.

Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX): The company revealed operating earnings of 52 cents a share for the December quarter, which is in line with the Street estimates. Its top line, which advanced 6.69 percent to $5.73 billion, fell short of analysts’ predictions of $5.85 billion. The company reiterated its full year adjusted EPS of $2.12 – $2.14 while Street analysts are looking for an EPS of $2.14.

Juniper Networks, Inc. (NYSE:JNPR) reported earnings of 66 cents a share on total revenue of $1.39 billion for the fourth quarter. Street analysts estimate the company to report 63 cents a share on revenue of $1.36 billion. Its guidance for the second quarter fell short of estimates. The company guided EPS 38 – 44 cents a share for the first quarter while analysts expected 45 cents.

Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN): The company reported earnings of 50 cents a share for the fourth quarter. This is short of analysts’ expectations of 86 cents a share. However, revenue, which was $1.30 billion, came in above the expected level of $1.26 billion.

American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ:AAL) to reveal its financial results before the bell. Market sees an EPS of $0.91.

(NASDAQ: MSFT) was left for dead five years ago, it was unimaginable that it could be ranked among America’s most successful companies as it had been for the two decades of Windows’ dominance. Now, with its success in cloud computing and the engines of several of its older businesses, Microsoft threatens to pass Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL), the owner of Google, in market cap, as the search company struggles to find new large and fast-growing businesses.

Microsoft has come close to doing what was once impossible: becoming the second most valuable public company in America, trailing only Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL). After earnings, Alphabet’s stock sold down so that its market cap is about $565 billion. Microsoft’s rose to $515 billion.

Microsoft’s earnings, matched against Alphabet’s, show the extent to which CEO Satya Nadella has transformed the company. Microsoft’s Productivity and Businesses division had revenue of $7.3 billion. The division has both the consumer and business sides of the old Windows business. The Intelligent Cloud division is Microsoft’s huge cloud intuitive, which is large enough to threaten industry leader Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN). Its revenue was $6.9 billion. More Personal Computing, the third division, had revenue of $11.8 billion. It has the legacy game segment, search and Microsoft OEM.

Google, on the other hand, continues to rely almost completely on search, which makes it the one-legged stool that creates investor anxiety. Google ad revenue was $19.1 billion of the fourth quarter total of $21.2 billion. And the aggregate cost per click, one of Google’s most important metrics, fell 9% year over year. Its revenue from what it calls “other bets” was a mere $262 million.

As investors look for stability with large tech companies, which currently trade at historically high levels, they can only find it in public corporations that successfully operate multiple businesses. Microsoft’s shares have risen 23% in the past year, about the same as the Nasdaq, and Alphabet’s by 14%. This does not take into account stock movements after earnings announcements. At the rate of growth in stock prices, Microsoft will be the more valuable of the two companies by mid-year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Microsoft topped projections on the strength of rising customer sign-ups for its cloud offerings like Azure, which saw revenue almost double. Intel sales rose more than expected, helped by orders for processors that power data-center servers -- the machines at the heart of cloud computing.

While profit at Google parent Alphabet disappointed, the numbers also signaled that heavy spending to catch cloud leaders Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft is paying off. Google’s Other Revenue line, which includes cloud computing, jumped 62 percent to $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter.

""Our cloud business is on a terrific upswing,"" Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said Thursday during a conference call with analysts. ""I definitely think we’re going to have a great year.""

What started a decade ago as an easy way for startups to run websites has turned into an increasingly popular way for companies of all sizes to access the software needed to run their operations. Many big technology companies are in a strong position to provide this because they already have huge data centers to support their own web services.

‘Disruptive Forces’

More than $1 trillion in IT spending will be directly or indirectly affected by the shift to cloud during the next five years, Gartner estimated in July. ""This will make cloud computing one of the most disruptive forces of IT spending since the early days of the digital age,"" the research firm said at the time.

Stock prices reflect this optimism. Microsoft and Alphabet shares hit a record this week. Microsoft gained 2.2 percent, Google was down about 1 percent and Intel rose 1.5 percent at 1:57 p.m. Friday in New York.

Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella has been working to reposition the company around such internet services. In addition to robust demand for Azure, consumers and corporations continue to purchase Office 365, a cloud-based version of the company’s productivity software that includes Word and Excel. Almost 25 million consumers are now subscribed to Office 365, Microsoft said, and sales increased 47 percent in the fiscal second quarter.

""As long as cloud is growing, people are happy,” said Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., who rates Microsoft shares outperform. “If margins are growing, people are even happier.""

Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft has been spending on data centers and adding products to win new cloud customers. Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said in July that gross margins, a measure of profitability, for the commercial cloud business would ""materially improve"" in the current year. That’s because previous years of investment are starting to pay off as those data centers support more customers.

Microsoft has pledged to reach annualized revenue of $20 billion in its corporate cloud business by the fiscal year that ends in June 2018. That metric stood at more than $14 billion at the end of the second quarter.

Intel’s fourth-quarter sales of server chips to cloud service providers jumped 30 percent from a year earlier. Offsetting that, companies and government agencies spent 7 percent less than they had in the same quarter in 2016 on equipping their in-house computer rooms, the company said.

“It’s moving to the public cloud, it’s moving to those areas at a faster rate than I think we expected,” Intel Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich said on a conference call.

Amazon reports earnings next week and analysts at RBC Capital Markets expect the company’s AWS cloud business to generate $3.6 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, up 50 percent from a year earlier.

It seems they’re trying to do damage control after widespread headlines that the company had missed estimates for the bottom line. A change in the company’s accounting procedures apparently is causing some confusion.

Alphabet stock to $1,000: Morgan Stanley

Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak raised his target for Alphabet stock to a nice round $1,000 per share. The Google parent company reported adjusted earnings of $9.36 per share, compared to the consensus of $9.64 per share. However, after making further adjustments, Nowak says that the company would have reported $10.05 per share, excluding equipment charges, a one-time tax headwind, and other one-time charges.

He notes that the amounts of some of these one-time charges are unclear and that it’s not uncommon for Alphabet to income such charges below the line. However, he said based on fundamentals, the result was still better than expected.

Another key bullish point was that Websites revenue increased 23%, which was more than expected, and adjusted EBIT beat Nowak’s estimate by 9%, excluding some of the other charges he added in. He also spoke to the suggestion that the company’s core margin pressure was worsening, but he doesn’t think this is necessarily the case, even with the introduction of the Pixel phones. Again, this goes back to the one-time charges he includes that Alphabet didn’t.

Deutsche Bank analysts peg Alphabet’s adjusted earnings higher than Nowak, at $10.30 per share after making their own adjustments and factoring in the 4.2% higher tax rate.

Alphabet stock target to $1,050: Stifel

Deutsche Bank analysts peg Alphabet’s adjusted earnings higher than Nowak, at $10.30 per share after making their own adjustments and factoring in the 4.2% higher tax rate.

Stifel analyst Scott Devitt boosted his price target for Alphabet stock from $950 to $1,050 per share after last night’s print. He continued the Wall Street narrative that the company actually beat consensus for non-GAAP earnings based on one-time adjustments. He merely described it as “comfortably above the Street if Alphabet has excluded the previously mentioned $320mm in one-time costs.”

Among the other analysts who boosted their price targets for Alphabet stock is Macquarie’s Ben Schachter, who moved his target from $975 to $995 and pronounced the fourth quarter report “mostly fine, more of the same.” Also Baird analyst Colin Sebastian raised his target for Alphabet stock from $930 to $960. He’s also of the view that the company’s non-GAAP earnings were better than what the headlines suggest and noted “surprisingly strong” revenues from the “Other” segment, which points to momentum in the Cloud, contributions from Play, and early success from the Pixel line, Home hardware products and other inclusions.

Alphabet’s earnings a negative sign for Facebook?

Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts also agree with the view that Alphabet’s adjusted earnings should be considered a beat despite the headlines. They note that the company didn’t state what the $320 charge was for and that it said it will no longer exclude stock-based compensation from its non-GAAP earnings, which is a key change.

On a side note, they’re concerned that Alphabet’s earnings could be a bearish signal for Facebook which suggests that expectations could be too high. The reason is because Google Websites revenue didn’t match their “more bullish channel checks.”

While revenue jumped 22% to $26.1 billion and surpassed analysts' consensus estimate (via Thomson Reuters) for revenue of $25.2 billion, the company's earnings of $9.36 per share fell short of a projection for $9.64.

As investors digest the information from Alphabet's latest report, here's a look at some of the most insightful comments from the company's fourth-quarter earnings call. In these quotes, management discusses the success of the new Google-branded hardware, further opportunity in advertising, and what it considers the three biggest bets for the company beyond its core ad business.

Alphabet's core search business hasn't peaked -- far from it

After pointing to the company's impressive 20% consolidated revenue growth in 2016, which management emphasized is actually 24% when excluding the impact of currency headwinds, Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat emphasized (via a Reuters transcript) the opportunity ahead:

This performance is a testament to the ongoing innovation that is driving our success in mobile search, YouTube, and programmatic advertising, each of which we believe has only begun to scratch the surface. We remain excited about the sizable opportunities that have not yet been tapped.

These could become major revenue drivers

With about 86% of Alphabet's total revenue coming from advertising, it's always nice to get an update on whether the company is seeing success on diversifying its revenue sources. To this end, Alphabet made excellent progress in its fourth quarter. Here's what Porat had to say:

Alongside these [advertising] businesses, we are focused on growing additional revenue streams within Google over the medium- and long-term. In 2016, our other revenue line grew 41% on a full year basis reflecting the growth in our Play, hardware and cloud businesses. We see tremendous potential ahead for these businesses, as well as in the continued development of non-advertising revenue streams for YouTube. We're investing in our cloud and hardware businesses, as well as our newer non-ad revenue sources for YouTube, in order to accelerate their progress as major revenue drivers for Google in the next several years.

Alphabet's other revenue growth in the Google segment (not to be confused with Alphabet's ""other bets"") was even more impressive in the company's fourth quarter specifically. Fourth-quarter other revenue soared 62% year over year, to $3.4 billion, accounting for 13% of total revenue, up from 10% of revenue in the year-ago quarter. Management cited hardware, the Google Play app store, and its cloud business as key drivers for the segment.

Google-branded hardware looks promising

Drilling down more narrowly on the company's nascent hardware business, which received some extra attention from the company in the fourth quarter when Google launched its voice-activated smart speaker (Google Home) and a new smartphone (Google Pixel), management was optimistic about how new hardware is performing in the marketplace. Google CEO Sundar Pichai explained:

We introduced a new family of beautiful hardware devices in October that are made by Google, led by Google Home and our Pixel phone which feature the Google Assistant built in. We're thrilled with the reception, as well as the really happy customers we saw over the holiday season. In particular, Google Home was a very popular present that many people opened on Christmas morning. We have committed to this for the long-term, as a great way to bring a beautiful seamless Google experience to people. The early signs are promising, and you can expect us to see us expand our offerings thoughtfully.

Alphabet's three big bets

Pichai said that beyond its core advertising business, the company distinctly views ""YouTube, cloud and hardware"" as ""three of our biggest bets."" So investors should keep an eye on these areas as Alphabet continues to grow its business.

Management's extreme confidence in incremental opportunity in Alphabet's core search business, along with significant and promising growth in YouTube, cloud, and hardware, continues to make a great case for owning this stock. Not only is the company strengthening the competitive position of its core business, but it's also diversifying its revenue while simultaneously opening the doors to meaningful opportunities beyond advertising.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wall Street consensus is for earnings of $9.64 per share on revenues of $25.2 billion for the December quarter. Current expectations are that the company will have earned $34.48 per share on revenues of $89.4 billion for all of 2016.

For the current quarter ending in March, the sellsiders are expecting earnings of $9.34 per share on revenues of $23.7 billion.

Three key areas that will be watched by investors and by Street analysts include artificial intelligence (AI) (which includes the company's efforts in autonomous automobile technology), YouTube and hardware, including Pixel smartphones. Of course, the company's search business is always intensely scrutinized, especially CPC (cost per click).

This is the first quarter since Google released the Pixel smartphone, and data on sales are all over the place at the moment. Hopefully, management sheds some insight there, so as to eliminate the wide spectrum in unit sales and market share that have been reported thus far. In addition, investors will also be looking for comments on whether the company plans to expand its carrier agreements beyond Verizon going forward.

YouTube will be another area that will be closely scrutinized, as it is widely thought to be an area that is currently under-monetized. Look for color from management regarding its video programming distribution plans in order to offset slowing momentum and monetization in core search as growth in CPCs continue to slow.

Growth of paid clicks on ads placed on Google sites is expected to decline to 26% in the December quarter compared to 33% in the prior quarter sequentially and 31% in the year ago quarter.

Looking toward the future, cloud, AI, including other bets, and YouTube are going to be critical drivers of growth for Google, and the sellside focus will also remain there in the Q&A on the conference call after the earnings release.

Google shares are currently indicated to move $34 per share in either direction after earnings tonight. That implied volatility (IV) is currently fairly low, given the fact that during the last several reports, shares of Google have moved between $42 and $99 per share post earnings. Short interest in Google is 2.29 million shares as of December 30, 2016, or about two days worth of average trading volume.

Google shares have lagged the indices since election night (Trump fears in techland) and also relatively under-performed in the last year, as well. Shares of Google are up 5.6% since election night and up 15% in the past year compared to the Nasdaq which is up 9% since election night and up 27% in the last year.

Having said that and having experienced the relative under-performance first hand, I like the risk/reward going into Alphabet's earnings reports tonight and am positioned accordingly.

I mentioned yesterday that we previously heard Google Pixel would bring ‘waterproofing,’ a feature we’re now told is “still on the table.”

We’re also now being told, however, that Google is once again focusing intensely on the camera with Pixel 2, that the device is currently being tested with improved chipsets from two different manufacturers, and that it will bring a higher price. Finally, the same source says Google has lately been testing lower-end Pixel devices which would bring lesser specs and a much lower price tag.

As for waterproofing, this is a slight change in tone today from this same source that before told us the feature would “definitely” be coming with the next Pixel. Now we’re told that the feature is “still on the table,” which would suggest a less firm position from Google on the feature. That said, of all features, waterproofing (or, more accurately, a decent water and dust resistance rating) seems like a no-brainer for the next Pixel. I wouldn’t be surprised if that “still on the table” once again becomes a “definitely” soon.

More interestingly, we’re now told that — just like with last year’s model — the Pixel 2’s camera will be a major focus for the Mountain View company. Our source says that, specifically, Google is aiming to master low light photography with the next-generation device. (Google highlighted the first Pixel’s low-light capabilities in an ad last November.) We’re further told that the phone’s camera will “not have large MP size,” but will rather “compensate in extra features.”

Since the phone is still relatively early in development (and the nature of us publishing information from a single source, no matter how reliable), anything we’re hearing about the next Pixel could become inaccurate or change by the time it launches — and that’s highlighted by details we’ve received about the chipset that the device will run. Our source says that multiple Pixel 2 models are being tested now with improved chipsets: “some with Snapdragon 83X chips, others with Intel chips.” We’re also told that MediaTek was at one point collaborating with Google on the Pixel 2, but isn’t any longer.

Finally, our source has indicated to us that Google is internally testing a “few” prototypes of a device they referred to as “Pixel 2B”, which would purportedly be released either “alongside or shortly after Pixel 2”. This phone would bring with it a lower-price point and less powerful hardware, and would be “aimed at different markets,” our source says. Google’s end goal is to bring the “Google experience and the Google Phone to emerging markets,” which is something the company definitely has shown a passion for in the past.

As for the price of the next Pixel, we’re told that — as of the time of this writing at least — Google is expecting that there will be “at least” a $50 USD increase in price. As for the budget-level “Pixel 2B,” we’re told this device “will be significantly cheaper” if it ever actually launches. As is the case with the rest of the details we’re sharing today, however, these price points are subject to change.

Update: Since publishing this article, we’ve received additional information on the device’s chipset situation. As was previously said to be in the works, Google did “develop a custom chipset for a test device,” but our source is unsure at this point if this custom chipset is coming to the Pixel 2. “Multiple test devices with different chipsets are being used now,” our source tells us.

Update 3/2/17: Google’s Rick Osterloh says “Pixel stays premium.”

Update 3/4/17: This same tipster has reached out to clarify the situation in light of Osterloh’s statements. While we interpreted the original tip to mean that it will be Pixel-branded, the source says that’s not necessarily the case and doubles-down in saying that there is indeed a “budget” device being worked on by the Pixel team. We’ve updated the headline of this article accordingly.

Here’s the full text of what we were told:

You should interpret “Budget Pixel” as a device that is being developed by the same team working on the Pixel 2, that is aimed at being released in emerging markets. This could mean Android One, this could mean something entirely different. My knowledge of this device is that: a.) it’s being developed alongside the Pixel 2 and b.) will not be sold in the US (assuming that it leaves the prototype stages).

So just to clarify something a little: there IS an Android One phone in the works for US. Our tipster sounds aware of something different. — Stephen Hall (@hallstephenj) March 6, 2017

Facebook Inc's (NASDAQ: FB ) virtual reality division Oculus has had a rough six months, but it looks as though the company is ready to to push VR in 2017 and turn things around. CEO Mark Zuckerberg took to Facebook last night to announce that Hugo Barra will be joining FB to lead VR efforts , including Oculus. If the name sounds familiar it should. Barra is very well known in the technology industry.

Source: Facebook

So who is Hugo Barra? He was in the news just last week when it was revealed he was leaving Chinese consumer technology giant Xiaomi .

He was hired in 2013 to lead that company's efforts to polish its image in western markets and help push its products into the U.S. market. At the time Barra said he was returning to his Silicon Valley roots, but gave no details.

What Does Hugo Barra Bring to FB?

Prior to Xiaomi, he served as Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google vice president of Android product management.

In his announcement of Barra's hire, Zuckerberg wrote:

""I'm excited that Hugo Barra is joining Facebook to lead all of our virtual reality efforts, including our Oculus team. Hugo's in China right now, so here we are together in VR. It seems fitting.

I've known Hugo for a long time, starting when he helped develop the Android operating system, to the last few years he's worked at Xiaomi in Beijing bringing innovative devices to millions of people. Hugo shares my belief that virtual and augmented reality will be the next major computing platform.""

FB's Oculus Challenges

When Facebook bought Oculus for $2 billion in 2014, the prospects for its new virtual reality division seemed limitless. But for the last six months, the division has been struggling.

Founder Palmer Luckey was bringing in bad press over his political views , complaints over the high prices for its Oculus Rift headset and the new Touch Controllers continued, and Sony Corp (ADR) (NYSE: SNE ) unexpectedly began to gain traction with both consumers and game developers with its much more affordable Playstation VR. In December, Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe stepped down. Now, FB and Luckey are tied up in a lawsuit claiming the Oculus founder stole trade secrets and violated copyrights in order to develop his Oculus Rift VR headset.

On top of all this, the hype over virtual reality is beginning to fade. After being a major part of past Consumer Electronics shows, there was a feeling that VR wasn't particularly compelling at CES 2017 .

In short, it's understandable why FB wants to kickstart Oculus. An industry veteran like Hugo Barra -someone who is experienced in leading a critical division in a technology giant and skilled at promotion - may well be the answer.

Kickstarting Oculus

When Barra takes over at Oculus, there are a few immediate challenges to take on. The lawsuit will have to be dealt with, but FB lawyers will be able to manage most of that.

The bigger issue in terms of getting consumers to buy into the Oculus rift is pricing. The Oculus Rift already has mindshare as the VR headset people think of. But where the Oculus Rift was once pretty much the only game in town, every major consumer technology company - except Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) - is offering virtual reality gear, and it's almost always cheaper.

That wouldn't be such a big deal if you were looking at $100 versus $75. But an Oculus Rift plus Touch Controllers goes for $798. Then you need a reasonably powerful PC (many computer owners would have to upgrade), which is at least another $1,000. In comparison, a complete Sony Playstation VR system (including the PS4) can be had for about $800. However, the Playstation VR headset is compatible with the original PS4 - which many gamers already own, so that brings their investment to just $500.

Largely as a result of those cost differences, it's estimated Sony will have sold over 745,000 Playstation VR systems in 2016 , while projections are for the Oculus Rift to hit just 355,000.

The hire of Hugo Barra sets the stage for FB to aggressively promote the technical superiority of its Oculus virtual reality technology over that used by competitors like Sony. It's also a good move in promoting developer relations in an effort to boost the Oculus' lead in compelling VR content. And if he can find some wiggle room to get Oculus Rift pricing down a bit, Barra stands a good chance of turning things around for Facebook's virtual reality division in 2017.

As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

(RTTNews.com) - Alphabet Inc., (GOOG, GOOGL), the parent company of Google, Thursday reported an increase in profit for the fourth quarter, reflecting largely revenue growth in search and advertising. Earnings for the quarter fell short of Wall Street expectations, due to higher revenue costs.

Alphabet's fourth-quarter profit rose to $5.33 billion or $7.56 per share from $4.92 billion or $7.06 per share last year.

Adjusted earnings for the quarter rose to $9.36 per share from $8.67 per share last year. On average, 35 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters estimated earnings of $9.67 per share for the quarter.

The company said aggregate paid clicks increased 36 percent year-over-year and 20 percent from last quarter. Paid clicks on Google websites jumped 43 from last year and 23 percent from previous quarter.

Meanwhile, aggregate cost-per-click dropped 15 percent from a year ago and 9 percent from prior quarter.

""Our growth in the fourth quarter was exceptional -- with revenues up 22% year on year and 24% on a constant currency basis. This performance was led by mobile search and YouTube. We're seeing great momentum in Google's newer investment areas and ongoing strong progress in Other Bets,"" said Ruth Porat, CFO of Alphabet.

Cost of revenues for the quarter increased from $8.19 billion a year ago to $10.66 billion a year ago.

GOOG closed Thursday's trading at $832.15, down $3.52 or 0.42% on the Nasdaq. The stock further slipped $18.30 or 2.20% in the after-hours trading.

Google parent Alphabet (GOOG) reported another strong set of financial results Thursday, beating Wall Street’s fourth quarter revenue estimates, which grew 22% year over year, thanks to the company’s continued dominance in advertising.

Over the past couple of quarters, the Mountain View, Calif.-based tech giant has been working to offset declining mobile advertising value with higher clicks. The rate of revenue and earnings growth suggests that this strategy continues to pay off.

In the three months that ended December, Alphabet reported a net income rose to $5.33 billion, or $7.56 per, up from $4.92 billion, or $7.06 per share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, when taking out one-time gains and costs, earnings were $9.36 per share, which misses estimates of $9.64 per share. Fourth quarter revenue rose 22% to $26.06 billion, easily topping Street forecast of $25.23 billion.

“Our growth in the fourth quarter was exceptional -- with revenues up 22% year on year and 24% on a constant currency basis. This performance was led by mobile search and YouTube,” said CFO Ruth Porat in a statement. “We’re seeing great momentum in Google’s newer investment areas and ongoing strong progress in Other Bets.”

Indeed, advertising revenue — up 17% to $19 billion — remains the company’s bread-and-butter business, accounting for some 90% of revenue. Google has, however, begun to show strength is its “Other Bets” — a segment that includes autonomous vehicles, virtual/augment reality headsets, its cloud business and, more recently, its smartphones. Revenue in that group came in at $262 million, surging 75% year over year from $150 million a year ago.

Google’s cost-per-click, a key metric determining the value of an ad, fell 11% year-over-year this quarter. But aggregate paid clicks increased 20%, showing that the management continue to find ways to offset the decline. As have been the case for some time, the primary growth driver continues to be the strength in search and YouTube. Notably, Google Cloud, which hopes to compete with Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT), has begun to show meaningful revenue growth.

Google websites revenue rose 20% to $17.9 billion, while Google Network revenues increase 7% to $4.4 billion. As with the strong showing the third quarter, paid clicks on Google websites were up 43% year over year. Alphabet did not provide a forecast, but the consensus first-quarter 2017 estimates call for EPS of $9.34 on revenues of $23.74 billion. For the full year analysts forecast EPS of $41.07 on revenues of $104.07 billion.

Alphabet stock traded lower on the report, down by about 2.5% at $834 in after-hours trading. I see this as a solid buying opportunity. With some patience, GOOGL stock should reach $1,050 in 2017, delivering 23% returns.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The world's biggest and most recognizable all-things-internet name Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) reported its fourth-quarter numbers after the bell, and they fell unusually short of estimates.

For the quarter ending in December, the company formerly known as Google earned $9.36 per share versus expectations of $9.63 .

Alphabet's top line of $26.06 billion compares favorably to analyst predictions for revenue of $25.22 billion. The company reported a profit of $8.67 per share of GOOGL stock in the same quarter from a year earlier, when it drove sales of $21.33 billion.

The numbers interrupt a long-term streak of forward, even if not perfect, fiscal progress. Alphabet has topped estimates in five of the past seven quarters.

CFO Ruth Porat commented on the Alphabet earnings report:

""Our growth in the fourth quarter was exceptional - with revenues up 22% year on year and 24% on a constant currency basis. This performance was led by mobile search and YouTube. We're seeing great momentum in Google's newer investment areas and ongoing strong progress in Other Bets.""

GOOGL shares were 2.1% lower in after-hours trading.

New Focus on Hardware Going Well

Alphabet, while it was still called Google, was founded primarily as a web search engine, and that's still the lion's share of its revenue mix. Though aggregate cost-per-click fell, continuing a long (and industry-wide) trend of deterioration, with another 9% year-over-year decline, that dip continues to be more than offset by a sheer increase of volume.

Aggregate paid clicks grew 20% on a year-over-year basis. Google - the search engine and its ancillary products and services - contributed $25.8 billion worth of last quarter's revenue, and was responsible for $7.88 billion of the $8.5 billion in Alphabet's operating income.

Although search and ads are still its bread-and-butter business, the company has recently begun the development of hardware and Internet of Things devices. The highest-profile of these new initiatives is the so-called Pixel phone. Although the company had brought smartphones to the market in the past - like the Nexus - those were mostly third-party/branded handsets. The Pixel is a true, home-grown, in-house smartphone from Google that's designed to take aim at the popular iPhone line from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ).

Bloomberg recently reported that Alphabet sold an estimated 1 million Pixels last quarter ; the company doesn't provide such details. That doesn't even come close to the 45.5 million iPhones Apple sold last quarter , but it's a very good first effort.

The Pixel is just one way Alphabet has remained relevant as consumers continue to migrate from desktops to mobile devices. Its Android operating system is now the OS of choice on nearly 90% of all handheld devices sold, funneling users to Google's apps, services and revenue-bearing display ads.

Digital Is Still Important

And the company is getting serious about squeezing more revenue out of its Google Play store. Going forward, Chromebooks will run all Android apps , making Chromebooks as well as more of its apps more marketable. The move poses a threat to the current king of laptop/notebook operating systems Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ).

YouTube was another bright spot for Alphabet during its fourth fiscal quarter.

Although garnering traffic has never been a problem for the online-video venue ( the site attracts more than 30 million viewers per day, who collectively watch nearly 5 billion clips every day ), optimizing the ad revenue YouTube generates has proven difficult. The organization seems to have finally found a winning formula though.

Again, Alphabet doesn't provide such specifics, but RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney estimated that YouTube generates $10 billion in annual ad revenue , or roughly a tenth of the company's total revenue. Porat also made a point of saying Mobile Search and YouTube led the company's revenue growth for the quarter.

Looking Ahead for GOOGL Stock

Just within the past few days, two experts have chimed in with bullish expectations for GOOGL shares. Specifically, Pacific Crest began coverage of Alphabet last week with a price target of $1,030 , and this week, Barron's opined GOOGL shares could reach $1,000 before the end of 2017. Those targets are approximately 20% higher than where the stock closed on Thursday.

Analysts expect Alphabet to earn $41.07 per share this year, on $104.07 billion in revenue. Those figures are 19% and 16% higher, respectively, than 2016's tally. Nothing about last quarter's numbers suggests the company won't reach those targets.

As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Temasek Holdings Pte Ltd, a state-owned firm, is investing $800 million in Verily, according to a statement from the company Thursday. In exchange, Temasek will get a minority stake in Verily and a seat on its operating board.

“With a substantial network and insights into the economies in Asia, Temasek will provide valuable guidance as we look to ex-U.S. markets with our development partners,” Verily Chief Executive Officer Andrew Conrad, said in the statement.

Temasek’s investment supports the move by Alphabet CEO Larry Page to run each of his subsidiaries as independent companies. The units, which work in disparate industries, vary in their autonomy from Google’s infrastructure and corporate support. To date, Verily has been funded by Google’s massive advertising revenue.

The agreement could also signal Verily’s plans to expand into China. About 23 percent of Temasek’s portfolio is in China, the largest by underlying asset exposure after Singapore, according to the company. Google pulled most of its services from China in 2010, citing political reasons. But Alphabet has not said whether this ban applies to the other companies under its umbrella.

Verily aims to develop software and hardware for the healthcare field. The group debuted Google’s experimental research lab with a smart contact lens that measures glucose. It has since expanded to a myriad of medical projects, ranging from specialized spoons for Parkinson’s disease patients and recently to a sterile mosquito breeding effort to combat the Zika virus.

The company primarily makes money through licensing. It has cut deals with several traditional pharmaceutical companies such as Novartis AG, which is developing the contact lens, and Biogen Inc. Verily has also funded a robotic surgery company with Johnson & Johnson and started a bio-electronics joint venture with GlaxoSmithKline Plc.

Verily resides in the tech giant’s so-called Other Bets bucket, the corporate units apart from Google. Verily is one of three in the group that brings in revenue, the company has said. Smart-home device maker Nest and high-speed internet service Google Fiber are the other two. Altogether, the Other Bets unit generated $197 million in revenue during the third quarter.

In 2015, Alphabet put $869 million in capital spending into the Other Bet companies.

Temasek is an investment company based in Singapore, with investments across a wide range of industries and global offices around the world. The investment firm is described in a press release as focusing on companies tackling long-term trends, and Verily definitely fits the bill with its efforts to address issues like deteriorating vision and Parkinson’s disease.

Verily is also doing work on disease detection, including via efforts to bring to life a real-world Tricorder, mimicking the fictional performance of the device with the same name depicted in the Star Trek franchise. Stat News reported last year that Verily’s efforts on this front weren’t turning out quite as hoped, however.

Still, Verily’s portfolio also includes a project to establish a healthy baseline for human beings, down to the genetic level, as well as develop a health tracking wristband designed for actually monitoring patients as a prescription device, and efforts to help develop ever more advanced surgical assistance robots. It’s also looking to build better bugs (actual insects) in an effort to combat disease transmission.

The investment will result in Temasek getting a minority stake in Verily, and Temasek will also get to nominate one of its own as a board member for the Alphabet-owned company. Verily CEO Andrew Conrad also noted in the press release announcing the investment that Temasek will help the company strategically as it looks to build out its business in Asia and beyond the U.S.

Verily is moving towards more commercialization of its work through this new investment, and it’s not the only Alphabet subsidiary to begin to pursue commercial applications of its work with more apparent urgency. Waymo, which previously existed as Google’s Self-Driving Car project, also recently took a number of steps towards making its primarily research-focused organization more of a potential revenue center.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The company banned the publishers from its AdSense network, an ad placement service that automatically serves text and display ads on participating sites based on its audience. The ban was part of an update to an existing policy that prohibits sites that mislead users with their content.

Google regularly weeds out advertisers for false or misleading claims, but impersonating news sites became an addition following the rapid rise of fake news, or propaganda sites. After the election, Google was blasted for placing a false story from a fake news site claiming Donald Trump had won the popular vote. (He had 2.8 million fewer votes than Hillary Clinton.)

Not all 200 publishers were swept up as part of the effort to root out fake news sites.

Publishers were banned in November and December and included sites that impersonate real news organizations through shortened top-level domains, according to Google’s 2016 “bad ads” report, normally released at the beginning of each year.

So-called fake news publishers will sometimes take advantage of “.co” domains by appearing similar to legitimate news sites that would normally end in “.com.”

Google declined to provide a listing of the banned sites.

Separately, the annual report on violations of advertising policy also included data on ads removed by Google. The company reported that in 2016 it took down 1.7 billion ads for violations, compared to 780 million in 2015.

Google attributes the increase in ad removals to a combination of advertiser behavior and improvements in technology to detect offending ads.

Google added a policy mid-year to prohibit ads for payday loans, considered predatory. Roughly five million payday loan ads were disabled over the latter six months of 2016.

Also among those the removed ads were what Google calls “tabloid cloakers.” These advertisers run what look like links to news headlines, but when the user clicks, an ad for a product such as a weight loss supplement pops up. Google suspended 1,300 accounts engaged in tabloid cloaking in 2016.

Correction: the original headline stated 200 publishers were banned in a three month period, when it was actually less than two months.

Fake news wasn’t the biggest media problem of 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1/25/2017,0.514199642,0.088789963,829.62,835.77,825.06,835.67,1627304,10.71,6.05,1,"Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of those companies that receives a lot of coverage with a wide range of price targets. While it is difficult to peg a price target on Alphabet with traditional valuation methods, I believe there is sufficient evidence that a large margin of safety exists at the current price level. I like to frame the opportunity something like this: Alphabet's Google division alone can easily justify the current stock price of a little more than $800 per share, with the venture capital arm and ""other bets"" essentially trading for free.

Google division easily worth $800 per share

With revenue growth around 20% and a forward PE of near 20 after accounting for the net cash on the balance sheet, the valuation is very reasonable (and this includes the losses from Other Bets). The secular growth in online advertising revenue is showing no signs of slowing down. The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) reported in their Internet Advertising Revenue Report that online advertising has increased at a 17% clip since 2005, and was up 20% YoY in 2015. Mobile ad growth is the primary reason for the recent acceleration.

The pace has kept up thus far in 2016. IAB reported in their Q3 2016 update that internet ad revenues climbed 20% YoY again in the quarter. Alphabet appears to be holding their market share, even with the surging Facebook, as they also announced similar revenue growth during the Q3 period.

Surging internet ad revenue has come at the expense of the traditional media outlets, a trend expected to continue. Adding the broadcast and cable television lines together in the graph above you see that in 2015 internet ad revenue has caught up to television ad revenue. We will see internet ad revenue surpass broadcast and cable revenue for the first time in 2016.

In addition to being the most dominant player in search, Google has yet to seriously monetize their YouTube and Maps platforms, both of which have over one billion monthly users. Google is set up well to at least maintain their market share in fast growing interned advertising space, making a 20 P/E multiple look like a bargain.

I love me some free options:

While it is easier to illustrate why the downside at this price is limited for Alphabet, it is much harder to estimate a fair value. This is because the company has so many other bets spread around, each with option-like payoff profiles. What I mean by this is that the payoff on each investment is very similar to that of an out-of-the-money call option. The cost to acquire the option is small, but the most likely scenario is a loss of the capital invested. However, there is a small probability that payoff could be huge and uncapped. The more bets Alphabet makes into these potentially disruptive technologies and innovations, the more likely one of them turns into a home run. The payoffs of these bets are highly uncertain, but getting them for free is clearly a great value.

Autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence, drone delivery, robotics and new forms of high-speed internet services are just a few examples of some of these other bets that could potentially yield high payoffs. Additionally, the venture capital arm could strike it rich with a timely investment in the next disruptive technology.

There are also plenty of bets going on inside of the Google division, which too are not properly valued in the share price. Of these, cloud services probably has the biggest potential. Google recently introduced Google Cloud as a new business unit that includes their collaboration and productivity applications, machine learning and data analytics tools, and application program interfaces. Google's access to vast amounts of data and their advancements and investments in machine learning and artificial intelligence should prove a compelling value proposition for cloud customers.

Revenues from Google's cloud services are not broken out from the rest of Google revenues in their SEC filings, but management has indicated that cloud is growing quickly and that they are investing heavily. In Q3, Google other revenue (the line cloud rolls up under) was $2.4 billion, up 39% YoY with the growth explained on the earnings call as ""driven by Play and Cloud"" and that the cloud platform had the largest YoY growth of any revenue line.

Another signal from the earnings call that shows how much the company is investing in cloud is headcount growth, which grew 5% in Q3 alone, to 69,953. CFO Ruth Porat clarified that the ""vast majority of new hires were engineers and product managers to support growth in priority areas such as cloud.""

If even a modest market share were eventually carved out in this fast growing and highly profitable space, the effect on the stock price could be quite large. In their semi-annual Public Cloud Customer Research report, TBR forecasts that the public cloud market will reach $167B by 2020. In the report TBR also estimates that Google cloud revenues were $2.8B in 2015, or roughly 3.4% of the market. Based on the clues from the earnings calls I think we can assume cloud revenues are currently growing at an over 50% annual rate for Google. While perhaps not the base case, it is not unfathomable that Google could carve out a 10% market share by 2020. Using the TBR market estimates, this would be $16.7 billion in revenue. Applying a price-to-sales multiple of 6 we could be looking at a $100 billion cloud business by 2020. This free option is hard to pass up.

Key Risks:

While Alphabet has a lot of opportunities for growth in new markets outside of advertising, the advertising business is still the engine that allows the company the luxury of making so many investments in early stage technologies. While I believe the fundamentals for owning Alphabet as these levels is strong, a prudent investor should keep a careful eye on revenue growth and margins to make sure the core advertising cash flow engine stays healthy.

Revenue : I'd like to see advertising revenue continue to increase at a 15%-20% rate (before currency translation). The key metrics to monitor for advertising revenue are the aggregate change in paid clicks and the cost per click. Paid clicks has continued to trend up, rising 30% YoY in the first nine months of 2016. During the same period cost per click trended down 9%, likely due to increased competition from social media, a phenomenon seen across the industry. A slowdown in net advertising revenue growth below 15% in the next year would cause me to re-evaluate my thesis. Social media's share of internet ad spend also shouldn't be ignored, and warrants monitoring.

Social media's share of internet ad spend also shouldn't be ignored, and warrants monitoring. Margins: The key metric I recommend watching here are traffic acquisition costs. These costs have been trending up, due mainly to the growing mix of mobile traffic. Higher traffic acquisition costs for mobile is primarily due to paying Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to make Google the default search engine on the iPhone.

Conclusion:

Buy Alphabet's core Google business right now at a fair price, which has it's own upside potential from the continued secular growth of online advertising and the under-monetization of the Maps and YouTube businesses. Get for free all of the other bets and their inherent option-like payoffs profiles. Use your own judgment on the likelihood one or more of these bets succeed, along with the size of the prize, to gauge just how undervalued Alphabet is.

Alphabet GOOGL, +1.10% GOOG, +1.28% is expected to show an increase in ad revenues despite ongoing pricing pressure exasperated by a decline in the amount Google receives when customers interact with an ad, a metric called cost per click. Management will likely be upbeat on the growth of video engagement and sales of its artificial intelligence products.

This quarter will also be the first to include sales of the Pixel smartphone, which was released in October. Not all analysts are convinced the new Android phone performed well in a market saturated with the likes of Apple Inc.’s AAPL, +0.22% iPhone and Samsung Electronics’ 005930, +0.48% Galaxy line.

Here’s what to expect:

Earnings: Sell-side analysts surveyed by FactSet expect Alphabet to report adjusted profit of $9.64 a share, compared with $8.67 in the year-earlier period. Contributors to Estimize, a software platform that uses crowdsourcing from hedge fund executives, brokerages and buy-side analysts to predict earnings, expect Alphabet to report adjusted earnings of $9.76 a share. The company has surpassed both consensus estimates in four of the past five quarters.

Watch: Google’s self-driving cars equipped with new sensors

Revenue: The company is expected to report revenue of $20.6 billion, compared with $17.3 billion in the year-earlier period, according to the FactSet and Estimize consensus estimates. Alphabet has topped both expectations in three of the past four quarters.

Stock reaction: Shares of Alphabet have underperformed the market since its last earnings report, increasing 3% in the past three months and 16% in the past year. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.11% , by comparison, is up 7% in three months and 22% on the year. The average rating on Alphabet’s stock is the equivalent to buy, while the average 12-month price target is $960.59, according to a FactSet survey of roughly 30 analysts. Shares of Alphabet closed $858.45 at Wednesday. They traded down 0.4% to $854.79 Thursday afternoon.

What to watch for: This will be the first quarter to highlight Pixel smartphone sales, the company’s iPhone rival that sells at a similarly premium price point. In a note to clients last week, Mizuho analyst Neil Doshi raised his estimate on Alphabet’s Pixel phone to 1 million units for the quarter. The Pixel outlook prompted Mizuho to raise its revenue estimate slightly, to $20.5 billion from $19.9 billion.

Will augmented reality or virtual reality win? (3:11) Augmented and virtual reality are growing into multibillion-dollar businesses that will transform how users shop, work and communicate. Intel, HTC, Lenovo and Alphabet showed their latest innovations at CES in Las Vegas.

However, Doshi, who has a buy rating and $1,025 target on the stock, said he’s “somewhat skeptical that the Pixel can gain material near-term share,” particularly since Verizon is the only wireless carrier that sells the phone to its customers. The global smartphone industry has decelerated significantly in recent years as customers wait longer to upgrade their phones and purchase unlocked and refurbished phones from third-party retail sites.

Meanwhile, Google continues to face advertising pressure amid declines in its core search product. The growth of paid clicks on ads across its sites is expected to increase 26.2% this quarter, according to the FactSet estimate. That would mark a deceleration from 33% last quarter and 31% in the year-earlier period.

To win the competition, one of these finalists has to be the first to launch a spacecraft to the Moon by December 31st, 2017, and then explore the lunar surface.

The groups spread from the US West Coast to Japan

The five teams moving ahead are SpaceIL, Moon Express, Synergy Moon, Team Indus, and Hakuto, according to an announcement by the X Prize Foundation today. The groups are based in various countries across the globe, spread from the US West Coast to Japan. In order to advance to this stage of the competition, each team had to secure a verified launch contract before the end of 2016. That entailed booking a rocket to launch the team’s spacecraft in 2017 and then having that launch contract verified by the X Prize Foundation.

The first group to get one of these verified contracts was the Israel-based team SpaceIL. In October 2015, SpaceIL announced that its lunar lander, named Sparrow, would ride to space as a secondary payload on one of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rockets by the second half of 2017. The next to secure a contract was Moon Express based out of California, which has a long-term ambition of mining the Moon for resources. The company announced in December 2015 that its MX-1E lander would launch on top of a smaller, experimental rocket called the Electron, manufactured by aerospace startup Rocket Lab. The Electron has yet to fly for the first time, but test launches are supposed to happen sometime in early 2017. Moon Express has also received approval from the US government to fly its mission.

The remaining three teams secured launch contracts in the second half of 2016. Synergy Moon, an international team made up of members from more than 15 different countries, announced in August that it would be launching its lunar lander and rover on top of a Neptune 8 rocket. That vehicle is being manufactured by Interorbital Systems, but like the Electron, the rocket has yet to fly to space.

Team Indus and Hakuto have decided to share a ride to space

As for the India-based Team Indus and Japan-based team Hakuto, the two have decided to share a ride to space. Team Indus booked a ride for its lunar lander and rover on a PSLV rocket — a proven vehicle developed by India’s space agency, the Indian Space Research Organization. However, it turned out that Team Indus had room to spare on its spacecraft, so the group struck a deal with Hakuto. Team Indus’ lander will now carry the Japanese team’s rover to the Moon as well.

Today’s announcement means that a few other hopefuls are no longer officially in the race. One team based out of Germany called Part-Time Scientists was seemingly close to advancing to the next round, too. The group announced at the end of November that it had signed a contract with Spaceflight Industries, a company that helps find rockets for spacecraft launchings. The deal was for PT Scientists’ rover to launch as a secondary payload on a yet unidentified rocket, according to Space News, but it seems that the contract was not officially verified by X Prize before last year’s deadline.

Established in 2007, the Google Lunar X Prize is just one of many global contests created by the X Prize Foundation aimed at addressing specific needs for society. Other competitions have focused on mitigating the effects of climate change or improving health care, but the ultimate goal of the Google Lunar X Prize is to come up with ways of lowering the cost of spaceflight. That’s why the teams in the competition have been challenged with privately funding their missions; each group cannot get more than 10 percent of its funding from government sources.

The teams also have to meet certain mission requirements in order to take home the grand prize. Not only do the spacecraft need to land on the Moon intact, but the vehicles also need to travel at least 500 meters on the lunar surface. To fulfill that requirement, most teams have built rovers, while SpaceIL and Moon Express have taken a different approach by designing landers that “hop” across the Moon. Additionally, all the spacecraft must send back photos from the lunar surface, and provide live video “Mooncasts.”

To win any of the competition’s prizes, a team must initiate its mission to the Moon by December 31st, 2017

Now that the final teams have been verified, time is quickly running out to accomplish all of these tasks. Teams must launch their missions to the Moon by December 31st 2017, in order to win any of the competition’s prizes. Originally, X Prize required the teams to have completed their Moon missions before December 31st in order to win, but X Prize recently updated the restriction “in recognition of the diverse mission plans of each finalist team.” The first team to fulfill all of the requirements will receive the grand prize of $20 million, while the second to do so will receive $5 million. Other cash prizes will be given for pulling off special tasks, such as visiting an Apollo landing site.

However, all 16 teams, including the ones that didn’t advance to the next round, will be receiving a money prize, too. X Prize announced today that groups would all be splitting a $1 million “Diversity Prize” as a reward for their “unique approaches” to spaceflight and all the educational outreach that the teams have done leading up to the final stage of the competition. “Each of these teams has pushed the boundaries to demonstrate that you don’t have to be a government superpower to send a mission to the Moon, while inspiring audiences to pursue the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics,” Chanda Gonzales-Mowrer, senior director of the Google Lunar X Prize, said in a statement.

""What happened?"" It's a question often posed to celebrity crushes that are now decades past their prime. And it seems like an appropriate inquiry for Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ). GOOG stock is the anchor among the so-called ""FANG"" stocks, which include Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ), Amazon.com, Inc . (NASDAQ: AMZN ), and the hot-running Netflix, Inc . (NASDAQ: NFLX ). Arguably, GOOG is the most culturally significant of the bunch, yet its recent performance has left a lot to be desired.

Source: Shutterstock

For 2016, GOOG stock returned a whopping 4% even. To put that underperformance into perspective, Alphabet Inc gave shareholders 48% returns on average during the 2000s decade when it was first introduced to the markets.

Inclusive of last year, its lifetime average is now a little bit above 30%. In fact, compared to the other FANGs, GOOG stock is the absolute worst. And while it's almost identical to Facebook's overall performance, both Amazon and Netflix put Alphabet Inc to shame.

That's the kind of post-mortem talk you hear on CNBC when reality finally catches up to a speculative company. Certainly, it's not the kind of metric you expect from a bigger-than-life-itself organization like GOOGL. I mean, this is a company that was the centerpiece of a Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson movie - and they totally agreed to it!

But just like the movie's plot, outside appearances can be deceiving. Here are a few reasons why you should still give GOOG stock a chance.

GOOG Is More Than a Search Engine

First off, Alphabet Inc isn't just a search engine. Yes, I completely understand the argument that the vast, overwhelming majority of its multi-billion dollar business derives from advertisements. However, there are unmistakable signs of diversity.

As InvestorPlace contributor Will Ashworth points out , in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, ""GOOGL generated $2.4 billion in other revenues, 39% higher year-over-year and 12% sequentially. This represented 10.9% of the Google segment's overall revenue of $22.3 billion. For the first nine months of the year, Google's other revenues came to $6.7 billion, 31% higher than a year earlier."" Essentially, Alphabet Inc can spin off a brand new business separate from advertisements, and it would do just fine.

Indeed, GOOG stock is backed by coverage of over 157 products , according to another InvestorPlace colleague, Aaron Levitt. While a good chunk of the offerings are web-based applications, such as Gmail, Maps and Chrome, ""the firm has continued to plow some big-time dollars onto the physical device market."" As we move forward, GOOG stock may be less recognized as an app investment, and more as a consumer electronics investment similar to Apple Inc . (NASDAQ: AAPL ) or Sony Corp (ADR) (NYSE: SNE ).

As both Ashworth and Levitt note, diversification towards physical devices and non-core businesses don't necessarily endear folks to GOOG stock. Many of these divisions are money losers. The Motorola venture was a particularly rotten deal.

However, I wholeheartedly agree with Ashworth's thesis: ""As painful as it is for investors to see Alphabet pour good money after bad into its Other Bets, GOOGL stock depends on it. Because its legacy business likely won't be this profitable 10 years from now.""

Alphabet Inc Has the Ultimate Trump Card

Perhaps most analysts bullish towards GOOG stock have laid out similar arguments - Alphabet Inc is more than just a one trick pony. Considering all the evidence, it would be foolish to attempt to counter it. But allow me to shamelessly grab the ultra-low hanging fruit. Just what the heck is wrong with being a one trick pony?

We're not talking about Polaroid here.

By investing in GOOG stock, you are taking ownership in not only a massive company, but a cultural phenomenon.

Consider that among the most popular search engines on the internet, Google beats out second-best competitor Bing by a margin of 300%! Startlingly, the gap between first and fifth place is nearly 1,200%. Against the bottom run of the top ten, the gap is nearly 12,000%.

In other words, if you think that Google will ever be upended by anyone else, think again. No other investment besides GOOG stock has such dominance over their industries that people refer to it by the company name. We Google things on the web. And until the day I hear ""I'll iPhone you,"" people can rest assured in their GOOG position.

Put in the simplest of terms, unless there are Russian ICBMs raining down on us, I would never short GOOG stock. The only caveat would be to point out instances of potential technical weakness. Even then, the volatility would likely be on a short-term basis. As I stated above, Alphabet Inc has too much of a powerful brand to ever fail.

While we believe that its search company Google continued to dominate the online search ads market in 2016, its 'moonshot' (i.e., start-up) businesses, clubbed under other bets, are witnessing downsizing due to investment outlay.

In Q3, the company reported that its revenues grew by over 23% year over year to $22.45 billion. The performance measures for search, cost-per-click (CPC), continued to negatively impact growth. This decline was offset to some extent by the growth in aggregate clicks as Google's search products as adoption of its enhanced campaigns program continued to gain traction. This program, which combines ad marketing campaigns across mobile devices, desktops and laptops (i.e., across screens with different form factors), was instrumental in generating ad volume growth across both the display and search ad divisions.

In Q4, we believe that Google continued to focus on improving its display revenues from YouTube. Additionally, Google continued to sell more of the ads inventory through its programmatic platform, which is driving aggregate paid clicks and revenues across desktop and mobile verticals. However, the company continues to burn cash for its 'other bets' as the search for next multi-billion dollar money maker continues.

Google Revenue To Grow Despite Decrease In CPC

Trefis currently estimates that PC search ads and mobile search ads contribute over 46% to the firm's value. During the year, Cost per click (CPC), a metric that measures the price paid for the number of times a visitor clicks on a search ad, has been on a steady decline. For the first nine months, it declined by an aggregate 11.3% on Google websites and 6.7% on network member sites. Furthermore, aggregate cost per click declined by 9% during the quarter. The trend in Google's search ads business is indicative of geographical mix, device mix, currency headwinds and property mix. Furthermore, the growth of TrueView ads on YouTube and the advent of the video programming platform has negatively impacted CPCs, as has the DoubleClick Bid Manager, which monetizes at lower rates than ad clicks on Google.com.

Despite the decline in CPC, Alphabet continued to re-iterate in the year that its monetization rate for mobile devices has improved on the back of increased adoption of mobile ads. Furthermore, ad volume from mobile devices is growing. We believe that this trend will help the company to post growth in Q4 and for the 2016.

YouTube Ads To Add To Topline, Weigh On CPC

Trefis currently estimates that YouTube Ads contribute nearly 14% to the firm's value. In the previous quarter, the company reported that more than 1 billion monthly users are watching hundreds of millions of hours every single day. According to the company, YouTube has become the platform of choice for major brands, with a highly-engaged audience. Research also suggests that many users turn to YouTube to help them in making a decision about buying something by watching videos about it. Going forward, YouTube is an important growth driver for Google as online video ads are expected to grow exponentially. YouTube is forecast to record 3.5 trillion video views during 2016. Since online video remains a fast-growing segment within the overall digital ad market, we expect this to translate into high-revenue growth rate for the company in Q4 and in the ensuing year.

However, Google is focusing on its video programmatic businesses including AdMob, AdExchange, DoubleClick Bid Manager, and these continue to grow at a strong rate. As Google is increasingly looking to monetize the video content through its programmatic platform, Trefis anticipates that CPC (Revenue per search) will continue to decline in Q4 and over the ensuing years. This will result in a lower than expected growth in topline. Although growth in search volume will likely offset the decline in Q4.

Mobile Content And Hardware Sales Set To Fillip Revenue

Google, with 85% market share, dominates the mobile operating system market. The Android OS continues to witness excellent adoption and penetration in the smartphone market with the release of each subsequent version. The widespread adoption of Android will bolsters Google search as a user with an Android phone is more likely to use Google search compared to a user using another OS. Additionally, a user on an android phone is expected to download content from Google Play store, which helped the company to report growth in revenue from content in the first nine months of the year. In order to ensure that the company's flagship OS continues to rule the roost, Google has launched artificial intelligence based Assistant app that helps users with advanced search. Its mobile services like Now on Tap, which essentially uses machine learning, lets user access additional useful information based on recent search and present location. Last week, the company acquired Twitter's Fabric, a platform that helps mobile teams to build apps and analyse usage. We believe that, as Google's mobile strategy for content and ads continues to evolve, the ads and content revenues will increase in coming years. Nevertheless, the company will report increase in revenue for its Play store and mobile ads business during this Q4's earnings report, in our expectatation.

During the year, Alphabet launched the Pixel smartphone to defend its mobile search ad business. With the introduction of the Pixel, the firm is looking to create a solid Android alternative to the iPhone, potentially allowing it to win over affluent customers. We expect that the company will disclose the sales number for its Pixel line of Smartphone during this earnings announcement. This will help us to ascertain whether the company was able to compete with Apple's iPhone in 2016.

Performance Of Other Bets

Its Other bets segment, which includes Fiber, Verily, Calico, Nest, self-driving cars, and other businesses, reported revenue of $548 million and operating losses of $2.23 billion for the first nine months of the year. Other Bets capital expenditures were $884 million, primarily reflecting investment in the Fiber business. Over the past few months, Alphabet is scaling back its support for money-losing ""moonshot"" ventures to rein in costs and make these businesses accountable for their operations. Despite these efforts, we believe that these businesses will continue to bleed cash in Q4 and 2016, albeit at a slower rate.

We currently have a $821 price estimate for Alphabet , which is inline with the current market price.

While overall revenues remained almost flat at 53.33 trillion won ($45.8 billion) , operating profits expanded by about 50% to 9.22 trillion won ($7.9 billion).

Semiconductor Unit Outperforms On Tight Supply And Samsung's High-End Focus

Samsung's semiconductor business had a solid quarter, with revenues rising by 12.5% to 14.86 trillion won ($12.74 billion), and operating profits growing by about 77% to a record 4.95 trillion won ($4.24 billion), driven largely by the memory business. Supply-demand conditions in the memory market have been tight, with mobile OEMs increasing memory content on devices, effectively bolstering demand for NAND modules, while PC DRAM is seeing some under-supply, as major vendors have been reducing their production mix in favor of mobile DRAM, boosting prices. While Samsung has been benefiting from the broader market tailwinds, the company's technology edge and its focus on higher value products also appear to be paying off.

For instance, Samsung is focusing on high density/performance DRAM over commodity DRAM, while expanding process migration to the 48-layer 3D V-NAND. Samsung is looking improve its process technologies further in 2017, migrating to to 1x-nm DRAM and 64-layer V-NAND, driving down costs. The company's system LSI business, which manufactures processors, also aided Q4 earnings, driven by strong demand for mid-to-low end app processors. 2017 is expected to be an important year for the LSI division, as Samsung looks to ramp-up production of the next generation 10-nm products from its foundry operations. These chips, which could be a fixture of high-end smartphones in 2017, are touted to be more battery efficient, while offering better performance and a smaller form factor.

Smartphone Business Largely Shrugs Off Note 7 Impact

Samsung's smartphone division fared reasonably well, despite the Note 7 recall which occurred in late Q3. Although segment revenues declined by about 5.5% year-over-year to 23.61 trillion won ($20.27 billion), operating profits rose by about 12% to 2.5 trillion won ($2.15 billion). Profitability for the quarter was aided by strong sales of the company's flagship Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, which have higher margins, as well as sales of its mid-range smartphones such as the A and J series. That said, things are likely to remain subdued over Q1 2017, as Samsung is increasing its marketing spending in order to rebuild its brand following the Note 7 crisis. Moreover, the company's upcoming Galaxy S8 flagship is likely to launch in Q2, moving away from the March launch cycle that the company adopted with the S7. The upcoming device will be crucial to Samsung, as the company looks to restore its image as a vendor of cutting-edge smartphones, while contending with increasing competition in the high-end of the smartphone market as Apple preps to launch a completely redesigned iPhone later this year, while Google ramps up sales and distribution of its critically acclaimed Pixel devices.

Leading the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) rumor mill today is news of improvements to Siri. Today, we'll look at that and other Apple Rumors for Tuesday.

Siri Upgrade : A new report claims that Siri will be getting an upgrade when the 2017 iPhone comes out , AppleInsider notes. According to this report, the upgrade for Siri will enhance the virtual assistant so that it can better compete against others. The report claims that this update to Siri will be released with the launch of iOS 11, which will likely show up at the Worldwide Developers Conference this year. As it is now, Siri can't quite keep up with virtual assistants from Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , GOOGL ) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ).

Find My AirPods : The new iOS 10.3 beta includes a feature to help users find their missing AirPods , reports MacRumors . This new feature is called ""Find My AirPods"" and it is designed to help owners of the wireless headphones keep track of them. The new beta also includes updates for HomeKit, CarPlay and more. It is available to developers registered with Apple. The beta comes out just one day after the tech company released the final version of iOS 10.2.1.

macOS Sierra 10.12.4 : The first beta for macOS Sierra 10.12.4 is now available to developers , 9to5Mac notes. The beta for macOS Sierra 10.12.4 includes several new features. The biggest one is the addition of a Night Shift feature. This lets users set their devices to slowly shift colors as the time changes. The feature has already been present on Apple's mobile devices for about one year. The beta also includes an update for Siri so users can ask about cricket scores. PDFKit APIs also got an update to improve the display of PDFs in apps with framework.

Either poor service or a low quality product, the end result was always the desire to do less business with the given company.

However, on the other side of the coin, there are those companies out there that go above and beyond, time and time again. Those are the companies I like to frequent, and I have always wondered if these types of firms-which have a long history of satisfying their customers-end up making better investments too.

Well, in this edition of the Dutram Report , I talk to Kevin Quigg, chief strategist of ACSI Funds, for some insights into this topic and if this idea works as an investment.

Inside ACSI

Kevin is an expert in the American Customer Satisfaction Index, a benchmark that exists to find companies that customers either like, or would rather avoid. This is done by looking at a few key areas of the customer satisfaction process, including customer expectations, perceived value, and perceived quality.

This data has proven to be extremely popular with companies, as it helps them to keep tabs on the competition and to see their relative standing among their peers too. But the data can also be used to shape the outlook for companies and to see how they are trending in terms of customer satisfaction, which can help to show which companies are moving in the right direction.

ACSI's idea is that customer satisfaction leads to customer loyalty, which leads to additional consumer spending which ultimately leads to long-term stock appreciation. This intuitively makes sense, and now there is a way to use this strategy in ETF form.

The ETF

This is via ACSI Funds' American Customer Satisfaction Core Alpha ETF (ACSI). This product holds securities that have high ACSI customer satisfaction scores, with the theory being that these will outperform their low-satisfaction peers.

Current holdings include well-respected names like Apple (AAPL), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Alphabet (GOOG) just to name a few, though there are dozens of names in the portfolio. And if you are wondering what is done for sectors where customer satisfaction levels aren't as readily available, such as energy or materials, big ETFs-such as XLE or XLB-are utilized in order to give more market-like exposure.

GOOGL , as the tech giant prepares to release its fourth-quarter earnings report on Thursday. The company rolled out its new Google Pixel phone and ushered in a new era of hardware-software interaction during the quarter, making this week's announcement even more important than usual.

In fact, the Google Pixel will most likely be the most compelling aspect of Alphabet's latest report, and investors will be clamoring to know how the device sold. It will also be interesting to see what the company says about its Google Home Controller, which also launched in the U.S. this quarter.

The Google Pixel is important because it is Alphabet's first high-end smartphone entirely produced in-house and represents a significant challenge to Apple's AAPL iPhone line. The Google Home tells another story of competition; the ""Internet of Things"" in-home hub is one of the only competitors to Amazon's AMZN Echo speaker.

More importantly, both of these products underscore Alphabet's efforts to usher in its intelligent personal assistant software, Google Assistant. With similar functions to Apple's Siri and Microsoft's MSFT Cortana, Google Assistant is the backbone of the Pixel and Home devices and promises to be the foundation for all of Google's original products heading forward.

Also, investors should not forget about the other products that Google launched in the quarter, all of which were officially unveiled at the same event in October. The company debuted its stylish headset for the Daydream VR platform, the ""Daydream View,"" as well as its first router, ""Google Wifi,"" and a Chromecast update, ""Chromecast Ultra.""

All of these products are important pieces of Google's effort to create a complete line of products that work together and with the new Google Assistant software. This is just the first quarter of sales, but it is also the holiday quarter and should give us a good idea of whether or not these products are resonating with shoppers.

Heading into the report, Alphabet Inc. has seen one positive estimate revision over the past week. Our current consensus estimates indicate EPS growth of 8.40% and sales growth of 18.75%, and this has helped earn the company an ""A"" grade for growth. This is especially noteworthy given the relative size and status of Alphabet already. Overall, the stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), and that's always a good sign heading into an earnings announcement.

Nevertheless, Alphabet currently has an Earnings ESP of -0.26%, which makes surprise prediction a bit more difficult.

Hardy tweeted Monday that he had accepted an offer to head editorial for Google Cloud, which includes G Suite and Google Cloud Platform. Google confirmed the news and said Hardy’s role was new, but declined to share further details, such as what exactly the job entails.

“Like all new undertakings, the specifics will work themselves out,” Hardy replied via Twitter direct message. He said he starts Feb. 6 and will be splitting his time between San Francisco and Mountain View.

He went on to espouse the benefits of cloud computing: “I truly believe that what cloud represents is a dramatic transformation of business, economics and much else. It will take place over years, but the nexus of sensors / mobile computing, large cloud systems and AI will remake the world on a scale of electricity, automotive power, etc. ...

The last few trades I shared on Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) were successful. This includes a win in November after I explained how to collect free dividends on GOOGL stock as we collected over 15% in yield on money risked.



Click to Enlarge Alphabet's fundamentals have not changed. I still like it for the long-term. Management continues to execute very well on the cash cow businesses. Better still: Spending on the fringe projects seems to be under control for now.

Technically, GOOGL stock was tested in late 2016 but has since recovered. Traders sold Alphabet stock and others mega-tech companies like Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) to roll into the Trump trade. Since then, the selling abated and the trade unwound.

Now, mega-tech companies are going into earnings with the winds in their sails. That includes Alphabet, which reports on Thursday, Jan. 26, after the bell.

How to Trade GOOGL Stock Now

The Trade: Buy the GOOGL Feb $835/$837.50 debit call spread for $1.20 per contract to open. This is my maximum potential risk. I stand to double my money if GOOGL stock rallies past my spread in the next few weeks.

Premiums are usually elevated ahead of earnings, and sometimes we see a move ahead of the report. If so, then I could close the spread and book partial profits early.

Usually I like to balance my trades by doing the opposite. But this time, since we are going into earnings, I will not sell any bearish risk into GOOGL earnings. Another hedge idea would be to short the PowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (ETF) (NASDAQ: QQQ ). But today, I will do neither. Instead, I will simply go long Alphabet Inc options as a lottery ticket betting on a positive reaction to their earnings.

I could further juice this trade by adding a credit put spread to collect premium and offset my out of pocket expense. However, this adds more downside risk. Personally, I prefer to wait until after the earnings report before I sell premium into GOOGL.

Still, if you'd like …

The Juice (Optional): Sell the GOOGL Mar $750/$745 credit put spread for 65 cents per contract. This trade would yield 13% if GOOGL stays above my sold spread while I am holding. This trade has a 90% theoretical chance of success with a 10% price buffer.

Earnings events add a short-term wild card to credit spreads; the short-term adverse reactions are often short-lived.

I am not required to hold any option trade open through expiration. I can close any of them at any time for partial gains or losses.

Twitter offered a suite of mobile developer offerings through Fabric, but as the company now focuses on its core product for long term growth, it is looking to sell its none-core assets and build a leaner structure. Twitter is struggling to grow users and increase user engagement. A renewed focus on its core business this year (after several talks of a possible takeover last year) is critical for the company's revival. Recently, the company allowed live streaming directly through its app by incorporating Periscope into the Twitter app. This was followed by replacing the Vine app with a pared-down version which will let users capture six second videos which can be shared directly on Twitter. We believe Twitter is looking to strengthen its core business and provide all features with its own app to attract users. While the company continues to remain committed to developers and has stated that it will continue to invest in its public APIs and publisher platform, focus on its core business is essential for long term growth of the company.

Leaner Structure, Focus On Core Business

Last year, Twitter saw plenty of interest from various players for a possible takeover. While no transaction eventually happened, Twitter now appears to be selling its non-core assets to build a leaner structure. This will ensure that the company can focus its resources on making its core product more exciting to attract users and increase user engagement. Our price estimate for Twitter is nearly 30% higher than its current market price and we expect its U.S. average monthly active users to increase from around 69 million in 2017 to nearly 83 million by the end of our forecast period.

If this growth is not achieved and the monthly active users stagnate at around 67 million (2016 number), there can be a nearly 10% downside to our price estimate.

We expect Twitter's international monthly active users to increase from 264 million in 2017 to nearly 334 million by the end of our forecast period.

There can be a 5% downside to our price estimate if this number stagnates at around 260 million over our forecast period.

Twitter is facing a challenging environment and innovative changes to its core product are critical to draw and retain users. We believe the strategy to move towards a leaner structure by selling non-core assets and focusing on developing the key product can help the company drive revenues in the long term.

For years, Netflix has been one of the biggest battleground stocks in the market, and along the way, it's attracted plenty of naysayers. Time Warner (NYSE: TWX) CEO Jeff Bewkes famously compared the streamer to ""the Albanian army"" in 2010 when asked if it posed a challenge to HBO. Wall Street analysts have regularly bashed the stock. Some have since admitted they were wrong, while others continue to throw shade at the company even after its blockbuster earnings report last night. Let's take a look at a few of the biggest myths that have circulated about Netflix in recent years and how the company just disproved them.

Image source: Netflix.

Myth No. 1. Netflix will never be profitable

Even the bears have given Netflix credit for its steady subscriber growth over the years, but the company is spreading itself too thin, spending money it doesn't have to bring in new subscribers. It's a flawed business model, and one that will never be profitable.

Reality: Indeed, Netflix has generated minimal profits since it split its streaming service from the DVD-by-mail side as the company has focused on growth before profits, Silicon Valley's mantra. But CEO Reed Hastings promised a year ago, after the company completed its international expansion, that it would generate material profits starting this year, and the company's guidance for the first quarter makes it clear that it will. Netflix is eyeing an operating margin of 9.1% in Q1, and sees domestic contribution margin, hitting 41.3%, better than the 40% goal Netflix had previously announced for 2020. It also expects to report a positive contribution margin in the international segment for the first time ever.

For the full year, management expects operating margin to moderate at 7%, but that is still up significantly from the 4% clip where it's been in recent years. Hastings also said the company incrementally increase its operating margin from there as it continues to invest in its business. That means Netflix should generate close to $1 billion in operating income and nearly $500 million in net income. In other words, it's undeniably profitable.

Myth No. 2: The international market is a boondoggle

Netflix has clearly demonstrated it can generate a profit at home, but the international market is different, detractors have argued. Accepting payment is more difficult as many people don't have international credit cards; understanding local tastes presents challenges; and Netflix is facing entrenched local competition each market.

Reality: If anything, Netflix's international growth has been remarkable. In less than seven years, the company has gained nearly 50 million paying subscribers, and added nearly 15 million last year, the first year that its service was available around the globe. Though it's racked up losses abroad, the international division is about to turn profitable as the company projected a slight contribution profit outside the U.S. this year.

Netflix also seems to be quickly mastering the international programming game as well. Its success in Brazil, which has become its second-biggest market, stands out as the company overcame initial skepticism and payment problems to become a force in Latin America's biggest country. Its sci-fi thriller 3% , released in November, was in Portuguese and set in Sao Paolo, proved to be a hit an even garnered millions of viewers in the US.

Other efforts to localize markets are paying off as well, meaning international subscriber growth should continue to be strong.

Myth No. 3: The competition will catch up

For years, the bears have been claiming that Netflix's early advantage will eventually fade as the market become saturated as big media companies and start-ups alike dive in.

Reality: Netflix is still essentially synonymous with video streaming. It will top 100 million subscribers later this year. Netflix & Chill-a euphemism for a hook-up-has become one of the most popular catchphrases among the millennial generation. The streaming service has permeated the culture in a way that none of its rivals have, and it's not for lack of trying.

Disney , Fox , and NBC formed Hulu in 2007 as an outlet to stream their TV shows, but only has about 12 million subscribers today. Tech giant Alphabet 's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) efforts to gain traction for its paid streaming service, YouTubeRed, have fallen flat. HBO, despite the launch of HBO Now, remains dependent on the traditional Pay-TV ecosystem. Only Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) has followed successfully in Netflix's footsteps with its own slate of award-winning programs, but Amazon has a much different model than Netflix. It's using video as a free giveaway to entice consumers to join its Prime service so they buy more stuff on its website. Amazon Video's viability as a stand-alone service remains questionable. The company recently launched stand-alone video globally, undercutting Netflix on price, but the move has clearly not put a dent in Netflix's own growth rate as last quarter's international subscriber growth set a new record.

Netflix has turned video entertainment into an arms race, and it has the biggest arsenal. Netflix and Amazon were the biggest spenders at the Sundance Film Festival last year, and that should be the case again as both companies have increased their content budgets. Netflix will spend $6 billion on content this year, up from $5 billion last year. Only sports giant ESPN spends more.

In the last few months alone, Netflix has formed a virtual stand-up-comedy Hall of Fame by signing Jerry Seinfeld, Amy Schumer, Chris Rock, and Dave Chappelle. The company's product is only going to get better as its momentum builds, and there's plenty of room for other streaming services as Netflix and Amazon have shown in the U.S.

With its high valuation, the stock may continue to be volatile, but the debate over the company's prospects is over. Netflix won.

It's become a substantially profitable, global media powerhouse with nearly 100 million paying subscribers, and it will continue to dominate the industry for years to come.

Does the sale indicate that Twitter will sell itself off in bits and pieces instead of as a whole company? Or does it mean that Twitter is merely streamlining its business by dumping its non-core assets? Let's take a closer look at Twitter and Google's plans to decide.

Why did Twitter sell its developer products?

Shares of Twitter currently trade well below its IPO price of $26 due to its stalled out user growth, sluggish revenue growth, and lack of GAAP profitability. Its monthly active users (MAUs) rose just 3% annually to 317 million last quarter as its revenue grew 8% to $616 million -- marking its slowest growth rate since its IPO. Its GAAP net loss only slightly narrowed from $131.7 million a year ago to $102.9 million, mainly due to high stock-based compensation expenses which gobbled up 26% of its revenues.

Faced with these challenges, Twitter announced plans to slash 9% of its workforce and wind down non-core businesses like Vine and Fabric, while focusing more on its core ""Bluebird"" Twitter app. It shuttered Vine last year, but Fabric reportedly attracted the attention of several bidders, including Microsoft and Google. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey claimed that the cuts could drive the company ""toward GAAP profitability in 2017.""

By abandoning its developer tools, Twitter can no longer establish an app ecosystem tethered to its social network and back end services. But the retreat isn't surprising, since Facebook abandoned its comparable back end as a service (BaaS) platform, Parse, last year. That failure was attributed to the fact that Parse couldn't compete against similar app development platforms from Google, Microsoft, and Amazon 's AWS. If Facebook couldn't compete, it's doubtful that Twitter could have fared much better. Investors should also have seen the writing on the wall when Twitter canceled its annual Flight developer conference last year.

Why did Google buy Twitter's tools?

Google might seem like an 800-pound gorilla in internet-related services, but its cloud infrastructure platform -- which provides development tools, analytics, and computing power for developers and companies -- is much smaller than Amazon's AWS and Microsoft's Azure. BaaS platforms play a key role in that battle, since they provide cloud-based apps with computing power while letting developers manage those apps, view usage data, and add push notifications and other features.

To compete more effectively against Amazon and Microsoft, Google acquired Firebase, a BaaS start-up, in 2014. Firebase's developer base quadrupled since that acquisition to about 450,000 users by mid-2016, and Google added additional analytics capabilities and mobile development tools. Google plans to integrate Fabric directly into Firebase, while the other tools should be gradually integrated into the platform.

Google's decision to buy Twitter's development tools instead of the whole company also indicates that the social network still isn't desirable as a single purchase. That's likely because potential suitors can't figure out how to address Twitter's slowing MAU and revenue growth and weak profitability. They also probably don't want to inherit Twitter's ongoing problems with bullies, trolls, illicit posts, and fake accounts.

Is the data licensing business next to go?

Twitter's eagerness to sell its non-core businesses raises interesting questions about its Data Licensing business, which sells ""firehose"" feeds of data to various companies. Its revenue rose 26% annually to $71 million, making it Twitter's fastest growing business unit.

But it's also been blamed for spreading fake news and causing stock market ""flash crashes"" by rapidly sending bot-generated tweets to news organizations and high-speed trading firms. I previously speculated that Twitter was unwilling to purge its network of bots because they counted as MAUs and they fed the licensing unit's firehose feeds. If Twitter sells or spins off its data licensing business, it would generate some fresh cash and let it purge some bots and fake accounts to improve the quality of its social network.

The bottom line

Twitter's sale of its developer tools to Google isn't a game changer for either company. But it reveals how aggressively Twitter is streamlining its business around its Bluebird app, and indicates that Google might need more acquisitions to keep up with Amazon and Microsoft in the cloud platform race. Therefore, investors should see if Twitter unloads any more non-core businesses in the near future.

The analyst expects gross revenue of $24.40 billion, net revenue of $19.78 billion, non-GAAP operating income of $7.66 billion, and non-GAAP EPS of $9.27. His gross and net revenue estimates are a bit below consensus (at $25.30B and $20.58B, respectively), as is his non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP EPS estimates (at $8.25B and $9.62, respectively).

Mahaney noted, “Based on intra-quarter data points and our model sensitivity analysis, we believe Street estimates for Q4 are slightly aggressive on the top-line and on the bottom-line. We note that Google does hedge its FX exposure, tho the magnitude of recent currency moves has been unusual.”

In closing, Mahaney reiterates an Outperform rating on shares of Alphabet, with a price target of $1025, which represents a potential upside of 22% from where the stock is currently trading.

As usual, we like to include the analyst’s trackrecord when reporting on new analyst notes. According to TipRanks.com, which measures analysts’ and bloggers’ success rate based on how their calls perform, analyst Mark Mahaney has a yearly average return of 21.4% and a 71% success rate. Mahaney has a 15.5% average return when recommending GOOGL, and is ranked #2 out of 4361 analysts.

Out of the 26 analysts polled in the past 3 months, 25 rate Alphabet stock a Buy, while only 1 rates the stock a Hold. With a return potential of 14%, the stock’s consensus target price stands at $961.61.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This includes a win in November after I explained how to collect free dividends on GOOGL stock as we collected over 15% in yield on money risked.



Click to Enlarge Alphabet’s fundamentals have not changed. I still like it for the long-term. Management continues to execute very well on the cash cow businesses. Better still: Spending on the fringe projects seems to be under control for now.

Technically, GOOGL stock was tested in late 2016 but has since recovered. Traders sold Alphabet stock and others mega-tech companies like Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) to roll into the Trump trade. Since then, the selling abated and the trade unwound.

Now, mega-tech companies are going into earnings with the winds in their sails. That includes Alphabet, which reports on Thursday, Jan. 26, after the bell.

How to Trade GOOGL Stock Now

The Trade: Buy the GOOGL Feb $835/$837.50 debit call spread for $1.20 per contract to open. This is my maximum potential risk. I stand to double my money if GOOGL stock rallies past my spread in the next few weeks.

Premiums are usually elevated ahead of earnings, and sometimes we see a move ahead of the report. If so, then I could close the spread and book partial profits early.

Usually I like to balance my trades by doing the opposite. But this time, since we are going into earnings, I will not sell any bearish risk into GOOGL earnings. Another hedge idea would be to short the PowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (ETF) (NASDAQ: QQQ ). But today, I will do neither. Instead, I will simply go long Alphabet Inc options as a lottery ticket betting on a positive reaction to their earnings.

I could further juice this trade by adding a credit put spread to collect premium and offset my out of pocket expense. However, this adds more downside risk. Personally, I prefer to wait until after the earnings report before I sell premium into GOOGL.

Still, if you’d like …

The Juice (Optional): Sell the GOOGL Mar $750/$745 credit put spread for 65 cents per contract. This trade would yield 13% if GOOGL stays above my sold spread while I am holding. This trade has a 90% theoretical chance of success with a 10% price buffer.

Earnings events add a short-term wild card to credit spreads; the short-term adverse reactions are often short-lived.

I am not required to hold any option trade open through expiration. I can close any of them at any time for partial gains or losses.

Google is going to let advertisers target YouTube ads based on people's search histories, giving brands a whole new perspective into the consumer mindset.

On Friday, Google announced updates to its YouTube offering for advertisers, including a promise of new measurement tools to help marketers understand their campaigns. But it was the introduction of search data into the targeting of YouTube video spots that most intrigued advertisers.

Brands could start to consider pushing video ads to YouTube viewers who recently searched for a retail product, travel destination or movie show time.

""There has been targeting on YouTube based on what videos people watch there,"" said one top advertising exec, speaking on condition of anonymity because of a close relationship with Google. ""Now, for anyone logged in, their search history can be applied to targeting on YouTube. There's some interesting possibilities there, and it greatly expands the audience advertisers could reach.""

Google's search data is considered among the most powerful information for guiding advertising, but Google has kept it under tight wraps, careful when applying it toward ads outside the search experience.

Google faces extra scrutiny from regulators and privacy advocates when it comes to collecting consumer data and applying it to its ad products.

For years, the company kept a wall between search and other ad products, but increased competition from Facebook has made that commitment impractical.

Google declined to comment for this story, but did post a blog statement on Friday.

Google users can turn off ads personalization in their settings.

""As more viewership on YouTube shifts to mobile, we're making it easier for advertisers to deliver more relevant, useful ads across screens,"" Diya Jolly, YouTube's director of product management, said in the blog post. ""Now, information from activity associated with users' Google accounts (such as demographic information and past searches) may be used to influence the ads those users see on YouTube.""

Ms. Jolly described how someone searching for a winter coat could then see an ad in YouTube from a retailer.

Google said that more than 50% of YouTube video is viewed on mobile devices.

Google also revealed that it was working on a ""cloud-based measurement solution"" over the next year, to give advertisers more information into how their campaigns perform but balancing that with consumer privacy.

The measurement development appears to be a nod to the advertising uproar over the past few months, in which brands have begun to question the accuracy of the numbers coming out of the platforms like YouTube and Facebook.

""With this new solution, advertisers will have access to more detailed insights from their YouTube campaigns across devices, so they can better understand the impact of their campaigns on their highest-value customers,"" Ms. Jolly's blog post said. ""For instance, a car manufacturer could get a rich understanding of how YouTube ads across devices influenced a specific audience (like previous SUV buyers).""

Concerns about so-called ""fake news"" won't derail the real profits social media giant Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) will generate in 2017 and beyond. And this makes FB stock one to bet on before the company's earnings are released later this month. Combined with accelerating ad-revenue growth, the company's $6 billion buyback and its mobile assets, Facebook stock should reach $150 in the next 12 to 18 months.

Source: Shutterstock

Aside from fake news , the emergence and popularity of Snapchat has scared off some FB investors as seen with the near-3% decline Facebook stock suffered at the end of 2016.

Still, with fast-growing assets, such as Instagram and Messenger, which will help drive growth in the quarters ahead, the Menlo Park, California-based company continues to be a dominant force in the realm of advertising.

Facebook Stock Is Still Standing Strong

What's more, FB has perfected mobile, which gives it a distinct advantage over Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR ) and even Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ). For this reason, Facebook is expected reach $30 billion in mobile ad revenue and $38 billion in 2018, according to research firm eMarketer. The firm also indicates that mobile advertising comprises roughly 50% of the digital spending in the U.S. As such, FB stock should make up a bigger share of your portfolio.

Notably, while Facebook did spook investors when it warned about higher capital expenses in 2017, this came on the back of strong third-quarter results. In this quarter, it reached $6.8 billion in advertising revenue (a 59% increase year-over-year).

In other words, FB's ad revenue is accelerating, not declining as investors feared. And this makes it tough to bet against Facebook stock or doubt any investment the company makes to enhance the platform.

Likewise, even assuming Facebook does suffer decelerating ad growth, the company should be able to offset that weakness with a combination of higher user growth, time spent, live video, video ads, better ad targeting and higher revenues from Instagram and Messenger. Plus, we haven't even mentioned the growth possibilities with the Oculus VR/AR headset.

Bottom Line for FB Stock

FB stock is currently trading around $127, down about 5% from its 52-week high of $133.50. The company will report fourth quarter and full-year 2016 earnings at the end of this month. For the quarter that ended December, Wall Street expects $1.30 in earnings per share on revenue of $8.49 billion, translating to year-over-year growth of 64% and 45%, respectively. Fiscal 2017 estimates calls for $5.18 per share, which prices Facebook stock at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 22.

While that P/E is still four points above the S&P 500 Index , it calls for year-over-year earnings-per-share growth of almost 30%. That rate of growth deserves a higher multiple of around 28, which puts FB stock right around $150 per share. Good luck finding another tech stock with Facebook's market cap that can deliver this combination of growth and value.

Donald Trump has been sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. The President-elect, who pledged to “Make America great again,” promised plenty of things he would do regarding his first day in office. From repealing and replacing Obamacare to renegotiating NAFTA and beginning the construction of the wall on the Mexican border.

We won’t know for certain which of Trump’s policies will take priority or how they will be enforced. But what we do know is that for Trump to make good on his promises to bring back jobs, grow GDP and strengthen industry, he needs businesses to lead, innovate and hire workers. For that to happen, businesses leaders need to know their government is on their side. To that end, here are some names to own for the next four years (at least) as Trump’s policies take shape.

Lower Corporate Taxes

Trump’s promise to lower corporate taxes can have a boosting effect on the tech sector, which has an estimated $1.4 trillion stashed in overseas tax havens. These include some America's largest corporations such as Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), which could face a huge tax hit if they bring that cash home. Not only has Trump promised to lower the business tax rate from 35% to 15%, he pledged to eliminate the corporate alternative minimum tax.

Beyond lowering the tax rate, it would hardly shock anyone if Trump — given his pro-business stance — were to enact a tax holiday at some point during his presidency. Companies like Cisco (CSCO), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL) would thrive. They would no longer need to borrow cheap cash to fund their operations. Likewise, a better capitalized Tesla (TSLA) can accelerate the building of its Gigafactory, helping it achieve not only higher profit margins, but also higher vehicle production. In the process, Tesla would ignite the state of Nevada as an innovative hub, while mass-producing producing emission-free vehicles at affordable prices.

“Repeal and Replace”

The Affordable Care Act, a.k.a Obamacare was designed to — among other things — “insure the un-insurable.” Notably, to provide insurance coverage to people with pre-existing conditions who were blocked under the then-existing rules. Depending on what side of the aisle you’re on, Obamacare either did its job or was a “complete disaster,” according to Trump. Still, whether Obamacare is entirely dismantled or parts of it is kept, you don’t have to look too far beyond UnitedHealth (UNH) to find a stock can will thrive.

UnitedHealth has worked aggressively to exit the Affordable Care exchanges, which reduces its exposure to any changes Trump might make. What’s more, added from being the nation's largest health insurer, UnitedHealth owns Optum, which provides pharmacy benefit management services. Last week, not only did the company beat top- and bottom-line estimates, UnitedHealth raised its fiscal 2017 financial outlook, suggesting it is ready for whatever Trump decides to do.

Not every company will be as lucky. Conversely, companies such HCA Holdings (HCA) and Universal Health Services (UHS) that prospered under Obamacare may suffer. As will government health care providers such as Centene Corporation (CNC) and Molina Healthcare, Inc. (MOH).

Scale Back Dodd-Frank

Cutting down strict regulations imposed on financial institutions has been another policy Trump has proposed. After all, how can he achieve economic growth and strengthen small business if banks aren't lending money — something banks collectively struggled to do under Dodd-Frank. But as evidenced by the strong earnings results released so far from the likes of Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS), financials are once again the sector to bank on.

Written to strengthen consumer protection and create tougher rules on excessive risk-taking, the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act has been cited by bank executives as a prohibiter of growth. ""There's many aspects of it that we've got to kill,"" said Steven Mnuchin, Trump's pick for Treasury secretary. Mnuchin former partner at Goldman Sachs, called Dodd-Frank ""the number one priority on the regulatory side.”

To that end, I would be surprised if Trump doesn’t take to “repeal and replace” Dodd-Frank in his first 100 days in office. Combined with the prospect of higher interest rates, lower taxes it’s tough to ignore the potential upside a bank like Morgan Stanley (MS) can provide. It’s not just the big banks that will prosper, however. Keep an eye on super regionals like Comerica (CMA), US Bancorp (USB) and PNC Financial (PNC), which Trump has made great again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Though they don't compete head-to-head (for now), social networking dynamo Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) and e-commerce leader Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) are two of the most successful companies in tech today. Now, as their market capitalizations each sit near $400 billion, Facebook and Amazon shares have once again shown that their days as growth companies remain far from over.

For all their successes, though, it isn't immediately clear whether Amazon or Facebook is the better buy today. In this article, we will put Amazon and Facebook shares through a 3-part investing gauntlet to determine which company is the more compelling stock.

1. Financial fortitude

The differences in Amazon and Facebook's business models manifest themselves here. In comparing the two, Facebook simply trounces Amazon in all but one liquidity measurement.

Company Cash & Investments Debt Cash From Operations Current Ratio Amazon $18.3 billion $8.2 billion $14.6 billion 1.0x Facebook $26.1 billion $0 billion $12.5 billion 11.6x

Data Source: Amazon investor relations, Facebook investor relations, Yahoo! Finance

Like Alphabet , Facebook's lucrative advertising platform provides it with plenty of excess cash, largely negating the need for the company to take on debt to fund its operations. On the other hand, the fixed asset nature of Amazon's e-commerce business requires the company to employ a responsible amount of leverage in its capital structure. Speaking to their different margin structures, Amazon's revenue base is roughly four-time as large as Facebook's. So though Amazon's financial footing is indeed sound, Facebook easily wins the comparison of financial fortitude.

Winner: Facebook

2. Durable competitive advantages

As the leaders in their respective markets, it's fair to say that both Facebook and Amazon.com each enjoy durable competitive advantages, albeit of very different sorts. Amazon derives its competitive moat from two distinct sources. First, Amazon's leadership position in e-commerce gives the company meaningful leverage over its suppliers -- remember its heated dispute with book publishers like Hachette? -- which translates into lower prices. Second, Amazon's uniquely entrepreneurial culture -- Jeff Bezos describes it as ""the best place in the world to fail' -- allows it to constantly reinvent and improve its business model. It's this kind of thinking that allowed Amazon to create AWS, and it's this same spirit that could see Amazon disrupt the global logistics business as well. Amazon's uncanny ability to find ways to lower its own cost structure, and thus the prices it charges becomes a self-fulfilling growth driver that Amazon refers to as its Flywheel Effect .

Facebook also enjoys several important competitive advantages. As easily the world's largest social network, Facebook's massive size and scale make it one of the most important companies in tech and one of the most difficult to disrupt. With 1.79 billion monthly active users as of its most recent earnings, Facebook's ability to reach nearly any demographic at scale makes it impossible for marketers to ignore. This network effect also extends to its user base as well; the nature of its network effects mean Facebook's network becomes more valuable as more users join. Lastly, machine learning and artificial intelligence software need massive data sets to power their learning processes, and few companies possess as large an interconnected trove of personal data as Facebook.

Winner: Tie

3. Valuation

From a purely numerical standpoint, Facebook easily wins the valuation showdown against Amazon. Here's a quick snapshot of how several of the most popular valuation metrics break down between these two tech giants.

Company P/E Forward P/E EV/EBITDA Amazon 182.4 89.8 34.5 Facebook 59.6 24.1 25.6

Data Source: Amazon investor relations, Facebook investor relations, Yahoo! Finance

Amazon generates far more cash than its accounting income suggests, which explains the chasm-like disparity between the e-commerce giant's earnings and EBITDA multiples. Digging into its cash flow statement, Amazon generated an impressive $14.6 billion in cash from its operations -- nearly half of which is eaten by non-cash depreciation charges alone -- over its past 12 months, versus $2.1 billion in GAAP profits. This reflects the company's longstanding strategy to reinvest its earnings as aggressively as possible to fuel its long-term growth, which it has done by rapidly growing its fulfillment network over the past decade.

Though it uses some long-lived assets like data centers similarly, Facebook's overall business model is far less fixed-asset intensive, which translates into far larger gross margins and higher profit margins for Facebook. As was the case with their balance sheet examinations in this article's first section, the differences in their business models makes comparing the differences in Facebook's and Amazon's valuations an apple-to-oranges exercise. However, at the end of the day, Facebook's greater profits and lower multiples earn it a win in this category.

Winner: Facebook (slightly)

And the winner is... Facebook

Winning two of the three categories, Facebook earns the title of better buy here. However, more importantly, both Facebook and Amazon are both great stocks to own for long-term tech investors. As the clear leaders in their respective markets, each driven by its own visionary leadership, Amazon and Facebook are indeed both fantastic stocks to buy today.

1/20/2017,0.377598358,0.045342182,806.91,806.91,801.69,805.02,1670045,5.22,-1.89,0,"Alibaba ( BABA ) is scheduled to announce its fiscal Q3 2017 earnings on January 24. The company reported 40-50% growth in revenues in each of the first three quarters of 2016, with significant growth coming from its cloud computing and Digital Media businesses. In the most recent quarter, Digital Media and entertainment, which includes revenues from online video streaming Youku Tudou and mobile Internet services revenue from UCWeb, were up by over 300% to RMB 3.6 billion. This was primarily attributable to the Youku Tudou acquisition, which was completed in the first half of the year. Additionally, cloud computing and other ventures revenues were up by a massive 110% to RMB 2.2 billion.

On the other hand, Alibaba's core commerce businesses has continued to post strong revenue growth over the last few years. This trend continued through 2016 with over 40% revenue growth in combined core commerce revenue streams. Growth in Alibaba's international e-commerce business was further boosted by the $1 billion acquisition of the Singaporean e-commerce giant Lazada in April last year.

Alibaba's largest division is the online retail business in China, which includes websites Taobao, Tmall and Juhuasuan. This segment has provided consistent growth for the company over the last few years, with revenues growing from RMB 24 billion in 2012 to RMB 75 billion in 2015. The growth spree has continued in 2016, with revenues growing by 35-40% through the March, June and September quarters.

For the full year we forecast Alibaba's China retail revenues to grow by 32% to just under RMB 100 billion, driven by a corresponding increase in the total gross merchandise volume (GMV) handled by Alibaba. Alibaba's China domestic GMV could increase by over 25% to RMB 3.7 trillion for the full year. GMV for Alibaba is calculated as the multiplier of total number of buyers (or monthly active users) and the average spend per buyer. Alibaba has witnessed strong growth in monthly active users, especially in lower-tier cities across China due to the growing smartphone and internet penetration in these regions. As a result, the number of buyers is expected to continue to increase over the next few years.

Comparatively, we forecast Alibaba's cloud computing and other revenues combined to grow at almost 100% year-over-year to RMB 16.1 billion. As mentioned earlier, much of the growth in Digital Media is attributable to the acquisition of Youku Tudou. Additionally, cloud computing revenues have grown as a result of an increase in the number of paying customers. The total number of paying customers in the June quarter more than doubled over the previous year quarter to 651,000.

We forecast the company's adjusted EBITDA to grow at 27% through 2016, which is actually a slightly slower rate than its forecast revenue growth. The resulting EBITDA margin could compress by almost 4 percentage points to around 48%. This is mainly due to the fact that Alibaba is currently operating at a loss on all its non-commerce divisions. Alibaba is investing heavily on developing platforms for cloud computing, acquiring traffic for the online video and music segments, and investing in content and production with a longer term view. As a result, Alibaba's operating profit margin has declined on a year-over-year basis in each of the previous two years as the company has acquired new businesses and invested in developing newer platforms. This trend could continue over the next couple of years since the near-term pressure on EBITDA margins is expected to sustain due to increased investments. However, the company has a marketplaces model and has a huge potential to scale up its cloud offerings. This could help the company maintain relatively low variable costs in the long run, which would imply that its operating leverage will remain high in the long run.

As return results for 2016 roll in, several prominent funds have reported market-beating gains, but data from Hedge Fund Research Institute on Tuesday confirms that funds categorized as ""value"" beat those focused on ""growth"" on 12-month, three-year and four-year annual bases.

In the category of equity hedge funds, the HFRX EH: Fundamental Value Index returned 0.85% in December, 3.64% in the past 12 months, 0.42% in the past three years and 4.12% in the past four years. The HFRX EH: Fundamental Growth Index declined 1.12%, 6.55%, 1.88% and 0.4% for the same periods.

The Fundamental Value Index also exceeded the general HFRX Global Hedge Fund Index in all periods except for December. It returned 0.86% for the month, 2.50% in the past 12 months, lost 0.6% in the past three years and gained 2.46% in the past four years.

A screen shows that the hedge funds tracked by GuruFocus have the greatest consensus on Alphabet ( GOOG ), Alphabet ( GOOGL ) Bank of America ( BAC ), Apple ( AAPL ) and Facebook ( FB ), whose value status would be arguable by different managers. Each of the stocks appreciated by double digits over the past year.

The gains come against a 20.5% rise in the S&P 500, though, that extended the five-year market rally of 72%.

Despite reports of clients fleeing hedge funds due to lackluster returns, HFR released another study Friday saying that total assets under management in the industry rose above $3 trillion for the first time. Total capital increased by $46.8 billion in the fourth quarter, to $3.02 billion at the end of the year. It was the second consecutive quarter of record assets for hedge funds.

The industry still faces investor withdrawals, as clients pulled $71.1 billion, or 2.4% of assets, from the industry in 2016, the second largest outflow since 2009, when they took back $131 billion. Client redemptions totaled $18.7 billion in the fourth quarter, or 0.63% of industry assets, compared to an outflow of $28.2 billion in the third quarter, the report said.

In the largest strategy in the industry, equity hedge, capital ballooned to $7.5 billion in the fourth quarter and $20 billion for the year, for a record of $849 billion. The index tracking the strategy also increased by 5.5% compared to the previous year, driven by energy/basic materials and fundamental value funds.

But the category also saw the fundamental value portion lead outflows, with $17 billion gone, followed by fundamental growth strategies, which lost $11 billion, as the total declined $6 billion. Investors redirected to other strategies within equity hedge funds, with quantitative directional seeing $4.7 billion and equity market neutral $3.9 billion in inflows.

The circular Android Wear 2.0 watch will reportedly go on sale immediately after the announcement. Watch specs include a larger “flagship” model with a higher-capacity battery, more RAM, GPS, NFC (near-field communication) for Android Pay, heart rate sensor, and cellular connectivity (3G/LTE) built in.

That latter feature would be an important distinction from the Apple Watch Series 2, which relies on the iPhone for cellular connectivity. Watches with cellular connectivity, like the LG Watch Urbane 2nd Edition and Samsung Gear S3 frontier model, allow you to get email and texts without being tethered to a phone.

LG’s Watch Urbane 2nd Edition -- which has classic wristwatch styling -- has been available from Verizon and AT&T since last year. Verizon’s ad copy states that you can text or call from your watch using your current smartphone number.

But if they're bidding against Google itself, that’s a conflict of interest. Google has a pretty clear incentive to bump up ads for its own products — despite its competitors bids for the same space — to the top of the search page.

According to a data analysis in the Wall Street Journal, the search giant has been buying millions of its own ads and displaying its products such as Google Home and Nest thermostats atop search results, over those of ad-buying customers.

Analysis of 25,000 searches of selected terms found that 91 percent of the time, Google and Alphabet products took the top spot. Here are some specifics:

Searches for “phones” almost always led with ads for Google Pixel.

Searches for “laptops” all started with ads for the Chromebook.

Ninety-eight percent of searches for “watches” were topped with Android smartwatch ads.

It’s a convincing analysis, but then the Journal also goes on to point out that Google takes measures to prevent its use of its own ad space from driving up costs for customers:

Google said that when it competes for ads, other advertisers are charged as if it wasn’t bidding, meaning its participation doesn’t directly inflate prices ... Google said that its ads only appear atop results because of the ad’s quality and the price Google is willing to pay. Google said its house ads are also subject to marketing budgets.

“We have consciously and carefully designed our marketing programs to not impact the ad auction. All our bids are excluded from the auction when determining the price paid by other advertisers, and we have strict rules and processes — set to tougher levels than our customers — to govern the use of our own ads products,” Google said in response to the Journal story.

A 2010 blog post on Google’s AdWords blog said it “probably comes as no surprise that we are huge fans of AdWords,” adding that “house ads are a common industry practice.”

You have to take Google at their word on self-imposed restrictions. And while taking out house ads is a common practice generally — newspapers and TV stations do it, too — when you’re the gateway to the internet, that practice can come at a cost for customers in a different way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among other challenges that Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) faced last year, particularly in the final months, the social network conceded that some of its analytics and engagement metrics had been miscalculated. The company owned up to these errors no less than three times in 2016 -- in September , November, and December.

These metrics are absolutely critical to advertisers, who operate their own business and make ad spending decisions based on how well ads perform across platforms, including social media. We're talking about a wide range of metrics that measure everything from time spent in Instant Articles to app or site referrals to video completions to organic reach, among many others. As you might expect, the admissions don't instill a lot of confidence in advertisers looking to spend ad dollars on Facebook.

Get a second opinion

Facebook has said it will invest more heavily in additional third-party verifications (working with prominent analytics and measurement companies like comScore and Nielsen , among others) in an effort to validate the metrics that it provides to advertiser partners. But that isn't stopping advertisers from taking matters into their own hands.

Advertiser Perceptions released the results of a survey earlier this week that suggests 40% of advertisers are planning on conducting independent audits of Facebook's metrics around audience reach and ad delivery, according to Ad Age . It's possible that not all of these advertisers will actually perform the audits, but such a high level of distrust is disconcerting. Advertiser Perceptions Chief Strategy Officer Kevin Mannion told Ad Age that ad platforms need to get ahead of these issues and rebuild trust with advertisers, and the most effective way to do that is to expand third-party verifications.

To the point, half of advertisers are averse to buying ads on platforms that are deemed risky, like social media. Confidence in social media advertising is well below 50%, while there's much more confidence in the more mature area of search advertising, which is naturally dominated by Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) . There's also a disconnect with where advertisers plan on increasing their spending this year; just 8% plan on spending more on Facebook's platform while maintaining the same budget with Google, while 36% are planning to spend more on Google's platform and leaving Facebook spending unchanged.

This all comes as investors fret over whether or not Facebook can hit consensus estimates for 2017, which call for roughly 35% revenue growth. The company does have many levers it can pull to grow the top line -- like ad price increases or increased engagement -- and in November the company said it ad load would be less of a contributing factor than in prior years. But it's pretty hard to increase prices if advertiser confidence is low, and investing more in third-party verifications could dent profits. Facebook has little choice, though; it needs to reinstill its customers' confidence.

Stop me if you've heard this one before: Major tech giant designs and launches new flagship phone but is unable to fulfill demand due to severe supply constraints and inventory shortages.

That may often be the case for a certain Cupertino company, but this time around we're talking about Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary Google. The company's new Pixel phones, which are the first that were completely designed in-house, continue to suffer from inventory shortages. Prospective customers are having an incredibly difficult time actually getting their hands on the device, and it's not just a function of limited distribution since Google only has one exclusive carrier partner, Verizon (NYSE: VZ) .

Survey says

Wave7 Research released some estimates just a few days ago (via FierceWireless ), after conducting surveys at roughly 50 carrier retail stores. The researcher's data shows that the Pixel represented nearly 10% of all smartphone sales at Verizon in December. That's up from the 8% that the Pixel grabbed in November that Wave7 estimated in a separate report.

While Verizon remains the exclusive carrier partner that is authorized to sell and distribute the Pixel, it's still faring well at other carriers in terms of activations. Customers have to buy the device somewhere else, but can bring the device to other networks. We already know that T-Mobile is setting up Pixel displays at its retail locations, even if the Un-carrier isn't able to sell the device until Verizon's exclusivity runs its course.

As far as problems go, it could be worse

The Verge also notes that according to third-party online inventory trackers, some models have been out of stock at Google's online store since Nov. 30, which was nearly two months ago. The shortages appear to be concentrated on both the larger XL models, as well as those with 128 GB of storage -- that is, the most expensive variants. A Google spokesperson told The Verge:

We're aware about the inventory issues on the Google Store and Verizon. Honestly, demand has exceeded our expectations. We're doing our best to restock on an ongoing basis.

Of course, in the grand scheme of problems to have, demand vastly outstripping supply is as good as it gets. But it is a problem though, especially since most Android users aren't especially loyal to specific brands. The big risk is that a prospective Pixel buyer is unwilling to endure the wait and simply goes with another flagship Android device, of which there are many solid contenders.

The shortages are a bit peculiar since Google tapped HTC to effectively serve as a contract manufacturer. While HTC has fallen far in the global smartphone market in terms of unit volumes and prominence, the Taiwanese company still has considerable experience shipping high volumes of handsets. Both Google and HTC likely underestimated demand and may need to shift production capacity away from other devices and make more Pixels.

How much of an impact Pixel will have on Google's financials remains unclear, as the company has never disclosed granular unit volumes for hardware products, including Nexus devices. For better or for worse, the situation reinforces why I don't believe Google intends to make Pixel a high-volume product .

Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Brin said that when he was in charge of Alphabet's research group he didn't pay much attention to a team working on artificial intelligence. Now the technology, operated by a division of the company called Google Brain, touches nearly every piece of its business, including translation, photography and advertising.

""This revolution,"" Brin said, ""has been very profound and definitely surprised me even though I was right in there and could throw paper clips at them.""

Business leaders, politicians, economists and others attending the annual Davos retreat in the Swiss mountains have been debating the political and economic fallout from the globalization policies that conference attendees have long advocated. Advances in artificial intelligence and automation are ushering in changes to industries ranging from manufacturing to law, threatening to eliminate many jobs. Brin said technology's evolution is ""inherently chaotic"" and changes require debate about the proper ways for society to adjust.

""These are deep and powerful philosophical questions but I don't know that we're equipped to answer them,"" said Brin, adding that education should be more easily available.

Expressing optimism, Brin said automation may allow people to take up more intellectually demanding, creative or artistic pursuits. ""Some of the more mundane tasks are alleviated through technology and people will find more and more creative and meaningful ways to spend their time,"" he said.

Still, he cautioned that the future is impossible to predict. ""It's an incredible time and it's very hard to forecast what can these things do,"" he said. ""We don't really know the limits.""

Brin, who co-founded Google with Stanford classmate Larry Page in 1998, said it was his first trip to Davos in eight years. Observing the soul-searching among those attending about globalization's impact on people's lives, Brin joked that it reminded him of another event he's attended.

Though top analyst Colin Sebastian sees this as a sensible move on the social media giant’s part considering its recent transition towards core services and platforms, he remains sidelined on the bigger picture.

As such, the analyst reiterates a Neutral rating on shares of TWTR with a $17 price target, which aligns with current levels.

Sebastian notes, “Twitter is kicking off the new year with greater focus on the core application and supporting features, such as investing in ad products (including MoPub) and in the ramping of additional streaming partnerships in an effort to fuel new user growth and strengthen advertiser engagement. Given sluggish user and revenue trends, and what appears to be limited interest from potential acquirers at current enterprise value, we can understand management’s increased emphasis in these areas.”

Ultimately, “Fabric’s development tools, including the top-rated Crashlytics and Answers app stability kits, grew to reach nearly 2.5 billion active mobile devices in two years. Despite the early success of Fabric, we believe Twitter’s decision to divest makes sense as part of a broader strategic move toward the company’s core services,” Sebastian concludes.

Colin Sebastian has a very good TipRanks score with a 74% success rate and a high ranking of #18 out 4,350 analysts. Sebastian garners 17.0% in his yearly returns. When recommending TWTR, Sebastian earns 0.0% in average profits on the stock.

TipRanks analytics exhibit TWTR as a Hold. Out of 21 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 3 are bullish on Twitter stock, 13 remain sidelined, and 5 are bearish on the stock. With a loss potential of 3%, the stock’s consensus target price stands at $16.57.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1/18/2017,0.420249597,0.080035866,805.81,806.2,800.99,806.07,1294407,5.21,0.26,1,"Google is taking over Twitter’s mobile app developer platform Fabric, as well as its Crashlytics crash reporting system, Answers mobile app analytics, Digits SMS login system and FastLane development automation system. Twitter launched Fabric as a modular SDK in 2014 to allow developers to pick and choose different tools to improve their apps, and it now serves apps reaching 2.5 billion users built by 580,000 developers.

But as Twitter tries to get into better financial shape, it’s cutting non-essential divisions. By passing the platform off to Google, it can remove the costs of running Fabric without screwing over its developers by suddenly shutting it down. Google will continue to operate Fabric and its related tools, and developers shouldn’t have to do anything to support the transition.

It begs the question, is Twitter trying to slim down to take another swing at getting acquired?

Thinner Twitter

After acquisition talks last year failed, Twitter must become self-sustaining. Basically, if it doesn’t make enough money, it’s getting the axe. That’s why Vine got shut down yesterday and relaunched as Vine Camera, which no longer hosts videos because that can get expensive. Now it’s Fabric’s turn, as Twitter apparently sees enterprise developer tool sales as an unlucrative detour from its core ad and data business.

Twitter tells me it will continue to run and invest in its other developer-facing products, such as its Publisher platform, Twitter Kit, Gnip, TweetDeck, MoPub, plus its Public APIs and Ads APIs because they are tied directly to its core business and align with its priorities for 2017.

The Fabric team announced “Today we enter the next chapter for Fabric and are pleased to announce that we’ve signed an agreement for Fabric to be acquired by Google and for our team to join Google’s Developer Products Group, working with the Firebase team.” Google’s Firebase product manager Francis Ma writes, “Our missions align closely: help developers build better apps and grow their business.”

Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed, and Twitter refused to provide more detail upon request. Google told TechCrunch that all Fabric team members will be coming aboard. Digits shall remain under Twitter’s control during the transition period.

Crashlytics will become Firebase’s main crash reporting tool. Founded in 2011, Twitter acquired Crashlytics in 2013 for $38.2 million in common stock plus stock options that reportedly made the deal worth over $100 million. [Correction: We originally didn’t mention the stock options that boost the value of the Crashlytics deal.] After six years, co-founder Jeff Seibert will be stepping back from Crashlytics, which will now be led by Twitter’s VP of engineering, Rich Paret.

Though Twitter itself isn’t allowed in China, Crashlytics counted internet giants like Alibaba and Baidu as users. Twitter still sells advertising space to Chinese companies, but it has now sold its biggest bridge to the country.

While Twitter initially charged for enterprise access to tools like Crashlytics and Answers, it later made them free. The strategy seemed to be that if more developers were part of the Twitter ecosystem, they’d build apps that piggyback on the microblogging service and provide it with extra functionality and platform lock-in.

But that strategy may have proved too indirect for Twitter as it tries to cut losses, which were $103 million in Q3 2016. Facebook similarly shut down its Parse mobile development platform last year, and its founder Ilya Sukhar today tweeted that he was jealous that it didn’t get sold to Google like Fabric.

Kudos to the folks responsible here. This isn't easy. And I'm jelly. https://t.co/YeGSjr8CXv — Ilya Sukhar (@ilyasu) January 18, 2017

Will more Twitter divisions get cut, sold off, or rolled in? Periscope, for example, could sensibly become Twitter Live, since Twitter finally just added the ability to broadcast straight from its own app. If the dedicated livestream discovery and consumption features of Periscope’s own app don’t pull their weight, it might make sense to shrink the team and make the product entirely part of Twitter’s app.

If Twitter can reduce its headcount, ditch superflous divisions, and reinforce its core product and business, it might have another shot at selling to someone with the resources to make it a financial success.

Devs trust Google, not Twitter

Google, on the other hand, is deeply focused on turning mobile app developers into paid customers by upselling them from free dev tools to paid tiers. It acquired LaunchKit in July to give devs easier ways to create App Store screenshots and websites for their mobile apps.

Having watched Amazon’s success with AWS, Google sees opportunities in selling its robust backend infrastructure to developers who don’t want to build every piece of an app’s architecture themselves.

This won’t be the first time Twitter developers feel like it pulled a fast one on it. In the 2008-2012 era, when Twitter desperately needed help getting off the ground and establishing hardcore usage, it offered APIs for developers to build their own Twitter clients.

But at the end of 2012, as it sought to ramp up its advertising business in its own clients’ apps, it suddenly restricted API access, essentially murdering several tools that developers had spent years building to Twitter’s benefit. Then Twitter did the same to its firehose data resellers like DataSift, cutting them off in favor of charging for access to the Gnip service it acquired.

Jack Dorsey later apologized for Twitter thrashing developers this way, but after pulling the rug out from under them, the lack of trust in the community hampered Fabric’s success. Now with it pawning off Fabric to Google, it’s hard to imagine developers putting much faith in Twitter going forward.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The scheme, which has been gaining popularity in the past few months and has reportedly been hitting other email services, involves a clever trick that can be difficult to detect.

Researchers at WordFence, a team that makes a popular security tool for the blog site WordPress, warned of the attack in a recent blog post, noting that it has been ""having a wide impact, even on experienced technical users."" (See these people, whose accounts were targeted .)

Here's how the swindle works. The attacker, usually disguised as a trusted contact, sends a boobytrapped email to a prospective victim. Affixed to that email, there appears to be a regular attachment, say a PDF document. Nothing seemingly out of the ordinary.

Get Data Sheet , Fortune ’s technology newsletter.

But the attachment is actually an embedded image that has been crafted to look like a PDF. Rather than reveal a preview of the document when clicked, that embedded image links out to a fake Google ( googl ) login page. And this is where the scam gets really devious.

Everything about this sign-in page looks authentic: the Google logo, the username and password entry fields, the tagline (""One account. All of Google.""). By all indications, the page is a facsimile of the real thing. Except for one clue: the browser's address bar.

Screenshot of Google login page

Even there, it can be easy to miss the cue. The text still includes the ""https://accounts.google.com,"" a URL that seems legitimate. There's a problem though; that URL is preceded by the prefix ""data:text/html.""

Via WordFence

In fact, the text in the address bar is what's known as a ""data URI,"" not a URL. A data URI embeds a file, whereas a URL identifies a page's location on the web. If you were were to zoom out on the address bar, you would find a long string of characters, a script that serves up a file designed to look like a Gmail login page. This is the trap.

As soon as a person enters her username and password into the fields, the attackers capture the information. To make matters worse, once they gain access to a person's inbox, they immediately reconnoiter the compromised account and prepare to launch their next bombardment. They find past emails and attachments, create boobytrapped-image versions, drum up believable subject lines, and then target the person's contacts.

And so the vicious cycle of hijackings continues.

For more on email, watch:

Google Chrome users can protect themselves by checking the address bar and making sure a green lock symbol appears before entering their personal information into a site. Because scammers have been known to create HTTPS-protected phishing sites, which also display a green lock, it's also important to make sure this appears alongside a proper, intended URL—without any funny business preceding it.

In addition, people should add two-step authentication, an added layer of security that can help prevent account takeovers. Experts recommend using a dedicated security token as well.

A Google spokesperson acknowledged the scam in an email and directed Fortune to a statement:

We’re aware of this issue and continue to strengthen our defenses against it. We help protect users from phishing attacks in a variety of ways, including: machine learning based detection of phishing messages, Safe Browsing warnings that notify users of dangerous links in emails and browsers, preventing suspicious account sign-ins, and more. Users can also activate two-step verification for additional account protection.

AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T ) is doing all it can to make sure that it is dominant in the 21st Century as it was throughout the 20th.

Its recent megadeal to buy satellite television provider DirecTV for $49 billion was just the beginning of its strategy to build a strong vertical presence across content channels. It has since bundled DirecTV services with T stock's mobile platform and offers data-free viewing for AT&T subscribers.

While other content providers are not happy with this deal and have taken their case to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the new change in leadership in D.C. may well see an FCC that less concerned with net neutrality and more concerned with business interests.

TWX and T Stock

The other big front that T is working on is the purchase of Time Warner Inc (NYSE: TWX ) for a whopping $85 billion. The Barack Obama administration, and even President-elect Donald Trump have raised concerns about the deal. But the CEO and a senior AT&T VP were seen Thursday morning at Trump Tower in New York for a 9:30 a.m. meeting with the future president.

There's little doubt what that discussion was about. Now we will see if T stock made any headway.

But getting into AT&T is a good idea, because approval of the TWX deal isn't factored into the stock right now, and it's likely if the deal doesn't go through in its entirety, there will be the possibility of revising the deal to make both T and the government happy.

T was up 20% in the past 12 months but has just gotten back near its 52-week highs in recent weeks. After a solid run into the summer, the stock cooled in Q4. This is an encouraging sign. The profit takers are already out and the stock is moving on its merits moving forward.

Beyond the two megadeals (one pending), T stock is also not resting on its laurels in the mobile space. It's using its DirecTV bundle to attract cord cutters, who can stream over 100 channels of premium content for $60 a month. T is also launching a 5G test of its streaming services in Austin, Texas in the coming year.

5G is 10-100 times faster than 4G streaming. This is a bold move into cutting-edge technology and this is the value of having a content partner like DirecTV. T can now offer content at much higher speeds than its competitors, which will be a big value for cord cutters and mobile gamers. T is so much more than a telecom at this point, and if the TWX deal goes through, the increased ad sales alone will be enormous.

On the other side of all this growth is the fact that T is one of the Dividend Aristocrats. That means it has raised its dividend every year for more than 25 years. In its case 32 years and counting. What's more, T throws off a very attractive 4.8% dividend.

The bottom line is, there are plenty of reasons to be bullish on T stock, even during this time of transition.

While some have speculated CBS (CBS) might be a natural buyer, perhaps the most obvious one of all isn't an old-world media conglomerate, but rather a new one -- YouTube.

The Google-owned (GOOG) video-sharing website and not CBS, Paramount, Fox or any other major conglomerate would make the most sense for Sony Pictures, should the Japanese-based conglomerate want to offload the unit.

Unlike the aforementioned companies, YouTube (via its parent company, Alphabet), has the balance sheet to do such a deal. At the end of the third-quarter, Alphabet had more than $83 billion in cash and cash equivalents, plenty enough to swallow a deal for Sony Pictures, which could go for as much as $20 or $30 billion, depending upon the math.

The Hollywood Reporter has mentioned CBS (as have others) as a potential buyer of Sony Pictures and it makes sense. Les Moonves has long wanted to own a movie studio and it's the only major U.S.-based media conglomerate without a significant movie studio (CBS Films is small in comparison to Warner Bros., Universal, 20th Century Fox, Walt Disney [DIS] and Paramount).

However, Moonves lacks the balance sheet that Google/YouTube has, despite having the same ambitions.

Like CBS and its CBS All-Access over-the-top service (which has more than 1 million subscribers), YouTube has its own streaming service, YouTube Red. By owning Sony Pictures, Google/YouTube could create exclusive, must-see content for YouTube Red.

Sony Pictures has the license for a great number of Marvel characters (Spider-Man and his whole universe, as well as several others), all of whom could be given television shows of their own. It would also potentially be the home to James Bond for a continued number of years, with the franchise's home in doubt, as the most recent movie, Spectre, was the last one under the existing contract at Sony.

For those concerned it would potentially harm competition, there's no reason Sony would not continue to honor existing contracts that the studio has with services like Netflix (NFLX), Hulu, Amazon (AMZN) and others. It would lose much needed revenue and relationships, especially at a time when both are becoming harder to come by and maintain.

Press reports had mentioned that Viacom ex-CEO Phillippe Dauman had wanted to sell a stake in its movie studio, Viacom, valuing the studio as much as $10 billion (which ironically, was the price it acquired Paramount for more than 20 years ago).

Given that Sony Pictures generated around $8 billion in revenue in fiscal 2016 (far more than Paramount), it's a good bet that it could be valued significantly higher than the $10 billion valuation of Paramount, leaving a potential buyer to a select few.

YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki has talked about making original content, but not at the rate that Netflix or Amazon have done, due to its service being ad supported. However, owning Sony Pictures and putting TV shows on YouTube Red could help give the service a boost, given its reliance on subscriptions for revenues, not advertising.

Should Sony ever decide to put Sony Pictures on the block, YouTube would be crazy not to take a look at it, especially considering the importance content will have going forward in deciding which streaming service captures mind-share, as well as market share. And at a price tag of $20 billion, there are few companies that could swallow that pill. Google, however, is one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of the game is to surround empty spaces or your opponent's pieces (called stones) with your own, and remove surrounded pieces from the board. The complexity arises from the 19 by 19 grid containing 361 squares. The number of possible moves in a game exceeds the number of atoms in the universe.

In an online community known for attracting world class Go players, a previously unknown and enigmatic opponent going by the moniker ""Master"" emerged. Master played and won more than 50 consecutive games against some of the top players in the world. Among those players was Ke Jie, described as a 19-year-old prodigy, currently the top ranked Go player in the world. The unusual style of play led some to speculate that the Master might not be human. Those suspicions were confirmed in a tweet by Demis Hassabis, the CEO of DeepMind, a division of Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google. The mysterious Master was AlphaGo, DeepMind's artificial intelligence-based (AI) system.

Computers have been defeating their human counterparts for some time. In 1997, Garry Kasparov was defeated by IBM supercomputer Deep Blue in a chess match. This was the first time that artificial intelligence had defeated a reigning world champion. Likewise in 2007, scientists created a computer program called Chinook that cannot be beat at checkers. It evaluates every possible move and even if its human opponent plays flawlessly, the best they can hope to achieve is a draw. So how is this different? In earlier victories, the computer program ""memorized"" every potential move and mathematically calculated the odds of success for each. By using the ""brute force"" technique, the computer was able to quickly determine the outcome of every potential move and choosing the one that leads to success. Deep Blue processed 200 million board positions per second in determining its next move. On the other hand, AlphaGo contains a neural network that mimic's the human brain's capacity to learn. These software models and complex algorithms allow the system to ""learn"" from its past mistakes and use what it has learned going forward. AlphaGo made headlines last year by beating the second-ranked player in the world at Go, a feat many thought impossible.

Life is short, play more

Games are the most effective ways for scientists to develop and test their systems. By gauging the system's ability to conquer game tasks, they are able to more accurately assess how successful a system will be at providing solutions for real-world challenges. Artificial intelligence systems have been playing and winning increasingly complex games that enable real-world applications. Learning to play the game Civilization enabled a computer to better understand language by having the system digest the manual and apply the rules to playing the game. This led to advances in natural language processing.

DeepMind's AI-based Deep-Q Network was loaded with 49 Atari games and not given instructions on how to play.

Deep-Q learned to play Atari games. Image source: Pixabay .

By providing the input of the video pixels of the game including the score and allowing the system to experiment with random keystrokes, the system learned to play and win 29 of the 49 games, without ever being given the rules or the objective. DeepMind believes this will eventually lead to general learning systems, machines that can think -- the holy grail of AI.

A team from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and TU Darmstadt used Grand Theft Auto to improve their systems' visual learning algorithms by automating the process of identifying images used to train the system. The results were astounding as the automation was 1,000 times faster. The team believes that its success will lead to additional breakthroughs in computer vision tasks.

Teams at Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Research Lab created an AI training platform on the game Minecraft that allows its system to learn from and collaborate with human players, perform a range of simple to complex tasks, and understand complicated environments. They anticipate that this will accelerate deep learning by teaching the systems to understand and navigate three-dimensional spaces.

The Foolish final word

Games provide researchers with an effective tool for training and evaluating their AI systems. As the complexity of the games they conquer increases, so does their ability to solve real-world problems.

Katja Hofmann of the Microsoft Research Lab had this to say: ""I think what's underappreciated is the power of these platforms to really increase the speed of innovation, to allow us to very rapidly make progress in the underlying learning technology, and the fact that this will translate into better algorithms for real-world applications.""

Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ) had a respectable performance for the past year, gaining some 16%.

(NASDAQ: AMZN ), which mustered 40% gains for its shareholders.

Of course, for Alphabet Inc, the company will not have the same kind of high-growth rates of past. The revenue base is simply too massive.

This does not mean the stock will somehow get stuck, however. If anything, there are some positive long-term drivers that should benefit shareholders in the coming year and beyond. Let's take a look at three:

GOOGL Stock Driver #1 - Tech Megatrends

While the online advertising industry has been around for over two decades, there remains lots of room for growth. According to IDC, the global spending is forecast to go from $177.3 billion in 2015 to $315.7 billion in 2020 . Some of the key drivers include: the ubiquity of internet access and smartphones, the advantages of tracking/analytics, personalization, and the increased use of video.

All this is certainly good news for holders of GOOGL stock. Consider that the company derives about 90% of its revenues from online advertising. More importantly, Alphabet has a tremendous platform, which includes seven properties that have over a billion users (the main Google property, YouTube, Gmail, Maps, Chrome, Android and Play).

The result is that the company is getting an outsized share of the online ad opportunity. In the latest quarter, GOOGL reported a 20% increase in revenues to $22.45 billion. Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai, said: ""Our services are prime time for the mobile world."" After all, Alphabet Inc controls a whopping 95% of the mobile search market.

GOOGL Stock Driver #2 - Bold Innovation

From inception, the DNA of GOOGL has been about pushing the envelope on innovation. Granted, sometimes there have been embarrassing flops. But hey, this is critical for achieving success (keep in mind the countless times Thomas Edison failed until he figured out the light bulb).

So yes, the company has continued to release innovative products. Some of the recent ones include the Pixel phone, Duo (a video chat app), Google Home (a voice-activated speaker) and Allo (a smart messaging app).

But perhaps the technology that has the most potential to be transformative for GOOGL stock is artificial intelligence. The company's long history of building and leveraging massive databases is definitely a huge advantage (the knowledge base consist of over 70 billion facts about people, places and things).

Basically, with AI, the opportunity is to make technology natural and seamless - not something you need to activate, enter information into or boot up. In other words, the systems will crunch data to learn and adapt.

Oh, and the monetization could be enormous. As InvestorPlace.com's Aaron Levitt recently wrote :

""In the end, Alphabet is setting itself up to be the absolute king of data collection. Moving beyond the desktop and mobile phone and into our daily lives is the next step in how it will better compete and drive advertising sales. This shift is the next evolution in its business model.""

GOOGL Stock Driver #3 - Financials and Valuation

Alphabet Inc is a cash machine.

In the latest quarter, operating cash flows came to a hefty $9.8 billion. In all, there is $83.1 billion in the bank - of which $50 billion is overseas. Basically, if Donald Trump enacts policies on repatriation, Alphabet Inc will be in a position to bring home these foreign balances, which can be used for R&D, acquisitions and buybacks.

But, with the forward price-earnings multiple just under 20, the valuation on GOOGL stock is also reasonable. To put this into perspective, the S&P 500 is at about 19 times forward earnings. Yet, many of the mega caps in the index do not have the potential long-term growth rates of Alphabet stock.

Of the tech stocks with earnings reports around the corner, IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) will be some of the most high-profile reports to watch. Here's a brief overview of what to look for when each company reports results.

All eyes on strategic imperatives

International Business Machines is the first of these two companies scheduled to report quarterly results. IBM will report results after market close this Thursday and will host a conference call to discuss results at 5:00 PM ET.

IBM investors have recently turned their focus toward IBM's more nascent strategic imperatives, or the company's cloud, analytics, mobility, and security offerings. Growing to 40% of total revenue one year earlier than the company was targeting, IBM's strategic imperatives are growing faster than the rest of its business. While total third-quarter revenue was flat year over year, strategic imperatives revenue was up a nice 16%.

For investors to remain optimistic about IBM's strategic imperatives, look for this segment's growth to match or exceed the 16% growth achieved in Q4.

On average, analysts expect IBM to report total fourth-quarter revenue and EPS of $21.7 billion and $4.89, respectively. In IBM's fourth quarter of 2015 the company reported revenue and EPS of $22.1 billion and $4.84, respectively.

Can steep revenue growth persist?

For Alphabet, which reports its fourth-quarter results exactly one week after IBM, revenue growth will be key. Alphabet's core Google advertising business has been firing on all cylinders, helping total revenue and EPS exceed expectations in the company's most recent quarter. The company reported 20% and 23% year-over-year growth in revenue and EPS in Q3, respectively, as aggregate paid clicks, or the total number of clicks advertisers pay Google for, soared 9% sequentially and 33% year over year.

Image source: The Motley Fool.

While Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat has warned that tougher year-over-year comparisons will make similar growth in Q4 unlikely, analysts are still modeling for a sharp hike in the company's top line. On average, analysts expect Alphabet's revenue to increase 18% year over year. Can the company's ad revenue continue strongly enough to help the company achieve such a strong increase in total revenue, even when the company is up against a tough year-ago comparison?

The consensus analyst estimate for Alphabet's fourth-quarter revenue and non-GAAP EPS is $25.1 billion and $9.66, respectively. These estimates imply 18% and 11% year-over-year growth in revenue and non-GAAP EPS, respectively.

After Alphabet reports its fourth-quarter results on Thursday, Jan. 26, the company will host a live conference call to discuss the results at 4:30 PM ET.

Investors can stay up-to-date on how these companies performed by checking in on their quarterly earnings releases, listening to their quarterly conference calls, and by staying tuned at The Motley Fool for some post-earnings analysis.

What happened

Shares of Yandex N.V. (NASDAQ: YNDX) climbed 29.5% in 2016, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence , after the Russian internet search leader demonstrated broad-based growth in its first three quarterly reports of the year. Yandex also made progress in its antitrust complaint in the country against Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) global internet search behemoth, Google.

So what

To be sure, essentially all of Yandex's share price appreciation last year came on the heels of three successive quarterly earnings beats , punctuated by strong growth from each of its search and portal, e-commerce, taxi, classifieds, and ""experiments"" segments' revenue.

But shares have also taken a breather since Yandex's most recent quarterly report in late October. At the time, Yandex confirmed fiscal Q3 2016 revenue had climbed 25% year over year to 19.29 billion Russian Rubles (RUR), including 21% growth in search and portal revenue, to 17.48 billion RUR; 45% growth in e-commerce revenue, to 1.2 billion RUR; 151% growth in taxi revenue, to 587 million RUR; and a 45% increase in classifieds revenue, to 352 million RUR. Revenue from Yandex's ""experiments"" segment, which notably includes media segments like Yandex.Radio and Yandex.Music, also nearly doubled, to 210 million RUR.

At the same time, Yandex saw its share of the Russian search market (including mobile) decline to 55.9% for the quarter, compared to 57% and 57.6% in the second and first quarters of the year, respectively. To blame, Yandex management stated, was a renewed push from Google on its own applications through notifications and other activities.

Yandex also confirmed to investors that the Russian Federal Anti-Monopoly Service (FAS) had previously issued an ""unprecedented decision prescription to Google to cease anti-competitive practices,"" namely referring to Google's requirement for pre-installed Google products and services on their Android mobile devices. That decision was upheld by two separate courts since then and came into force in August. But because Google had not ""implemented the FAS prescription,"" according to Yandex, the FAS opened an administrative investigation into its noncompliance.

Now what

Unless we receive further clarification in the meantime, you can bet Yandex investors will be listening closely for any updates to the antitrust complaint when Yandex releases fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 results next month. For now, however, given its relative strength and broad growth despite competitive pressure from Google, it's no surprise that Yandex stock staged such an impressive rally in 2016.

If the new AI-powered, flagship smartphone from Rubin's company lives up to the hype, the Samsung (OTCMKTS: SSNLF ) Galaxy S8 and the next Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Pixel Phone may be the least of Apple's worries this year.

Re-Introducing Andy Rubin

A one-time Apple engineer, Andy Rubin quickly became a serious threat to the company's mobile ambitions. In 2003, he co-founded Android. When Alphabet's Google bought the mobile operating system in 2005, he became the Google senior vice president responsible for Android.

Rubin continued in the position until 2013, when he took over Google's robotics division before leaving the company altogether in 2014.

Now, Rubin is back in the spotlight with his own company - Essential - which is focused on artificial intelligence. And it features a flagship smartphone as its product centerpiece.

The Essential Smartphone

Bloomberg was the first to report on Andy Rubin's new company after CES 2017. According to Bloomberg , Rubin is in discussion with mobile carriers, including Sprint Corp (NYSE: S ), about the Essential smartphone.

The device is still in the prototype stage, but sources say Rubin is planning to launch it by the middle of the year, at a $649 price point. That would mean a new flagship smartphone hitting shelves just months before the iPhone 8 . It would add to the tough competition of the Galaxy S8, which will be heavily promoted by Samsung, as well as the follow-up version of Google's Pixel Phone.

The Essential smartphone may pose an even bigger threat to the iPhone 8 than these two Android front-runners.

Bloomberg's sources describe a smartphone with a larger display than the iPhone 7 Plus, but a smaller form factor because the Essential smartphone has an edge-to-edge display that lacks bezels. A magnetic connector does double-duty for charging and as a port for hardware accessories, including a spherical 360-degree camera. The screen could be pressure-sensitive, like the iPhone's. And Essential is reportedly working on a ceramic back, which would utilize the same premium material used in AAPL's latest flagship Apple Watch Edition Series 2 .

Behind it all, the Essential smartphone would feature advanced AI technology, which would take on Siri.

Is This a Real Threat to the iPhone 8?

On one hand, it's easy to dismiss the Essential smartphone. It's still in the prototype phase, and if its design is finalized, it may ultimately lack some of the features like the ceramic back. There are big unanswered questions, too, including what operating system it will run.

And then there's the dubious success rate of companies trying to muscle their way into a mature smartphone market. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) found this out the hard way when its Fire Phone flopped several years ago.

On the other hand, Andy Rubin has a proven track record. He's very well-connected in the industry and has been successful in raising capital. His Playground Global hardware incubator raised $300 million in 2015 . According the Bloomberg report, Rubin is actively in talks with not just Sprint over distribution, but also Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. (OTCMKTS: HNHPF ) - better known as Foxconn - as a manufacturing partner for the Essential smartphone.

Rubin also has a team of engineers recruited from Google and Apple working on the phone, with a former Samsung executive heading up marketing.

The Essential smartphone could be a credible threat. Its mid-2017 target release date gives it a shot: Samsung is still recovering from the Galaxy Note 7 PR nightmare, Google's Pixel Phone has yet to capture significant market share and the iPhone 8 will be months away.

If the Essential smartphone lives up to its billing, with a powerful AI and premium design, and gets a push from carriers like Sprint, it could be a big deal.

That would be a serious problem for AAPL, which is counting on the iPhone 8 launch to re-ignite its stalled iPhone sales.

As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is the parent company of Google, the undisputed leader of online search and digital advertising. Its dominance hasn't gone unnoticed by investors, who have bid the shares up towards their all-time highs.

Source: Brionv via Wikimedia (Modified)

Yet Google is no moonshot, which is the term it has used to describe the venture capital activities in its ""Other Bets"" segment. This includes self-driving cars and its Nest franchise, which actually has some sales and helps consumers more efficiently heat and cool their homes.

The question for investors going forward is if Alphabet can continue to dominate online advertising. It and Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) controlled 50% of the $60 billion online ad market in 2015. Google controlled half of the market, or $30 billion. Facebook's take was $8 billion, but is also growing rapidly.

GOOG Stock Isn't Stopping

Alphabet's sales growth has been meteoric. It is projected to report sales of nearly $90 billion for all of 2016 (the final year results have yet to be fully reported) and that should jump to above $100 billion this year (calendar 2017). That will mark a roughly 10-fold increase from the $10.6 billion it reported in 2006.

Extrapolating those figures out another decade, Alphabet stands a chance at generating over $1 trillion in revenue. That is certainly a tall order, but the network effect (where a product or service grows more valuable as more people use it) is proving to be one of the greatest growth drivers capitalism has ever seen.

Of course, there is a downside to such dominance. The European Union has been attacking Google, alleging it is abusing its dominant position to block out competition and keep internet surfers dependent on its services. Specifically, it has suggested that Google pushes hard to make its search engine the default on smart phones and computers. It's not always easy being on top.

The worries over Google's dominance echo the control Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) held over personal computers back in the 1990s. In similar fashion, the U.S. Justice Department accused Microsoft of using its personal computing software dominance to push its Internet Explorer internet browser, which helped end the Netscape browser era that helped pioneer online search and browsing the world wide web.

Google's dominance won't last forever, but there is little reason to see it going away any time soon. In the next two years, analysts see earnings growing at a mid-teens percentage rate to above $41 per share for all of this year. It is a huge beneficiary of the growth in everything digital as consumers increasingly shop and socialize online.

Based off the current stock price of $803 per share, the forward price-to-earnings multiple of GOOG stock is below 20, or right about the market multiple. That is a very reasonable multiple for one of the best large-cap growth stories in the market today. Facebook is also compelling, but represents a higher growth candidate with higher risk - due mostly to its higher valuation.

I recently detailed that I think Microsoft isn't growing fast enough to justify where the stock is trading at currently. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) represents an interesting story among large technology companies, but is much more tied to its iPhone and related hardware, which is growing more slowly and becoming more of a commodity as competitors copy its revolutionary smart phone product and apps that consumers download.

In another sign of Google's dominance, it recently was reported that the Google Android operating system was used in nine out of 10 smart phones being sold. Its market share of the smart phone market was pegged at 87.5%, far exceeding Apple's iOS operating system. Consumers are increasingly using their smart phones to access the web.

Google has specialized in releasing appealing products and services that help drive use of its search engines and drive advertising revenue. The offerings include Android, Google Maps, Google search, voice recognition on its phones, and a new Pixel phone that has received decent reviews.

Bottom Line on GOOG

There will likely come a time when the market grows concerned with either Google's dominance, or starts to worry about slowing growth. Significant EU fines or allegations could also send the share price off recent highs. But at this point, any dip in the stock price represents a buying opportunity.

The share price is also a reasonable value given the growth prospects. Cash flow generation is great, and there is a good chance that management starts paying a dividend at some point in the future.

There is also the potential that a moonshot investment revolutionizes a market. Self-driving cars is certainly a candidate, and Google's initial interest with the technology has helped drive innovation in the space.

1/17/2017,0.345088099,0.04631465,807.08,807.14,800.37,804.61,1362115,6.77,-2.47,0,"E-commerce giants Amazon ( AMZN ) and Alibaba ( BABA ) have both reported massive growth in their cloud computing businesses over the past few years. Alibaba Cloud and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have outpaced the growth in total worldwide spending on cloud computing and infrastructure services. Alibaba has grown at a faster pace than Amazon, primarily due to the fact that it predominantly operates in China, which is a relatively nascent and fast-growing market. In terms of scale, Alibaba's cloud computing revenues are much lower than Amazon's AWS revenues, as shown below.

Strong Revenue Growth For Amazon & Alibaba

Both Amazon and Alibaba have continued to witness strong growth rates in terms of revenue as well as profit margins in 2016. Amazon reported operating profit margin of 26.2% for its AWS division for Q2'16 and Q3'16 combined, which was almost 8 percentage points higher than the prior year period. Similarly, Alibaba also witnessed a drastic improvement in operating margin in the same period. Although the margin for Alibaba Cloud is still negative, it has shown quarter over quarter improvement through the year. It is likely that Alibaba Cloud could become profitable for the company over the next couple of years.

It should be noted that we have used only June and September quarter figures for comparison since Alibaba just started reporting segment-wise margins in the June quarter last year.

Role of Cloud Business In Driving Company Growth

While both companies are enjoying strong revenue growth in their cloud businesses, there is a huge difference in the contribution of cloud to net profits. Amazon purchases products at wholesale rates and stores the inventory at Amazon Fulfillment Centers and sells them as Amazon Verified Products. This helps in weeding out fake and counterfeit products from its listings - something that Alibaba has reportedly struggled with over the last few quarters. Therefore, Alibaba's operating profit margin is significantly higher than Amazon's, since it does not maintain inventory and primarily acts as the aggregator between buyers and sellers. As a result, Amazon's e-commerce business contributes 92% of net revenues but only a third of the company-wide operating profits. Comparatively, Alibaba's e-commerce segments combined generate 84% of net revenues and a whopping 169% of operating income.

AWS is effectively helping Amazon expand its e-commerce business in international markets where it is operating at a loss . On the other hand, Alibaba is financing its cloud business and other new ventures such as digital media, entertainment and online video through the profits generated by its core commerce segments.

Robust Long-Term Outlook For Cloud

According to an estimate by Market Research Media, the global cloud computing market is likely to continue to grow at 30% through 2020 to become a $270 billion market similar pace over the next few years. Moreover, the cloud computing market in China could grow at a CAGR of about 45% over the next few years, according to an estimate by Bain & Company. We forecast AWS revenues to grow at almost 30% over the next few years, while Alibaba Cloud revenues could grow at 40% in the same period.

According to an updated version of the Google App, its users will simply make use of their voices. The new enhancement is one of the capabilities that will enable the assistant to cope against the likes of Alexa, which is also coming up very fast.

With the new integration, it is clear that Google assistant is quickly becoming more and more useful. Having being found through a string of code found in the beta Google App version 6.11.13, the new functionality is unique. However, the service may not be up yet given the appearance of the words, “you’ll soon be able to pay for things” under the Google Assistant options.

The assistant will allow specification of devices that can access payments

The new service is currently rolling out only to beta users even though it is said that the strings have existed from a few version before this one. However, the XDA Developers have outlined that there will be the need to specify a delivery address of whatever the user is paying for, the billing and shipping address. This brings online shopping into the picture and one can access payment alternatives to finish up on their transactions.

Nonetheless, even with its limited availability, the developer’s report further says that the feature is to some extent baked into the Google Assistant APK. Hence it could be on its way to users very soon perhaps after Google is through with flipping the switch to turn on and off.

Virtual assistants are finally becoming part of people’s lifestyles

The world is revolving very fast taking up new features of the technology that will enhance people’s lifestyles. This is exactly the same thing that virtual assistants seem to be doing. Surprisingly, Google has further plans; to expedite its efforts for the growth of its assistant into becoming a robust mediator of your day-to-day activities. In any case, it has already demonstrated its capabilities. Meanwhile, Alphabet’s stock closed at $830.94 an increase of $1.41 or 0.17%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alphabet stock underperformed the market by a significant margin in 2016.

This can be attributed to investors worrying about Google's declining margins and rising costs.

This might however, change once investors start focusing more on the company's growth outlook.

Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock badly underperformed the market in 2016, finishing with a modest return of just 2% vs. 11% by the S&P 500. More notably, GOOGL stock underperformed its FANG counterparts consisting of Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), with all but Netflix finishing the year with double-digit gains. The stock appears to have taken a breather after rallying hard - 45% over the previous 2 years.

GOOGL stock is undervalued

While GOOGL stock has underperformed, Alphabet has continued posting strong top and bottom line growth, and the shares now look undervalued. At a valuation of 10 times EBITDA versus 19.2 times for Amazon and 13.5 times for Facebook, the shares look cheaper than what the company's growth calls for, suggesting the market has not fully priced-in Google's strong growth.

According to Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak, the underperformance by GOOG stock can be chalked up to Alphabet's deteriorating core margins and investors focusing on deleveraging of traffic acquisition costs. Alphabet's operating margin has fallen sharply from 35.4% in 2010 to 26.3% currently. Margins have been eroding due to falling CPCs (Cost Per Click) and rising traffic acquisition costs.

Google's Cost-Per-Click has continued declining due to the increasing exposure to international markets. More than half the company's revenue comes from international markets, where lower ad pricing and adverse effects of a strong dollar are major headwinds. Meanwhile, Google's search ads form the bulk of its revenue and command better prices than display ads on platforms like YouTube due to higher engagement rates. Unfortunately, Google's search business is becoming increasingly saturated making it harder for search CPC to improve.

Google's increasing traffic acquisition costs, or TAC, have also been pressuring margins. TAC refers to the fees the company pays to partner websites that run Google ads. The portion of TAC that Google pays to distribution partners to make its search engine the default option on rival platforms such as the iOS on iPhones jumped 33% during the last quarter, much higher than the top line growth of 20%. Google says this trend is due to the fact that its strongest growth areas, including mobile and programmatic advertising, naturally have higher TAC.

Why these concerns are overblown

It appears as if investors have been overreacting and missing the forest for the trees. Google remains by far the most dominant ad company with good growth runways. During the past few quarters, revenue growth has been accelerating, a remarkable feat for a company its size. Indeed, Google stock has kicked off the year on a strong note after racking up gains of 4.7% in the first two weeks of trading. That's better than the 1.6% gained by the S&P 500, but worse than Facebook's 9.6%, Amazon's 6.6%, and Netflix's 5.4% over the timeframe.

Meanwhile, Google websites and new initiatives like the Pixel remain in the pink of health. Google derives 80% of its revenue from its own websites rather than partner sites. And the good news is that revenue on Google websites has consistently been growing much faster than AdSense revenue from partner sites. During the last quarter, Google websites brought in revenue of $16,089 million, up 23% Y/Y, while Google's partner revenue was $3,732 million, up a mere 1%. The huge disparity in growth rates could be the result of Google cracking down hard on low-quality sites that try to game marketers by offering search spam. But it also has a more nuanced side: Google is increasingly relying less and less on partner sites for its revenue, meaning its TAC is likely to remain under control.

Meanwhile, Pixel has been one of the company's most successful hardware innovations. Morgan Stanley estimates the company will sell ~6 million units in 2017, bringing in $4 billion in revenue and $900 million in gross profit. 6 million units pale in comparison with what Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) manages with the iPhone - more than 200 million units sold in 2016. $4 billion might also not look like much for a company with annual revenue of nearly $80 billion. Yet, the Pixel is an important part of Alphabet because it's actually the only non-search segment that's profitable. Alphabet's ''Other Bets'' have been growing too slowly, while posting huge losses and acting as a big drag on the company's bottom line. Other Bets contributed less than $800 million to the company's top line over the past 12 months, but posted a huge operating loss of nearly $4 billion.

Pixel will also give Alphabet a means to offer a more integrated and consistent Android experience to the more than 1.4 billion Android users worldwide. Pixel might not grow into the iPhone-killer it was originally hyped to become, but it's likely to lead to materially faster revenue and profit growth for Alphabet in the coming years.

The bottom line on GOOGL stock

Investors have been focusing too much on the finer details of Alphabet's growth metrics and in the process missing the bigger picture. But with the company's growth on an uptick and the shares looking significantly undervalued, it's only a matter of time before the market rewards GOOGL stock investors. With earnings projected to grow at nearly 18% in 2017, double-digit gains for Google stock might be on the cards.

Throughout the year, Facebook continued to push video -- particularly live video -- investing millions of dollars in deals with celebrities, publishers, and creators.

Still, for all the time users spend watching video, Facebook has struggled to monetize any of it directly. Creators are hesitant to publish videos to Facebook as they could be sacrificing potential earnings from YouTube -- the video-sharing website operating under Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google.



Facebook's dedicated video section. Image source: Facebook.

Facebook's latest attempt, according to a report from Recode , is mid-roll ads that will play in longer videos (at least 90 seconds). Facebook will split revenue with creators 55-45 in favor of creators, the same split as YouTube.

Monetizing video is one of Facebook's biggest opportunities, and mid-roll video ads would represent its most promising effort yet.

Video advertising for everyone

Facebook has made several attempts to monetize video views directly. It tried post-roll video ads when it showed highlights of the NFL a couple of years ago. It tried inserting ads between videos in its dedicated video section on mobile, but many publishers were upset that revenue was split based on watchtime.

Last year, Facebook started letting publishers work directly with sponsors to monetize their videos, but Facebook didn't take a cut. It also started experimenting with mid-roll ads in live videos for specific publishers, splitting the ad revenue with them

Apparently, those mid-roll video ad tests were good enough to roll out the feature to more users. Recode says publishers will be able to insert ads into their pre-recorded videos as long as the videos are at least 90 seconds long. The ads must play after at least 20 seconds of organic video watch time.

The format is long enough for savvy creators to grab viewers' attention, set up a reason to stay tuned, and transition to the advertisement. While it doesn't provide the benefit of forcing users to watch ads like the pre-roll format on YouTube, creators could see a larger percentage of users actually sit through the complete ad on Facebook if they do a good job creating the video and enticing users to stay tuned. A recent survey from LaunchLeap found that just 29% of U.S. Millennials watch YouTube ads to completion.

An incremental opportunity

The important thing to note is that inserting ads mid-roll into videos represents an incremental opportunity for Facebook. CFO Dave Wehner warned analysts that ad revenue growth will ""come down meaningfully"" by the middle of this year due to ad load constraints. If the new ads work, it provides another avenue for Facebook to sneak ads into users' feeds.

YouTube generated an estimated $12 billion in revenue in 2016. Following Facebook's disclosure of 100 million hours of video watchtime per day, YouTube made a point of pointing out its users watch ""hundreds of millions"" of hours of video every day.

Even if Facebook users still watch less video than on YouTube, the Google subsidiary represents the potential for inserting ads into Facebook videos. For reference, Facebook generated $24.7 billion in revenue over the last 12 months.

One small negative

There is one small negative impact of mid-roll video ads. The new revenue sharing agreement would significantly reduce Facebook's operating margin on those ad units. So far, Facebook has largely benefited from what is essentially free content. It posted an operating margin of 45% in the third quarter, significantly higher than Alphabet's 25% operating margin.

There's also the possibility that mid-roll ads could cannibalize some of Facebook's stand-alone video ads. That would amplify the negative impact on Facebook's margins. On the other hand, it would mean more creators are opting to use mid-roll ads, which likely means higher-quality videos on Facebook and more user engagement. That ought to more than offset the negative impact on margins.

The growth of video on Facebook is great, and it has led to more user engagement. Unless Facebook can find a way to directly monetize those video views, however, that engagement isn't worth much. Mid-roll ads are the most promising effort yet, and they could lead to continued strong revenue growth at Facebook.

Consider these statistics from Checkmarx: Cybercrime is expected to cost businesses over $2 trillion annually by 2019, four times as much as 2015. In the U.S., a breach costs a company an estimated $15.4 million on average. Some hacks can be resolved in days, while others can take weeks or months.

These are more than mere statistics. Real-world examples abound. In December, Yahoo! revealed the largest known security breach to date, which compromised over 1 billion accounts, only months after it reported a separate breach involving 500 million users. These intrusions could take years to resolve and cost millions of dollars.

Cybercrime is an epidemic; IBM's Watson has your back. Image source: Pixabay .

IBM (NYSE: IBM) is rolling out a new weapon in cyberdefense: its Jeopardy! -winning cognitive supercomputer Watson. So how will a game show contestant help prevent hacking? Glad you asked, but first, a little background.

One of the technologies behind Watson is an artificial intelligence (AI) discipline known as deep learning. A software model of the brain is used to recreate our ability to learn. By using a massive number of examples, combined with sophisticated algorithms, the system learns to discover similarities among the examples and find differences. This results in the program mastering pattern recognition when reviewing large data sets.

Teaching Watson about cybercrime

IBM Watson is expanding its security protocol. Image source: Pixabay .

IBM announced earlier this year that it was partnering with eight universities in a year-long research project to provide Watson with the requisite data necessary to expand its security protocol. These universities were chosen on the strength of their cybersecurity programs. According to an IBM press release in May, the system was ""learning the nuances of security research findings and discovering patterns and evidence of cyberattacks and threats that could otherwise be missed."" Students and faculty input security data while Watson learned the peculiarities specific to cybersecurity. It planned to process up to 15,000 documents per month, building its database of threat intelligence reports, cybercrime strategies, and threat databases.

And the work is paying off. IBM recently announced that 40 organizations are now part of the Watson Cyber Security beta program. This group hails from a wide array of industries including banking, healthcare, insurance, finance, travel, energy, automotive, and education. IBM hopes that by increasing participation in the beta program, Watson will, over time, evolve into the next generation of cyberdefense.

""By applying intelligent technologies like machine learning and natural language processing, Watson can help security analysts make better decisions from structured data, as well as the massive amount of unstructured data that has been dark to an organization's defenses until now,"" IBM wrote in its press release.

Better detectives

Mixing AI and cyber-security holds a lot of promise. MIT announced earlier this year that an AI system had achieved an 85% success rate at detecting threats. This system, called AI Squared, differed from previous attempts at using AI for cyberdefense. Rather than simply referring all anomalies to its human counterparts, this experiment provided feedback from the analyst to the system, allowing it to learn from the input provided by its human counterparts. This improved the system's assessments over time, increasing the accuracy of future predictions.

This reduced the number of both false positives and false negatives, according to MIT. This is a quantum leap forward versus earlier outlier detection, which merely looks for anomalies that are then forwarded to a human technician for further assessment. This video from MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory illustrates the process:

Learning on their own

Google neural networks created their own encryption! Image source: Pixabay

IBM isn't the only player in this emerging field. While many big tech companies use varying degrees of artificial intelligence to help provide security for their cloud-computing operations, some are taking it to another level. In a research paper, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) division Google revealed that two neural networks had learned to build their own form of encryption, while a third was unable to crack that code. This is significant because they weren't taught about encryption or given any examples of encrypted and decrypted messages. Two neural networks were instructed to send communications to each other, and keep that information secret from the third. This is likely an early development toward a dynamic system that learns to protect itself. In its conclusion, the paper states: ""Finally, neural networks may be useful not only for cryptographic protections but also for attacks.""

With its massive data centers and cloud infrastructure, this development could further enhance Google's business and advance its already impressive AI credentials.

The Foolish final word

IBM has been leveraging Watson in a variety of ways. In adding cybersecurity to its resume, IBM hopes to capitalize on the inability of companies to keep pace with the growing threat posed by cybercrime. Sandy Bird, chief technology officer of IBM Security was quoted as saying in a press release:

Customers are in the early stages of implementing cognitive security technologies. Our research suggests this adoption will increase threefold over the next three years, as tools like Watson for Cyber Security mature and become pervasive in security operations centers. Currently, only seven percent of security professionals claim to be using cognitive solutions.

If Watson can capture just a portion of that threefold increase, its training has not been in vain.

In its famous 1984 commercial, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) portrayed International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) as Big Brother. Once the fiercest of rivals, the two companies are far more similar than different today. Beyond their size and maturity, Apple and IBM shares have also been on a tear over the past 12 months.

AAPL data by YCharts

Considering their many similarities, it's appropriate for investors to wonder whose shares are the more attractive potential buy today. To better answer this question, we'll put Apple and IBM stocks through a three-part analysis to gain a clearer sense of which one is the better buy now.

1. Financial fortitude

Let's cut to the chase here: Apple wins the contest of financial fortitude by a landslide. It deserves noting, though, that this is more due to Apple's historic profitability rather than any financial imprudence on IBM's part.

Company Cash and Investments Debt Cash From Operations Current Ratio Apple $237.5 billion $87.0 billion $65.8 billion 1.3 IBM $15.0 billion $42.4 billion $18.5 billion 1.2

Data sources: Apple investor relations, IBM investor relations, Yahoo! Finance.

Apple generates the bulk of its sales overseas, and its practice of keeping its cash offshore has triggered several not-so-small controversies in recent years. Apple held $216 billion of its cash overseas as of its most recent earnings report. That means Apple can't directly tap into the majority of its cash holdings without paying steep repatriation taxes. Rather, Apple borrows against its overseas cash to fund its capital return program.

Turning to IBM, Big Blue similarly has its financial house in order. Though it has leveraged its balance sheet to a certain extent, IBM generates plenty of cash flow to both service its debts and reinvest in its business. However, Apple's overall profitability simply can't be beat, making it the easy winner in this portion of our analysis.

Winner: Apple.

2. Durable competitive advantages

Turning to their competitive moats, Apple and IBM each enjoy some type of competitive advantage over their rivals. However, for both companies, their competitive advantages might not be as pronounced as they might initially seem.

Apple's platinum-grade brand, closed-loop operating system, consistent device leadership, and immense financial resources certainly all contribute to its ability to consistently generate above-average returns on capital. Some of these items should prove fairly straightforward. Apple's Fort Knox-esque cash reserves allow it to buy its way into virtually any industry that interests it. However, Apple's closed-loop software architecture receives far less attention but is arguably more important in terms of supporting Apple's competitive position.

In contrast to Alphabet 's Android or Microsoft 's Windows operating systems, Apple makes its software and app ecosystem available on its devices. That means users who migrate away from Apple's computers or mobile devices might not be able to bring their content with them, although third-party services such as Spotify have helped erode this situation in recent years. It also bears noting that Apple's product-driven sales model also presents something of a dormant risk. Should Apple somehow badly misstep with one of its annual device designs, its sales could suffer dramatically. Thanks to Apple's consistent device leadership, though, this situation has never come to fruition.

At IBM, the company's longtime relationships with customers and the large percentage of its sales that come from its legacy three-pronged business model provide it with something of a competitive moat as well. However, with the rise of the cloud-computing era and IBM's evolving place in that space, the company's competitive stance has perhaps weakened slightly. To cite one popular -- and important -- metric, IBM's sales have now declined for 18 consecutive quarters. IBM's backlog of prearranged service bookings also fell 0.7% in constant currency terms in its most recent quarter, although IBM still carries roughly 1.5 years' worth of revenue as bookings.

Winner: tie.

3. Valuation

On the surface, Apple and IBM appear to be comparably valued. In terms of their current P/E, forward P/E, and EV/EBITDA ratios, there appears to be little difference between the two at first glance.

Company P/E Ratio Forward P/E Ratio EV/EBITDA Apple 14.3 11.8 9.2 IBM 13.7 12.1 11.1

Data sources: Apple investor relations, IBM investor relations, Yahoo! Finance.

Pay extra attention to the EV/EBITDA ratio. It's arguably the most useful valuation metric, because it takes into account each company's equity, debt, and cash positions. This is particularly important to consider when analyzing a cash-rich company like Apple, which currently carries $12.73 in cash per share on its balance sheet. Subtracting that cash amount out gives investors a clearer sense of the value the market places on Apple's core operations.

Apple and IBM are both cheap compared with the market as a whole. In fact, after its recent rally, the S&P 500 benchmark trades at a valuation of 26, nearly double that of either Apple or IBM. This steep discount to the market reflects the view that Apple and IBM will probably exhibit little to no growth in the near term, which may not actually be the case. Though their revenue growth outlook isn't particularly rosy -- Apple and IBM sales are expected to rise 6% and fall 2%, respectively, this year -- both companies are among the most effective users of dividends and stock buybacks to drive shareholder returns. In terms of the overall attractiveness of their valuations, though, Apple wins this category as well.

Winner: Apple.

And the winner is... Apple

Apple's edge in two of the three categories examined here make the iPhone maker the more attractive option today. However, that isn't to say that IBM, especially in light of its own cheap valuation, is not a buy. In fact, I like both Apple and IBM shares as interesting potential buys at a time when cheap shares of high-quality companies are becoming increasingly scarce.

So while Apple is the technical winner of this exercise, investors looking for blue-chip technology stocks to buy would do well to further investigate both Apple and IBM shares today.

Today the company announced that the latest version of Google Maps on Android and iOS lets users request a ride from Uber without ever leaving the app. Previously, you could use Maps to check for price estimates and start the process of getting a lift, but eventually you had to finish things up in the Uber app. Now, the entire request process takes place directly in Google Maps. You just sign in with your Uber account info, which pulls up your stored payment info and other details.

The “ride services” section of Maps, as Google calls it, has been given a makeover with this new release. Instead of a list of services (Uber, Lyft, etc.) with pricing beside each one, now you’ll see the traditional on-screen map with a visual representation of where nearby drivers are. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem as though you can fully hail Lyft rides in-app for the time being.

Uber would probably prefer you stick with its redesigned app — and many people probably instinctively do that anyway instead of using Google Maps for requesting rides.

Image source: Waymo.

Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google just spun out its self-driving vehicle project, Waymo, into its own subsidairy company last month , and already it's making huge strides in the automotive space. Waymo CEO John Krafcik, announced at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit this week that the company has reduced the cost of its LIDAR sensor by a whopping 90%.

LIDAR -- which uses lasers to map the vicinity, in this case allowing a vehicle to see everything around it -- is one of the most expensive technologies on a self-driving vehicle, and cutting is cost could pave the way to profitability for Waymo.

What you get for the money

LIDAR is how self-driving vehicles see the world around them. The technology is pretty easy to spot on a car -- it's usually encased in a dome atop the vehicle. Inside that, a laser spits out pulses of light that, when reflected off of objects, give the car detailed information about the locations and movement of whatever is around it.

Waymo's new LIDAR system works the same way as earlier versions of the technology, but it's massively cheaper. Given that those older systems cost about $75,000, Krafcik's latest announcement implies that Waymo's new LIDAR probably costs about $7,500.

The more expensive LIDAR systems are arguably more accurate, but don't think that it means Waymo will be using a sub-par system for its upcoming self-driving services.

""The detail we capture is so high that not only can we detect pedestrians all around us, but we can tell which direction they're facing,"" Krafcik said. ""This is incredibly important, as it helps us more accurately predict where someone will walk next.""

Why cheaper is better

One of the likely reasons why Alphabet spun Waymo out into its own company is because it believes Waymo can stand on its own and produce its own revenue.

Waymo has said that it'll use its software and hardware for several different services, including personal transportation, ride hailing, logistics, and public transportation solutions. We'll likely get our first glimpse of its intentions later this year when it launches a service with Fiat Chrysler (NYSE: FCAU) . Waymo will begin testing self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans on public roads next month.

But just as with any company, Waymo will need to focus on becoming profitable. Google's been pretty strict lately with those of its subsidiary companies that aren't making money, and has paused several projects (I'm looking at you Google Fiber ) that haven't panned out as expected. Waymo will succeed or fail based on its ability to turn its promising tech into tangible -- and lucrative -- products and services.

The self-driving market will be worth an estimated $77 billion by 2035, and a total of nearly 76 million vehicles with some level of autonomy are expected to have been sold by that year.

As with any other technology, reducing the cost so that consumers can afford it is key to Waymo's success. This latest LIDAR cost reduction is great news for the company, and it means Waymo's ride-hailing service -- which it aims to launch later this year -- is one step closer to reality.

It would have to be pretty spectacular to beat 2015's $75.87 billion in sales and $18.31 billion, $3.28 per share, in net income.

The consensus among analysts is it will come close on both fronts, with revenues of $76.82 billion and net income of $3.22 per share of AAPL stock. Its cash hoard, $237 billion at the end of October , is continuing to grow and it will nearly top the entire GDP of Finland.

What investors should be asking, however, isn't what Apple has done, but what it is going to do.

AAPL's Future: Augmenting, Grounding Reality

Start with augmented reality, the technology you saw last year, in a primitive way, with the Pokemon Go phenomenon.

At CES, the German Carl Zeiss Meditec NPV (OTCMKTS: CZMWF ), which has a pair of Virtual Reality goggles in the market, had a booth in the augmented reality area but no product to show. Although it is still a rumor, Robert Scoble discovered solid evidence that the company is working with Apple on ""mixed reality"" glasses that could debut next year.

Augmented reality, as opposed to virtual reality, superimposes computer data on an existing world view. In the workplace, it can give repairmen instructions as they work. In addition to superimposing games on your worldview, it can also deliver marketing messages as you walk, or interface with your smartphone so you can see your directions as you drive, and don't forget what is on your to-do list.

Such a heads-up display from Apple would be a real breakthrough, transforming the way people work with technology from looking down at screens to looking up and saying what they want.

The breakthrough would lie in creating an interface that is not distracting to either the wearer or the people around them, as the ""Google glass"" effort from Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) proved to be.

That's not all. AAPL has also patented an armband that could deliver a host of health indicators , not just blood pressure and heart rate, to the wearer and their doctor. Wearables are currently stuck as fashion devices because they lack the precision and utility needed for Food and Drug Administration approval, but breaking through that wall would open a multi trillion-dollar market.

Apple Is Taking the High End

While most analysts focus on absolute market share, investors know that the key to a mass technology market lies in who has the high end, where the biggest profits lie. I was shocked over the holidays to find I am now the only member of my family still carrying an Android phone. All my relatives now have iPhones.

This not only gives Apple 90% of the market's profits, but allows it to extend the ecosystem back to the PC, where it is now the fourth-largest player in a stabilizing market and, on a per-unit basis, the most profitable.

While Android developers struggle to get free apps onto phones, AAPL's iOS will pass $1 trillion in revenue sometime this year, delivering $20 billion per year to developers and justifying its spending billions of dollars to build-out a network of cloud data centers.

Slice Intelligence estimates that Apple even had one-quarter of the wireless headphone market this Christmas with those Airpod units that analysts laughed at a few months ago. That's nearly as much as much as Beats and Bose combined.

So Much Winning for AAPL Stock

The bottom line is that Apple is still winning.

The iPad people thought was dead? It had a spectacular Christmas. The Apple Watch you thought was dead? It sold out. AAPL doubled-up on device activations compared with Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS: SSNLF ).

The earnings multiple for Apple, based on what most people considered a bad year, is 14.5. That's cheap. That's why AAPL stock is not one you trade, but one you own.

For years, my household has sided with Samsung phones. Until we recently had a phone literally catch fire. In our efforts to fix the phone (and while dealing with the thousand hoops that were imposed upon us) we ended up switching phones makers and providers.

The point of the story is this: One out of the three new phones ended up being an iPhone 7. This wasn't because we were shopping for it, but rather that it was suggested by the salesperson and offered free by the provider. Conclusion: AAPL will gain incremental business from Samsung regardless of who is shopping for what. It's what they call ""pin action.""

Fundamentally, I reiterate my statement that the AAPL machine will continue to offer an attractive stock value. But I have very little faith that Tim Cook is the right leader for it. What I do see attractive here is the technical upside potential. AAPL stock has the potential to retest the highs. The set up is available for the bulls.

The Trade: Buy AAPL Mar $120/$125 debit call spread. This is a bullish trade for which I pay $1.80 per contract. This is my maximum potential loss. If Apple stock rallies past my spread, I stand to double my money. Options are time sensitive, so the March contract allows 65 days to be proven right.

In this case, I want to hedge my bets by selling downside risk against AAPL value to lower my upside entry cost. I don't do this, however, unless I believe in the value of AAPL stock against which I am selling risk.



The Bank: Sell AAPL Jan 2018 $90 put. This is a bullish trade for which I collect $3 per contract. Selling naked puts is dangerous and I only do it if I am willing and able to own AAPL stock at the strike sold. If AAPL stock falls over 25% I could be assigned the stock. In which case, $87 per share would be my breakeven price. Anything lower would accrue losses.



Since AAPL earnings are not due for two weeks, I will likely delay selling the puts just in case they decide to correct a little.

It is important to note that the short-term reactions to earnings is a binary event. Meaning it's more gambling than investing. The quality of the report doesn't matter as much as it should. Wall Street is unpredictable with its reactions.

Furthermore, markets in general are at all-time-high levels. So if Trump doesn't deliver on much of his promises, we could see a market-wide correction. As long as my downside put level is not breached, any revenues captured from selling the long bet would be pure profits.

I am not required to hold trade into their expiration dates. I can close any of them for partial gains or losses.

From criticism such as poor design or what some perceived to be the product’s ability to infringe on personal space, there were tons of reasons why Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google Glass failed. Even advocates of the product couldn’t decide whether Glass should be used as a fashionable device all the time or just for specific practical functions.

Apparently, none of these reasons matter to Apple, which is rumored to be interested in its own glass product. And given Apple’s often unspoken strategy of not needing to be first to market, but perfecting the market, Apple — according to multiple reports — may be intent on using Google's failure to its advantage.

Rumors now suggest augmented reality is Apple’s next big thing — a pair of augmented reality glasses, to be specific. Apple blog site 9to5Mac on Tuesday said the Cupertino-based iPhone maker is working with with optical company Carl Zeiss to create the glasses, which has been described as a “light pair of augmented reality/mixed reality glasses.""

Exactly when these glasses will be released is unknown, though several reports suggest they could be launched as early as this year or in 2018. Of course, Apple hasn’t commented on this latest rumor. An email to company requesting more details was not immediately returned. And I’m not expecting one.

However, in a recent post on Facebook (FB) tech evangelist Robert Scoble noted that Zeiss employee confirmed rumors that both companies ""are working on a light pair of augmented reality/mixed reality glasses that may be announced this year.”

“AR can be really great, and we have been and continue to invest a lot in this,” Tim Cook said in a July 26 conference call with analysts. “We are high on AR for the long run. We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity.”

In an interview with ABC news last September, Cook — though he stopped short of divulging specific plans — made it clear that augmented reality was his preferred route over virtual reality.

Given Cook’s apparent interest in AR, partnering with Zeiss makes perfect sense. According to tech site Engadget, Zeiss’ strategy for the product is ""to develop these curved lenses and then partner with a technology company that can develop the computing hardware and software.” Given Apple’s ecosystem strengths and its ability to control both the hardware and software, it would be the ideal partner for Zeiss.

In short, while Google Glass, announced in 2012, was likely too advanced for its time, Apple’s AR ambitions seems well timed. That, however, doesn’t guarantee its AR glasses — whatever they will be called — will be a hit. But to the extent Apple can sell the reality of the product and not just seek to capitalize on the hype, it would have already succeeded where Google failed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More recently, the company acquired a controlling interest in Lazada for $1 billion, valuing the Singaporean e-commerce giant at $1.5 billion. In addition to the core e-commerce business, Alibaba has invested significantly in non-commerce businesses such as cloud computing, internet infrastructure, digital media and entertainment. While the online retail and wholesale business continue to grow and generate profits for Alibaba, the company is looking to diversify and look at long-term growth areas. Among these areas of growth, its investment in Indian online payment gateway and e-wallet PayTM could be key for Alibaba in the long run. Below we take a look at the factors driving growth in the space and how Alibaba can gain from this investment.

According to our estimates, the non-commerce businesses make up around 8% of our $88 price estimate for Alibaba's stock . Our price estimate is slightly lower than the current market price.

PayTM As A Lucrative Investment



PayTM is an online payment gateway and e-wallet which was founded in 2010 and has since grown to be one of the largest such companies in India. According to data compiled by the Economic Times, Alibaba and Ant Financial Services Group (formerly Alipay) combined own a 40% stake in PayTM, which is estimated to be worth around $5 billion. Alibaba has invested a total of around $1.5 billion in PayTM at valuations of $800 million and $3.4 billion in the past.

This investment has become even more significant for Alibaba in the wake of the decision by the Indian Government to demonetize 86% of the available currency in circulation in November last year. The move was made by the government in an attempt to promote digital payments instead of cash-based transactions to curb the black market and counterfeit currency in circulation. Subsequently, digital transactions including debit card payments, credit card payments, and e-wallet payments surged by 100% in the month following the announcement. As a result, PayTM observed a 400% surge in traffic, a 200% increase in the total number of app downloads and 1000% growth in money added to e-wallets. In the 10-day period following the news, PayTM added around 20 million users to its total user base. PayTM now has a user base of around 170 million, which is just shy of PayPal's ( PYPL ) 196 million users.

Since it is still in a relatively nascent stage, PayTM's monetization per user is much lower than what PayPal makes per user. PayPal's net revenue for 2015 stood at around $9.2 billion, while PayTM generated around $130 million in revenues for fiscal year ended March 2016. In the long run, however, PayTM's business is likely to pick up significantly given the expected growth in the digital payments market in India. According to a recent report by the Boston Consulting Group, the total market for digital payments in India could grow at a CAGR of almost 60% through 2020 to become a $500 billion market.

Losses Likely To Continue In The Near Term

Alibaba reported segment-wise margins for the first time in the earnings report for the June-ended quarter last year. According to Alibaba's filings, the company's non-commerce segments combined reported an operating loss while the online retail and wholesale businesses reported profits. Alibaba is investing heavily in digital media, cloud computing, online video streaming and other new ventures, banking on long-term growth. With Alibaba's deep pockets and intent to capture a significant chunk of the growing Asian markets, PayTM could be a key strategic investment for the company.

This marks the second project that the Mountain View, Calif.-based company has exited in less than a week.

And that's not the end of it. The company's robot division, Boston Dynamics, is on the block for a sale, while it has also instituted cuts to Google X, the company's division for wild ideas.

Google's moves are a sobering about-turn for a company famous for its moonshots. The decision to rein them in is part of the company's renewed focus on paring down costs after the arrival of former Morgan Stanley CFO Ruth Porat. They are also proof that the company's zeal to reinvent entire industries may have hit a reality roadblock. (See also: How Alphabet Inc. Reworked Its Letters This Year.)

The following is a list of industries that Google has pulled out of or applied the brakes on in the past couple of years.

Augmented Reality (Google Glass)

The augmented reality glasses made a splash when they were first launched back in 2013. The device essentially consisted of a pair of glasses connected to the Internet and fitted with a camera that enabled wearers to browse the net and take photographs at the same time. However, even extravagant photo spreads in fashion magazines could not dim privacy concerns related to the device. They never caught on in mainstream society, and in 2015, Google closed the Explorer program associated with the device.

Broadband (Google Fiber)

Kansas City made headlines in 2011 when it was selected to become the first city to receive Google Fiber. Subsequently, 12 more cities were added to the list of cities with Google's high-speed Internet broadband service. In October last year, the company announced a halting of expansion to new cities and cut down staff for the unit.

Based on reports, the unit was responsible for a majority of the $280 million capital expenditures related in Alphabet's ""Other Bets"" division. But the company’s CFO Ruth Porat reminded investors in a quarterly call that the company still has a broadband presence in 18 cities (in addition to the Webpass acquisition). She said the company was pausing expansion for ""exploratory discussions"" and to ""integrate technology work."" (See also: Google Halts Expansion Of Fiber Project.)

Satellite Imaging (Terra Bella)

When Google bought Skybox Imaging (the division's earlier name) for $500 million in 2014, it wanted to use the startup's technology for Google Maps and to spread Internet access in remote regions of the world. Two years later, however, the company seems to have rethought that mission and is reported to be in talks to sell the division off to a competitor in exchange for an equity stake. (See also: Alphabet in Talks to Sell Satellite Imaging Startup.)

Robotics (Boston Dynamics)

Google acquired Boston Dynamics in 2013 for an undisclosed sum and established a robotics division called Replicant in 2014. It released viral videos about life with robots earlier this year. However, the robotics unit is said to be up for sale after senior executives concluded that the unit will not be making money, at least for the next couple of years. The move also represents a possible end to Google's foray into robotics. According to a Bloomberg report last year, there is no longer a separate robotics division within Google.

Waymo unveiled an improved suite of sensors and said it had slashed the cost of the pivotal technology on Jan 8 at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. So far, Waymo has cut a deal with one carmaker, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, to outfit vehicles with its full self-driving kit, including hardware and software.

In the future, would Waymo sell hardware – like its new, cheaper LiDAR sensors – to other companies?

”Possibly,” John Krafcik, Waymo’s chief executive officer, said in an interview with Bloomberg News on Jan 9.

The strategy would be a departure for the Google parent, which has touted its own complete autonomous vehicles in the past, not specific components. Sensor sales would give Waymo another crack at industry deals. Some carmakers, including Ford Motor Co, have balked during partnership talks over disagreements about data sharing, people familiar with the discussions have said.

Waymo’s decision to build its own sensors, radar and cameras, in addition to software, may increase competition with companies that supply driverless technology to auto manufacturers. Shares of Mobileye NV, which develops systems that model vehicles’ surroundings, fell 4.4% to US$39.86 in New York, their biggest one-day decline since mid-November.

”There is a chance that this development by Google will be considered further progress at a faster rate of change than Mobileye,"" Neil Campling, head of global tech, media and telecom research at Northern Trust Capital Markets, wrote in an e-mail on Monday. “The same could suggest that Google is moving further towards offering end-to-end solutions for the auto OEMs in the AV world and undermining Mobileye’s position.”

Commercial applications

Krafcik, a former Ford executive, described a wide range of commercial applications for the autonomous system. “You can count on Waymo being engaged in a lot of these areas, from logistics, to ride-sharing, to personal use licensing working with OEMs, to last-mile public transport solutions,” he said.

He declined to give details on the revenue model. Bloomberg News has reported that Waymo plans to start a ride-hailing service later this year, relying on Fiat Chrysler minivans.

In an earlier interview in Detroit, Sergio Marchionne, CEO of Fiat Chrysler, stressed that his company is a full-fledged partner with Alphabet, not simply a suppler. “We’re not losing money,” he said of the Waymo arrangement. “But it’s not something that changes our profit targets.”

The chief of the Italian-American automaker also confirmed an earlier Bloomberg News report that Chrysler will at least double the number of Pacifica minivans it is providing to Waymo.

Honda Mobility

Krafcik declined to offer more details on the Fiat Chrysler partnership. But he did address a possible deal with Honda Motor Co.

”There’s just a really strong philosophical alignment between the two companies,” Krafcik said. “Honda represents Japan and a very aging society where there are a lot of mobility concerns. And a big part of our message has not just been safety but also mobility.”

Waymo, which formed as a new Alphabet business in December, is one of the youngest companies in Detroit for the auto show this week. But it has worked on driverless technology for almost a decade. It’s now gearing up for a commercial launch after losing a cadre of early engineers this summer.

Krafcik declined to give a timeline for a launch, but suggested the wait would not be a long one. “Sooner than you think,” he said. — Bloomberg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is making good progress into a diversified business -- but it also faces one very large risk.First, the company revealed how serious it's getting about self-driving cars, moving it from moonshot status to full blown company status in our CML Pro dossier: It's Time to Focus on Google In that dossier we note that Alphabet Inc created a new company under its umbrella called Waymo. Alphabet Inc teamed up with Fiat Chrysler to put its self-driving technology in a 100 Chrysler minivans. This serves as both a test for the self-driving car technology, and the earliest part of a potential blockbuster deal. Then we got this:As we wrote in that dossier:""It was lost in the wind of headlines, but Alphabet has already started talks with General Motors and Ford as well. Now, imagine for a moment that the self-driving revolution, which is coming much sooner than Wall Street understands, is driven by Alphabet's technology.Yeah, Tesla will have their cars, and likely Apple as well, but Chrysler, Honda and possibly other manufacturers partnering with Alphabet Inc could mean a leader has already been established.Let Tesla sell its 500,000 cars by 2018 if they can. Alphabet is looking to sell tens of millions within five years, with no cost of production, no assembly line, no radical new business - just the best technology in the world licensed to the largest auto makers in the world.""That was actually review, here is the new information we learned:But that was the distraction. The real news is that Alphabet is finally going after Uber. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is going to use the semi-autonomous Chrysler Pacifica fleet as a ride-hailing service. Waymo's next move is going to be to let people ""use our vehicles to do everyday things like run errands, commute to work, or get safely home after a night on the town.""That new build out with Fiat Chrysler looks like it's actually going to happen. But we got even more news from Google last week: The company has rolled out a new retail partnership with BMW and the Gap to deploy its 3-D-scanning project called 'Tango'.The idea here is virtual shopping as a replacement or addition to 'real' shopping. The vision is pretty clear with automobiles and it's nice to see Google going further with standard retail. ""A new app allows shoppers to test clothes from the Gap brand using Tango.""There are limited audiences for this technology right now, but looking to the future is always the right move for technology.This business, the self-driving car business, along with a possible new line with the Google Pixel smartphone, which we wrote about in our dossier Wall Street is Blind to Google's Upside Potential is finally giving us an eye to Alphabet's broader diversification strategy.But there is risk to Alphabet Inc -- one that's growing and one that is existential.(1) Google is losing a sizable piece of its business to Amazon in one particular area: e-commerce search, according to Eugene Kim of Business Insider.(2) Google better straighten out the 'fake news' phenomenon. As I stated ever so clearly on CBC with Peter Armstrong, if Google Search is no longer a trusted source of content, Google is dead. Of course, that's a radical take on it -- we just note that the company better make strides here, and we believe they will.Here is that interview for convenience (link on MSN Money) Alphabet remains aTop Pick and we remain bullish on the company long-term. We love the new progress and praise the company for finally turning new ideas into new businesses.We promised we would include more option content in our dossiers, so here is a nice piece on Alphabet Inc.Staying bullish here, we examined selling put spreads in GOOGL over a three-year period every month. During this time frame the stock has risen 42.7%. The put spreads, well, they did a lot better:And here is the option strategy highlighted in yellow versus the stock in gray:We discovered this ever so easily on the CML Trade Machine option back-tester with three clicks of the mouse.

A More Streamlined Google Stock (GOOG)

Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is reportedly trying to sell one of its satellite divisions, a business that it bought in 2014 for $500.0 million. This sale would suggest Alphabet’s upper management is getting serious about cost-cutting, and that they are willing to do the dirty work needed to ensure a bright future for Google stock (GOOG).

A competing satellite-imagery firm named Planet Labs Inc. wants to take the business off Alphabet’s hands, but it is still a small startup.

The hope is that it can raise enough money to complete a “cash plus equity deal,” which would suggest that Alphabet will retain some stake in the enterprise even after selling it. (Source: “Google in Talks to Sell Its Satellite Business,” The Wall Street Journal, January 10, 2017.)

But the important point to remember is that any associated costs will get wiped off the company’s income statement. That is a really big deal for Google stock, not because this satellite business was terrible or anything, but because it shows commitment to shareholder value.

For as long as I can remember, Google has thrown money around without a second thought. To be fair, its monopoly over the search engine market was so absolute that it could afford to do that. As the online advertising business grew bigger, GOOG stock continued to rise.

This was the basic equation that propelled Google stock over the last decade and a half.

The internet behemoth managed to stay atop the tech world by playing the odds. It would invest in a bunch of interesting new technologies with the hopes that one or two of them would eventually become a product. That’s how “Android,” “Maps,” and the “Chromecast” came into existence.

But now it’s time for a little belt-tightening. In order to keep Google stock moving “up and to the right” there needs to be more money-makers and fewer science projects. If you take a close look at what Alphabet has been doing over the last year, it’s pretty clear that it’s making the right moves.

For instance, it spun the driverless car project into a full-fledged business called “Waymo” (yes, I know it’s a terrible name, but it could be a golden goose) and unveiled a fleet of self-driving minivans. (Source: “A first look at our Waymo fully self-driving Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans,” Medium, December 18, 2016.)

Since Waymo isn’t manufacturing the cars, but simply licensing the technology to carmakers like Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE:FCAU) or Toyota Motor Corp (ADR) (NYSE:TM), it could become a profit center much sooner than other firms in the same industry.

We’re talking billions of dollars here. Put that in perspective with the imminent sale of Alphabet’s satellite-imagery business. What you’ll see is a company that is focused, a company that is slashing unnecessary costs and cranking up its earning potential.

From a fundamentals perspective, this would suggest that Google stock is grossly underrated. We expect the share price to explode this year, particularly in the third and fourth quarters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is just a few weeks away from its next earnings report. And thanks to a lot of news in the past several months, it could result in a big move for AAPL stock.

Last quarter, the tech company recorded its first year-over-year revenue decline since 2001. Those Apple earnings results were expected, of course, but still not easy to swallow. Furthermore, profits barely met expectations.

However, management didn't only have bad news to share with AAPL stock holders. Forward guidance at the end of 2016 was very strong, both for sales and margins, and that could mean a big turnaround is in order when the next Apple earnings report drops.

There are merits to either side of the trade, but should you buy Apple Inc. here or sell the company right now? Here are three pros and three cons to help you decide:

Pros of AAPL Stock

Value Play: For all the talk about the end of Apple's go-go growth, it's important to acknowledge the company has matured and evolved into a strong value play. Right now the stock trades for just under 12 times future earnings, well under the forward price-earnings ratio of about 19 for the S&P 500 or Nasdaq indices.

Cash King: By the way, that forward P/E of 11 doesn't back out the copious cash Apple Inc. is sitting on. Right now the tally is roughly $220 billion, give or take, or about a third of its market cap. If you don't think some of that money is accessible thanks to repatriation issues, then consider the more than $50 billion in annual free cash flow. That's plenty of dry powder right there.

Return of Capital: At its current perch of $119, AAPL stock yields a decent 1.9%. It also executed $29 billion worth of stock buybacks in the prior four quarters. Between these dividends and buybacks, Apple Inc. has returned more than $186 billion in capital to shareholders since 2012.

Cons of AAPL Stock

iPhone Overreliance: Part of the reason growth has slowed for Apple stock lately is because it is heavily reliant on its iconic iPhone to generate revenue. Right now, the device still accounts for about two-thirds of the top line, so it's very difficult to imagine AAPL stock moving higher as this core part of its business decays or flatlines.

Stuck in a Rut: Shares have been bouncing around lately, but longer-term have remained range bound between $100 and $120 a share since late 2014. Sure, if you bought AAPL stock at $100 and unloaded at $120 that's a nice 20% profit … but shares are now at the upper bounds of that range again and that could mean a rocky road lies ahead.

Tech Is Unforgiving: There's always a lot of lip service paid to ""innovative"" companies with a history of ""disruption,"" but history shows it is quite rare for a once-dominant large-cap tech company to regain its former glory after it stumbles. Whether you're talking about Cisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO ), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) or recently acquired Yahoo Inc , it's clear that once these big players take a breather, newer and hungrier companies tend to step in and fill the space. Be careful before you assume AAPL stock is any different.

A perfect storm of Donald Trump's surprise election, encouraging jobs data and the usual holiday optimism on Wall Street have spurred stocks to new heights over the past two months. But Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) stock has been conspicuous in its absence from the recent rally.

Source: Shutterstock

The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq have each risen more than 6% since Trump was elected. Amazon stock is up a mere 1.5%, and that's all in the past week.

I think that post-New Year's bump is only the beginning of a long overdue rally in Amazon stock. Here are three reasons why.

The Holidays Were Good to Amazon.com

The shift in consumer shopping from big-box stores to the web continued this holiday season, and no company benefits more from that shift than Amazon. Sales improved 11% over last year's holiday season, and AMZN transactions accounted for a whopping 38% of all online sales - Best Buy Co Inc (NYSE: BBY ) ranked second with 4%.

That bodes well for Amazon's fourth-quarter sales, due for release on Jan. 26. After the company missed earnings by a wide margin in the third quarter, AMZN stock nosedived nearly 14% in three weeks. It has taken another six weeks for the stock to recover. Speaking of which …

Amazon Stock Just Broke Through a Big Technical Barrier

I tend to like stocks to prove themselves before I recommend them. To me, bottom-buying is little more than guess work. A week ago, Amazon stock was stuck in the mud. Now it's proving itself again. AMZN just broke above its 50-day moving average for the first time since the late-October earnings miss, and was up nearly 40 points in two trading sessions.

Praise for Amazon's Alexa presentation at this week's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas was one catalyst; beginning-of-the-year buying of slumping growth stocks appears to be another, as Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ) (which combined with Amazon comprise the so-called ""FANG"" stocks) have all built up a full head of steam since the calendar flipped to 2017.

If AMZN beats earnings in two weeks, look for more bulls to swoop in and push the stock well into the $800s.

Drones, Groceries and Sports Apparel

What makes Amazon such a good company - and AMZN such a hard stock to keep down for long - is its diversification and wow factor. Jeff Bezos is never short on ideas for a new revenue stream, and the past few weeks have illustrated that.

In December, the company unveiled its first Amazon Go, a grocery store without cashiers or checkout lines; it made its first-ever (and long-promised) drone delivery, in England; and it hinted at plans to launch its own athleisure line, with the intent to compete with Lululemon Athletica inc. (NASDAQ: LULU ).

And that was all before Alexa was reportedly the toast of last week's Consumer Electronics Show, as both Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F ) and Volkswagen AG (ADR) (OTCMKTS: VLKAY ) announced plans to include the virtual voice assistant as part of their infotainment systems in new cars.

The Alexa-automakers partnership alone helped move the needle for Amazon stock this week, a sign that AMZN buyers are back. With no shortage of innovative catalysts on the horizon, look for the recent mini-rally in Amazon stock to pick up steam in the coming weeks and months.

Whether you're a long-term investor or a trader looking to make a quick profit, I'd snatch up AMZN now.

In a research note to investors Tuesday, Cowen analyst John Blackledge, citing continued strength in Google’s search business combined with a dominant position in YouTube amid secular transition to digital video advertising, issued a $1,050 price target on GOOGL stock. Blackledge, who was already a GOOGL bull with a $1,000 target, maintained an Outperform rating.

Alphabet shares closed Tuesday at $826.01, down a fraction. The stock has already risen 4.17% year to date, besting the 1.4% risen in the S&P 500 Index. But over the past year, Alphabet’s 13% rise has trailed the S&P 500 Index’s 18% gain. Blackledge’s $1,050 price target, however, calls for Alphabet to deliver additional premiums of almost 30%. And the company’s strong advertising prowess will be the main driver.

“Overall, results point to search being an enduring franchise and YouTube's ascension in video as a primary platform for new branding initiatives,” Blackledge said in his note Tuesday. “Our brand focused respondents still acknowledged that GOOG Search offers the highest ROI [return on investment], which we think aptly demonstrates the moat around GOOG’s core business,” the analyst explained.

It’s hard to imagine Blackledge’s optimism could still be underestimating Google’s potential. According to research firm eMarketer, Google will rake in more than $42 billion in mobile internet ad revenues in 2017, which would be about 41% higher than Facebook’s (FB) expected total of $30 billion. What’s more, Google’s mobile internet ad revenue for 2018 is expected to grow by around 15%, reaching north of $48 billion.

Both Google and Facebook combined get about 85 cents of every dollar spent on online advertising. And in the case of Google, which has struggled to grow its mobile business, the company has begun to figure it out. The fact that third quarter mobile ad revenue reached $22.45 billion, climbing 23% year-over-year, makes Google an even bigger advertising force to be reckoned with.

And when factoring the strength of YouTube, which Blackledge noted is generating robust daily viewership in the “hundreds of millions of hours,” $1,050 price target suddenly seems like a discount. From a valuation perspective, GOOGL stock is priced at 20 times fiscal 2017 estimates of $41.08 per share. While that might not seem like a bargain, compared to the 18 P/E of the S&P 500 Index, the company is growing EPS 19% for 2017.

Bottom line: You’ve got a dominant advertising behemoth with virtually no competition that is growing earnings at almost 20% annual rate that has $80 billion in net cash on the balance sheet with another $33 billion in operating cash flow. What would you pay for that business? The rate of Alphabet’s revenue and earnings growth should command a higher multiple of 26, not 20, which puts the stock, yes, right around $1,050.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Before the numbers for the quarter are released, here's a broad overview of some areas to watch.

Google offices. Image souce: Google.

Revenue and EPS

The pressure is certainly on for Alphabet's fourth quarter, especially after the company's expectation-beating quarter before it. For Alphabet's third quarter, both the company's revenue and earnings per share (EPS) exceeded expectations. Revenue and non-GAAP (non-generally accepted accounting principles) EPS was $22.5 billion and $9.06, respectively, up significantly from $18.7 billion and $7.35, respectively, in the year-ago quarter. Analysts, on average, expected third-quarter revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $22.1 billion and $8.63.

Going into Alphabet's fourth quarter, analysts expect robust growth to continue, albeit not as sharply. On average, analysts expect fourth-quarter revenue and EPS of $25.1 billion and $9.63, up 18% and 11%, respectively, year over year.

Metric Q3 YOY Growth Q3 YOY Growth Implied by Consensus Analyst Estimate Revenue 20% 18% Non-GAAP EPS 23% 11%

There's merit to analysts' conservatism, particularly since Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat went out of her way during the company's third-quarter earnings call to remind analysts that the company will be up against tough year-ago revenue comparisons in the fourth quarter.

Paid clicks and cost-per-clicks

One of the reasons why Alphabet outperformed expectations in Q3 was because of its big increase in paid clicks, or the total number of clicks for which advertisers paid Google. Aggregate paid clicks in Q3 were up 9% sequentially and 33% year over year. Notably, some of the benefits from such a large increase in paid clicks was offset by 5% and 11% decreases in cost-per-click, or the amount advertisers pay Alphabet for each click, but the outsized gain in paid clicks was significant enough to help drive significant revenue growth.

Investors should look for look for similar trends in Alphabet's paid clicks and cost-per-clicks in Q4. If the trends diverge in an unexpected direction, investors may want to look for an explanation from management during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call.

New Google products

Also, after launching some new Google-branded hardware, investors also may want to look for some updates from management on how these products are faring. While the new products still almost certainly will be immaterial to overall results, a promising start for the new devices could signal bigger opportunity ahead.

Google Home. Image source: Google.

In October, Alphabet launched two new significant products: a Google Pixel smartphone and a Google Home artificial intelligence-enabled smart speaker. The Pixel quickly sold out online, and Google Home ended up selling out in many stores during the holidays -- evidence of the high demand for these new products. Indeed, in a statement to 9to5Google, a Google spokesperson specifically said demand was to blame for the Pixel selling out:

We're thrilled to see the excitement for our new Pixel phones, and frankly pre-order demand has exceeded our expectations. We're working to restock our inventory as soon as possible.

While Alphabet hasn't yet proven it can build a sustainable and meaningful hardware business, maybe the Pixel smartphone and Google Home could finally change this.

Alphabet will report its fourth-quarter results immediately after market close on Jan. 26. Management will host a conference call to discuss the results at 4:30 p.m. EST.

Genius is a funny thing - we often don't recognize nor appreciate it until it's gone. Case in point is Nikola Tesla. The innovative scientist - from whom Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ) gets its name - was on a path toward inventing a free global power generator when he discovered the ""Tesla coil.""

Source: Shutterstock

This system was the first one where electricity could be transmitted wirelessly . Although Tesla never achieved his dream of providing free energy, his groundbreaking work set the stage for today's technologies.

Indeed, while Wall Street has clamored over Tesla stock in recent years, many would be surprised to learn that TSLA did not invent the electric vehicle. In fact, the very first EV was developed well before TSLA CEO Elon Musk - or even his parents - were born. The first crude prototypes were introduced during the early nineteenth century. However, it wasn't until the 1890s that the EV entered its original heyday.

The Backdrop of Tesla stock

In 1893, electric-powered cars were exhibited in Chicago. Four years later, electric taxis were ferrying people around busy New York City streets. By the dawn of the twentieth century, EVs were actually on the verge of automotive domination. In 1900, a whopping 28% of automobiles were powered by electricity. A year earlier, Thomas Edison of General Electric Company (NYSE: GE ) fame began a massive investment into EV battery technologies.

Of course, it was Henry Ford and the eventual Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F ) that killed the EV's momentum. Mass production of the iconic Model T offered the public practical transportation at a substantial discount to its electric counterparts. As further advancements made gasoline-powered cars increasingly convenient, the EV platform was quickly abandoned, and not to be revisited seriously until TSLA entered the scene.

The eventual success of Tesla stock resulted from a primary vulnerability of fossil-fueled autos - dependence on crude oil. That not only drew the ire of price-gouged drivers, it also directly shed human blood. World wars have been fought over oil . And it's absolutely no conspiracy to say that much of our foreign policy is centered on ""black gold.""

I'm not suggesting that Tesla stock is some kind of philanthropic investment. Rather, TSLA is an investment in the future that has been a long-time coming. Anybody that's anybody - Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , GOOGL ), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Amazon.com, Inc . (NASDAQ: AMZN ) - are all gearing up aggressively for digitization and ""next-gen"" computing. To assume that our transportation mechanisms will continue to be tethered to archaic fossil fuels is to believe in the flat earth.

I would go so far as to say that the bear case for Tesla stock should only be limited to a clearly defined framework. Otherwise, TSLA is one of the few investments I confidently trust.

Fears Surrounding Tesla's Viability

That's not to say that Tesla isn't without faults. From a gut reaction, shares are pricey. After all, Tesla stock was trading for around $30 a pop four years ago. At well over $200 today, that's a big percentage and psychological jump. Naturally, investors will question whether they've missed the boat.



Click to Enlarge Drawing up a long-term technical chart of Tesla stock does not help matters. When assessing the publicly traded history of TSLA stock, you can't help but notice a sharp resemblance to the business S-curve .

In short, the S-curve is a graphical representation of the three main phases of a business or industry - infancy, expansion and maturity. The concern here is that Tesla stock has gone through an accelerated version of the S-curve, and is now sitting in the maturity phase.

Adding to those fears are the financials. Let's be honest - they don't look great. Free cash flow is always running in the red, profitability margins are stressed and Tesla stock is overvalued against forward earnings. Short interest for TSLA stock has also increased significantly since the second-half of this year.

Finally, as awesome as these folks are, they're not immune to making dumb mistakes . The buyout of SolarCity is an embarrassing example.

Moving Forward With Tesla Stock

Listen - Tesla stock isn't for everybody. But I'd like to leave you with this last statistic. Presently, everyone is talking about the EV revolution - which TSLA helped catapult - as if it's unprecedented. Yet the market penetration for EVs is only 3%. The mass excitement centers around forecasts calling for 7% penetration by the year 2020.

That's nice, but that's just scratching the surface. Assuming the forecast is accurate, that's only a quarter of what was achieved in 1900. With technology advancing at a clip rate, it's more likely than not that TSLA will end up on the right side of history.

The bottom line here is to not let the bumps in the road dissuade you from Tesla stock. It's risky, it's pricey, but it has all the right components working in its favor.

As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

(RTTNews.com) - Google parent Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOGL, GOOG) X research lab had shut down its Titan Drone Internet Project. This happened in early 2016.

In 2014, Google and Facebook Inc. vied to acquire Titan Aerospace, a maker of high-altitude, solar-powered drones. Google won the bidding, so Facebook purchased its own company, which was building a huge glider called Aquila. The idea was to beam internet access from the sky to get more people logging on from remote places to access information and probably use both companies' web services.

The team from Titan was brought into X in late 2015, and the research lab ended its exploration of high-altitude drones for internet access.

You win some, you lose some.

Kantar has released its most recent estimates on numerous smartphone markets around the world, covering the three months ending November 2016 before the holiday shopping season picked up steam. Well, the news is mixed. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) was able to chip away at Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) lead in key geographies in Europe as well as the U.S., but continued to slip in greater China, where local manufacturers are flooding the market with low-cost Android devices.

Let's dig through the numbers.

The good

The iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, and iPhone 6s were the top three handsets within the U.S. for the period, grabbing a combined 31% market share. Samsung's Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge came in at the No. 4 and No. 5 spots and accounted for 29% of sales. Aggressive carrier promotions helped both the Mac maker and the South Korean conglomerate, as all the domestic carriers had various promotions to get a free flagship devices. Overall, iOS grew within the U.S. by 6.4 percentage points to grab a 43.5% market share.

Interestingly, Google's decision to partner with Verizon as the exclusive carrier distributing the Pixel seems to be paying off, with the Pixel comprising about 1.3% of all smartphone sales; over half of those new phones were activated at Big Red. That may not sound like a whole lot, but it's actually impressive when you consider that Nexus and Pixel phones have never been high-volume devices, so 1.3% is actually pretty good within that context.

In Europe, Apple did particularly well within the U.K., where it saw its market share jump 9.1 percentage points, and now has a 48.3% share in the country. iOS also jumped by 6.5 percentage points in France to a 24.5% market share. In the broader EU5 (Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and the U.K.), Apple had 24.6% share of all smartphone sales.

The bad

Apple has seen its position in China deteriorate over the past year or so, while local players have been able to rise and chip away at both Apple and larger Android original equipment manufacturers. Android now accounts for 80% of smartphones sold in the Middle Kingdom, which is the largest smartphone market in the world. iOS fell from 25.3% of urban China to just 19.9%, although Apple was up modestly on a sequential basis. The only silver lining here is that the iPhone 7 was the single best-selling device in urban China, grabbing 6.6% of all sales.

The problem is that there are so many other low-cost Android choices out there that make up the rest of the market (Huawei and Oppo now represent nearly 40% of the market). Apple's business in China is still on a long-term upward trajectory and I have little doubt that the company will recover, but it's definitely seen better days.

Apple Stock (AAPL Stock) Is Looking Forward to a Game Changer

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has been gaining ground of late, and AAPL stock is trading at around $119.00-plus levels now. As the company and its fans celebrate the 10th anniversary of the iconic “iPhone,” it is the right time to ponder what lies ahead for the company that has been defined by its smartphone.

There seems to be a clear problem ahead for the company, which was conspicuous by its absence from the Consumer Electronics Show (CES 2017) trade show in Las Vegas.

This problem has been mentioned in a report from The Wall Street Journal, which explains how the company seems to be lagging behind in executing its vision for artificial intelligence (AI), specifically voice-based interfaces. (Source: “Why Apple’s Critics Are Right This Time,” The Wall Street Journal, January 8, 2017.)

AI is important to the company, as this technology is most likely to disrupt Apple the same way that Apple disrupted the smartphone industry. AAPL stock has been riding high for too long on the phenomenal success of the iPhone.

AI-powered voice assistants are capable of replacing interactions with mobile devices. It does not mean that screens will not be needed anymore. However, users will become more inclined to talk to objects that can listen and interact with them. This is what is behind the success of Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) voice-based assistant “Alexa.”

Apple appears to be way behind in this race, and this is not good for Apple stock going forward. Amazon’s Alexa was a huge hit at the just-concluded CES 2017. At that trade show, a number of companies announced their devices that would be powered by Alexa.

Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) has also launched its “Pixel” smartphone that has “Google Assistant” running the show. Alphabet executives were also there at the CES 2017 tech show, where they unveiled a number of devices that would be run on with Google Assistant. AAPL stock came under pressure last year when the Pixel got better reviews than Apple’s “iPhone 7.”

The Challenge for Apple Stock in 2017

Contrast this with the way things have been running at Apple Inc. on the AI front. Apple’s “Siri” has been around for a longer time, but still could never grab the attention that its competitors have been able to command. The company has been on an acquisition spree to strengthen its presence in AI but still does not have a serious contender to Amazon, Alphabet, or even Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).

As investors look forward to the quarterly results of Apple Inc., the whole focus will be on what plans that management has to keep itself ahead in the consumer technology space. AAPL stock is unlikely to grow much under the shadow of the iPhone now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Google won the bidding, so Facebook purchased its own company, which was building a huge glider called Aquila.

The idea was to beam internet access from the sky to get more people logging on from remote places to access information and probably use both companies’ web services. That soaring vision has come down to Earth with a bump.

On Wednesday, a spokeswoman from Google parent Alphabet Inc.’s X research lab said it had shut down Titan. This happened in early 2016, she said, although confirmation didn’t come until earlier today, when technology blog 9to5Google reported the move.

The team from Titan was brought into X in late 2015, and the research lab ended its exploration of high-altitude drones for internet access shortly after, the X spokeswoman said in a statement.

Facebook has also struggled. Its Aquila drone crashed during a test flight in June, sparking an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board. That was the latest hiccup in Facebook’s plans to wirelessly connect the world, following an explosion earlier in 2016 that destroyed one of its satellites and political resistance to its free services in India.

Alphabet canceled Titan because of economic and technical challenges. Project Loon, another X project to beam internet from high-altitude balloons, is still going. So is Project Wing, an effort to use drones for deliveries, rather than internet service.

""By comparison, at this stage the economics and technical feasibility of Project Loon present a much more promising way to connect rural and remote parts of the world,"" the X spokeswoman said on Wednesday. ""Many people from the Titan team are now using their expertise as part of other high flying projects at X, including Loon and Project Wing.""

Project Wing is facing its own challenges. In the fall of 2016, several Wing employees were asked to find other projects at Alphabet after X pulled back on some of its drone delivery plans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1/11/2017,0.419712644,0.022241379,805,808.15,801.37,807.91,1065936,6.78,2.91,1,"Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is reportedly selling its Terra Bella Imaging satellite business to Planet Labs, one of Terra Bella’s fiercest competitors. For the past year, Alphabet has outperformed the Zacks Internet-Services industry. GOOGL has returned 12.68% compared with the industry’s return of 11.89%.

Bloomberg reported on Monday that the sale is likely an equity transaction with Alphabet keeping a stake in Planet Labs.

Formerly known as Skybox, the earth imaging company was founded in 2009 and the search giant bought it for $500 million in 2014, the same year when Skybox was named no. 1 on Inc. magazine’s 25 Most Audacious Companies.

Getting Rid of Audacious Ventures

The move underscores Alphabet’s efforts to trim relatively less-revenue generating businesses and attain financial discipline.

In Aug 2015, Alphabet reportedly curbed expansion of its high-speed fiber optic Internet network, cutting 9% of its staff. In November, the company scaled back Project Wing, its experimental drone delivery program.

What’s on Planet’s Platter?

Privately held Planet operates with dozens of small satellites that take pictures of the Earth surface frequently. However, the resolution of the images is low. Terra Bella has larger satellites with high image resolution but its fleet contains only seven satellites, which limits the frequency of capturing images.

Thus, we believe that through this acquisition, Planet Labs will add high resolution satellites to its fleet. Both companies share the satellite imaging space with giants like Airbus’ (OTCMKTS: EADSY ) Airbus Defence & Space and DigitalGlobe Inc (NYSE: DGI ).

Key Takeaways

Alphabet’s sales, marketing and R&D expenses have gone up considerably in the last five years. There are also some other margin pressures. The most significant at the moment is related to currency, which continued to impact Alphabet’s results despite the fact that it has a hedging program in place.

Alphabet Inc. EPS Diluted (TTM)

Other expense pressures include fast-paced international growth, a growing volume of lower-priced YouTube clicks and strength of the mobile platform. So we believe that Alphabet has foreseen an escalation of costs in the years to come and is gearing up well in advance with decisions like these.

There’s a good chance that Search is at the top of your list. After all, its former namesake search site has been driving the cash flows and profits at GOOGL stock for years. Especially since it has data-mined those results to sell plenty of ads and generate significant advertising revenues.

Source: Google

But Google isn’t a one-trick pony.

Like rivals such as Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), GOOGL has become one heck of a device and products maker. And while it’s easy to dismiss these gadgets as “hobby business” or non-core operations, the reality is, they are paramount to Google’s underlying mission and business.

In the end, device growth — and what Google does with those devices — is the real driver for GOOGL stock.

Over 157 Products at Google

In total, GOOGL makes over 157 different products for customers. And while the vast bulk of them are Web-based applications — Gmail, Maps, Chrome, etc. — the firm has continued to plow some big-time dollars onto the physical device market.

That may make GOOGL investors a tad bit nervous considering how poorly of an investment Motorola turned out to be for Google. If you remember, GOOGL paid more than $12 billion for the cellphone manufacturer, only to sell it at steep $10 billion loss a few years later. But what Google kept in the sale — some valuable technology patents and applications — is what is going to drive Alphabet’s dominance over the device market.

In recent months, Alphabet has launched new home artificial intelligence equipment, smartphones, virtual reality headsets and home WiFi units. These products join GOOGL’s cadre of Nest WiFi-enabled thermostats and home automation products, Chromebooks and tablets. You name it.

And while many of these items are very impressive in their technology and have caught on with consumers — Nest and its Pixel phones in particular — none of these devices have become huge money makers for Alphabet. Revenues for Google’s physical tools are pretty non-existent and in some products, are actually losses.

So why would Google want even to dabble in device market? It seems that it should just be focusing on ways to continue generating ad sales from is core search operations. But building out ad sales is exactly what GOOGL is doing. To understand why we just need to look at one of its competitors.

Big Data Opportunity for GOOGL Stock

Amazon’s Fire Tablet and new Echo home device aren’t really about making your life easier — it’s about selling you that next movie or book. It’s a way to distribute Amazon’s content and products. In all of this, Amazon is collecting tons of data on your preferences — by what you click and say — to sell you more items down the road.

And that is exactly what GOOGL is doing.

If you’re not searching for something or checking your email, Google has no idea what you’re up to. But slap a home automation device on your wall, smartwatch on your wrist and AI chip in your car, and suddenly Big Brother knows what you’re all about. And in that data collection is where Alphabet is going to thrive.

Before the numbers for the quarter are released, here's a broad overview of some areas to watch.

Revenue and EPS

The pressure is certainly on for Alphabet's fourth quarter, especially after the company's expectation-beating quarter before it. For Alphabet's third quarter, both the company's revenue and earnings per share (EPS) exceeded expectations. Revenue and non-GAAP (non-generally accepted accounting principles) EPS was $22.5 billion and $9.06, respectively, up significantly from $18.7 billion and $7.35, respectively, in the year-ago quarter. Analysts, on average, expected third-quarter revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $22.1 billion and $8.63.

Going into Alphabet's fourth quarter, analysts expect robust growth to continue, albeit not as sharply. On average, analysts expect fourth-quarter revenue and EPS of $25.1 billion and $9.63, up 18% and 11%, respectively, year over year.

Metric Q3 YOY Growth Q3 YOY Growth Implied by Consensus Analyst Estimate Revenue 20% 18% Non-GAAP EPS 23% 11%

There's merit to analysts' conservatism, particularly since Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat went out of her way during the company's third-quarter earnings call to remind analysts that the company will be up against tough year-ago revenue comparisons in the fourth quarter.

Paid clicks and cost-per-clicks

One of the reasons why Alphabet outperformed expectations in Q3 was because of its big increase in paid clicks, or the total number of clicks for which advertisers paid Google. Aggregate paid clicks in Q3 were up 9% sequentially and 33% year over year. Notably, some of the benefits from such a large increase in paid clicks was offset by 5% and 11% decreases in cost-per-click, or the amount advertisers pay Alphabet for each click, but the outsized gain in paid clicks was significant enough to help drive significant revenue growth.

Investors should look for look for similar trends in Alphabet's paid clicks and cost-per-clicks in Q4. If the trends diverge in an unexpected direction, investors may want to look for an explanation from management during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call.

New Google products

Also, after launching some new Google-branded hardware, investors also may want to look for some updates from management on how these products are faring. While the new products still almost certainly will be immaterial to overall results, a promising start for the new devices could signal bigger opportunity ahead.

In October, Alphabet launched two new significant products: a Google Pixel smartphone and a Google Home artificial intelligence-enabled smart speaker. The Pixel quickly sold out online, and Google Home ended up selling out in many stores during the holidays -- evidence of the high demand for these new products. Indeed, in a statement to 9to5Google, a Google spokesperson specifically said demand was to blame for the Pixel selling out:

We're thrilled to see the excitement for our new Pixel phones, and frankly pre-order demand has exceeded our expectations. We're working to restock our inventory as soon as possible.

While Alphabet hasn't yet proven it can build a sustainable and meaningful hardware business, maybe the Pixel smartphone and Google Home could finally change this.

Alphabet will report its fourth-quarter results immediately after market close on Jan. 26. Management will host a conference call to discuss the results at 4:30 p.m. EST.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After just a few, short months of availability on store shelves and at the Google Store , the young platform has added a handful of new apps to keep you entertained, like Netflix VR and HBO Now VR.

Previously, you needed either the Pixel or Pixel XL smartphones to use Daydream View, but now the Moto Z and Moto Z Force support the VR platform. The list of compatible phones is still short, but 2017 has already seen a few models added to the list.

Original article follows below.

Daydream is Google's latest attempt at bringing VR to mobile devices, and it's quite different than Google Cardboard , to say the least.

Unlike Google's somewhat-disposable VR headset, which aimed to get people in the VR door with a low cost and lenient power requirements, Daydream is a more robust vision that has its sight set on providing higher-quality experiences to Android Nougat users.

Daydream will bring even more exciting and absorbing VR experiences to those who can't afford a HTC Vive or Oculus Rift. Here's everything you need to know about it.

Cut to the chase

What is it? Google's next mobile VR platform

Google's next mobile VR platform When is it out? Now

Now What will it cost? $79 (£69, about AU$104)

Daydream View headset

Want to get started with Daydream? Google has its own headset that you'll be able to use with Daydream-ready phones. It's called Daydream View and unlike other VR headsets we've seen before it has a material design...just like its operating system. There's a latch on the front to slide your phone in and the controller for the headset is included.

Thankfully, Google hasn't locked down control of the Daydream formula, and is inviting other OEMs to create their own Daydream headsets. Huawei has stepped up first by announcing that its Huawei VR headset will support the Huawei Mate 9 Pro, which was added recently to the list of Daydream-ready phones.

Google Daydream release date

Google Daydream is baked into the OS on the Pixel, Pixel XL, as well as a few of the latest Moto Z devices.

Google has also confirmed Samsung, Alcatel, Asus, HTC, LG, Xiaomi and ZTE will produce phones that are ""Daydream ready."" Huawei also confirmed it would be making Daydream-ready phones, headsets and controllers.

The ZTE Axon 7 is the first smartphone announced to be Google Daydream-compatible along with its very-own VR headset, the ZTE VR. It just needs Android Nougat and Google's necessary VR maintenance software update to pull it off, which will come in the Android Nougat 7.1 update. Funny enough, we're still waiting on this update to land for ZTE's recent device.

What can it do?

Google Daydream will run apps and games downloaded from the Play Store making it easy to find experiences to use on your headset. According to Google, by the end of 2016 there will be over 50 apps and games available on the platform.

That includes a Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them tie-in experience as well as an app called Star Chart that allows you to explore the solar system as you look around. Google also showed off a shooter game from the makers of EVE called GunJack 2.

Netflix, HBO and Hulu will all have Daydream ready apps in the coming months, plus The New York Times will launch an app too for its VR videos.

Plus, Google will also make its own apps compatible with the Daydream platform. It's including Play Movies, Photos, Maps and YouTube when the platform launches.

Unity and Epic also announced development support for Daydream on the gaming side of things. Here's some early footage of a Daydream prototype developed my Epic.

Design

The Daydream View headset shown off by Google is only one option for Daydream VR. It's also letting other companies take hold of the tech, which will likely result in a variety of different looking headsets.

Google has divvied out a few details about its controller, which resembles a Wii remote, and shares some common physical traits from the latest Apple TV touch remote.

On its top, it will feature a clickable touch pad to bring native touchscreen-like gestures to the virtual world. Next down, there is an app button that will put your (you guessed it) apps within view. Lastly, the home button will return you to the home screen of Daydream.

There's also an entire user interface within Daydream that's ripe for discussion.

The Daydream hub looks refined and quite similar (OK, almost exactly the same) to the Oculus Home found within the Oculus Rift and Samsung Gear VR. You'll use the motion controller to navigate the menus and swap between apps, games and movies.

As Daydream will be deeply integrated into Android Nougat, it was a neat surprise to see that Google has put the entire Play Store within view while wearing a Daydream headset.

The Google Play Store takes on a familiar look in the VR space, with each individual app having its own rating and description. Google has also added the level of motion that you'll experience within each app, just so that you know what sort of immersion you're about to get yourself into.

Performance

Daydream requires these three pillars in order to be a viable VR option: smartphones that are optimized for VR, with a high quality system on chip (SoC) to maintain 60 frames-per-second playback, low persistence displays to eliminate ghosting and lag, and finally, top-notch sensors that operate with minimal latency to boost the sense of presence.

So, what sort of performance can we reasonably expect out of it? Well, you'd be right to think that it really depends on the power of the phone that's inside.

Google's new Pixel and Pixel XL phones pack a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor and 4GB of RAM as well as running a FHD (1080p) screen on the Pixel and a QHD (2K) screen on the Pixel XL. You can bet that these devices will be primed to push high-quality VR experiences.

But, let's say that you have one of the upcoming Daydream Ready phones and power isn't much of an issue. Sources have suggested that Daydream will provide better performance than the Gear VR, but (understandably) not as good as what the Rift or Vive can push.

As time goes on, bringing more powerful systems on a chip (SoC) and pixel dense screens along with it, Daydream will begin to play ball on the same court as PC-tethered headsets. But that's not to say that it won't be showing some serious promise out of the gate.

Unity and Epic each announced their support for Daydream, which will open the door for game developers to push their next projects out for Google's new VR platform.

Google is making Android Nougat as VR-friendly as possible. To do that, the Daydream team worked closely with the core Android team to build VR mode, consisting of some new features that will help squeeze high levels of performance out of your daily driver.

First off, low latency support is coming to Android Nougat to help your actions, like head or controller movements, appear onscreen with minimal delay. Next up, there's a new sustained performance mode to help phones stay at that high level of performance for a longer duration of time than we've seen previously in Cardboard, a notorious battery sucker.

Nougat will take full advantage of your Daydream Ready phone's sensors with new head-tracking algorithms. And, to keep you in the viewer when a call or text comes through, Google has ported several elements of N's user interface into Daydream.

Daydream + Project Tango

Project Tango is Google's ambitious VR/AR technology that packs all of the fanciest features you've seen in the Microsoft HoloLens into a tablet, or in Lenovo and Intel's case, some very large phone. It relies on a multi-camera and multi-sensor setup to detect three-dimensional depth and motion, which can digitally map the space around and find your location in it so you can run amok. The end result brings your reality into a virtual one, which holds a ton of promise.

Current applications for the technology include helping you navigate through a museum and getting way more interactive with the art. If that sounds boring, trust me, it's not. Expanding off of that, will there be games made for Project Tango? You bet. Will Project Tango-enabled phones work with Daydream? Google has confirmed it, but as of yet, hasn't shed any details on the plan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the TIOBE Index only catalogues the relative popularity of programming languages via search engines, not how often they're actually used in real life, it's a handy tool for figuring out what skills to learn if you're chasing a career in technology.

Every year, this award goes to ""the programming language that has gained the most popularity in a year."" And ""without hardly any competition Go has won the award for 2016,"" TIOBE writes. Plus, TIOBE says that among its paying customers, it's seeing more interest in Go in industrial settings.

Since 2009, Google has been overseeing the community-led development of Go — a programming language aimed at helping web developers build apps at Google's scale and Google's speed, with a focus on rock-solid performance and ease of use, rather than chasing after the latest fads in programming.

Go has won its fair share of fans in programmer-land, not least because it provides a viable alternative to Oracle's Java, which has ruled the world of computer programming for the last two decades. Google's been using Go internally to power things like its download servers, where you grab stuff like the Chrome install files.

Languages to watch in 2017

The runner-ups for programming language of the year, per TIOBE, were Dart (another Google-led programming language, incidentally) and Perl, a NASA-created language renowned for its reliability, if not its elegance.

Other movers and shakers on the list include Facebook's Hack, which shot up to 51st place on the list from 67 in 2015, and Julia, a language that shot up from 73rd to 52nd place.

The TIOBE Index expects that in 2017, the favored candidates for programming language of the year will include Apple's Swift, Julia, the Microsoft'created TypeScript, and the ever-popular C++.

Incidentally, back in August 2016, the C programming language —the legendary programming language invented in 1972 and still widely used — recorded its lowest-ever score on the TIOBE Index since its creation in 2001. It looks like C finished 2016 with a lower score still, showing signs of fading even as its offshoot C++ gains on it quickly.

Several Google Voice users this week reported seeing an upgrade link touting “the new Google Voice” on the web version of the service, along with a link that would let them try it out. Clearly, the message was posted too early because the upgrade didn’t come through when the link was clicked.

However, its existence has been an encouraging sign for Google Voice customers, many of whom have felt as if the service has been abandoned in favor of Google’s many newer efforts in the communications space, including Hangouts, and more recently, messaging apps like Allo and Duo.

According to the Droid Life blog, which was one of the first to see the upgrade link appear, the banner popped up at the top of the screen when they logged into their account, with a message that read: “The new Google Voice is here. TRY NOW.” But when they tried it, the page just refreshed and they remained on the current user interface.

Google Voice hasn’t been updated in some time, making the product feel a bit been abandoned. Many are saying it hasn’t had any attention in years, but that’s not entirely true. It didn’t receive much attention in 2016, but before that, the last notable updates have included things like Google Hangouts’ integration with Google Voice back in fall 2014, and 2015’s update which improved Google Voice’s voicemail transcriptions.

Still, its updates have been few and far between, despite the usefulness of the service and its potential. Google’s failure to continue investing in the space has allowed other voice calling apps the ability to gain ground. Not only are voice messaging apps a popular category today, the idea to give users the ability share a public phone number that can ring them anywhere, on a line that has its own voicemail and filtering options, is now something other startups, like Burner or newcomer Listen, are handling instead.

These Google Voice rivals have succeeded in part by focusing on mobile users – an area where Google Voice has fallen behind, having not updated its iOS and Android apps since the first half of last year.

After the flood of reports, Google confirmed that it’s working on some updates to Google Voice, but declined to give us further details ahead of the launch.

Google’s strategy with regards to its communications apps has been messy, so it will be interesting to see what the new Google Voice entails. The company has a number of communication products, which seem to be in a constant state of flux.

Hangouts, for example, has just seen its API shut down, which will effectively shutter the app ecosystem on the platform for most developers. The apps that were allowed to remain have an enterprise focus instead, as Google explained to developers in an email that it’s moving away from its consumer focus.

Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) is starting to get serious about letting users cash in on their popularity. Industry sources are telling Recode that Facebook is working with video publishers to test a ""mid-roll"" ad format on longer clips, a move that would take it a baby step closer to Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) YouTube in terms of content monetization.

It's important to frame this move correctly. Unlike YouTube, which lets any user apply to participate in revenue-sharing deals on their original uploads, Facebook's move is currently limited to established media companies. The videos must also be at least 90 seconds long to participate, something that may seem like an eternity in this clip culture.

We also don't know if Facebook's massive audience will put up with ads that interrupt a video 20 seconds into the streaming process. If pre-roll ads on Alphabet's YouTube are groan generators, it's hard to favor an advertising format that cuts into a clip just when the viewer is starting to grow engaged.

However, there's a method to Facebook's madness. Making publishers put out longer videos to hit the 90-second minimum and making them engaging enough to retain viewers 20 seconds into the clip will make the social networking hub more engaging.

Taking on YouTube

Video and eventually video advertising have been part of Facebook's master plan for some time. With 1.79 billion monthly active users, giving the internet's largest social networking audience some eye candy makes sense. However, with YouTube and recently Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) ramping up their monetization tools, Facebook is going to have to start offering financial incentives to top creators if it doesn't want folks to take their viral videos somewhere else.

Revenue-sharing deals have been around since Alphabet launched the YouTube Partners program in 2007. Twitter would go on to revamp Twitter Amplify in 2015, letting major entertainment brands cash in on pre-roll video ads streaming through the site. The program was reportedly opening up to individual creators late last year.

Facebook will inevitably have to follow suit. Facebook Live has helped the site become the home to several news-generating streams , but if it wants folks to rely on it as their primary broadcasting hub, they are going to have to transform Facebook into a cottage industry for 1.79 billion cottages. Alphabet's YouTube is doing that (and successfully). Twitter is trying.

It won't be easy for Facebook. Folks already accept ads on YouTube, and YouTube has gotten better by rolling out a wide array of ad types. Facebook has limited the revenue-generating opportunities on its clips only to high-end publishers and then mostly through brand sponsorships that aren't as invasive as the mid-roll ads it will reportedly be testing out now. However, if Facebook users don't flinch -- and if Facebook is quick to roll out these options to much smaller publishers -- it can make the already sticky social networking giant even more engaging to both content creators and content consumers.

What ever happened to Facebook 's(NASDAQ: FB) scary comments that ad load wouldn't be a big part of revenue growth in 2017? Seemingly contradicting those statements is a report yesterday from Recode that says the social network is preparing to implement mid-roll video ads, which play in the middle of a video, opening up a new form of monetization for publishers that will share ad revenue with Facebook. Publishers will keep 55% of ad revenue, with the remaining 45% going to Facebook. Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) YouTube, which is the top dog in the video ad market, offers the same revenue-sharing split.

If this report is true, the move would represent a departure from CEO Mark Zuckerberg's long-standing ban on pre-roll ads, which play at the beginning of a video. That's largely why publishers have had such a hard time building video businesses on the social network, since not allowing pre-roll ads significantly hinders monetization. Yet Facebook is too large to ignore, so publishers continue to try to expand on the platform despite the challenging economics to date. The company has been experimenting and slowly rolling out new ways for publishers to make money, but a broader deployment of mid-roll ads would represent a big step in the right direction for publishers.

Keeping Facebookers engaged

The new mid-roll ads will only be presented after a user has watched at least 20 seconds of a video, and the total clip length must be at least 90 seconds. That sets a minimum threshold for engagement; Facebook wants publishers to produce engaging content that keeps people's attention in order to earn that video ad revenue. This makes sense if you go back and look through the aforementioned comments from November discussing ad load.

CFO Dave Wehner had mentioned that ad load was but one of three major factors that have been contributing to revenue growth. User growth naturally contributes quite a bit as well, spurring advertiser demand. The third factor is the growth in time spent on Facebook. Here's some additional color that Wehner provided in November:

Just really reiterating what I said last quarter about our expectations on ad load going into mid-2017. It's been one of the key factors in terms of driving growth, along with time spent -- user growth and time spent growth and advertiser demand. So we continue to see good opportunities to grow time spent, continue to see good opportunities to grow users, and we continue to see good opportunities to grow advertiser demand. On that latter point, really the mix of ad units is part of what we're doing, I think, really well. We're developing a number of new ad products as well as enhancing the ad products that we have out in the market today. So we're taking what is a great mobile ad product on Facebook and Instagram and making it even better. And I think the investments that we're doing there will continue to enable us to drive advertiser demand. Those key factors will continue, we believe, to drive growth next year. So what I'm specifically talking about is ad load and our anticipation that it's going to be a less significant factor as we get into mid-2017.

Overall, Facebook's ad platform continues to evolve, offering a wider range of ad formats that can accommodate a wider range of content types. The overall ad load may not increase much, so it's a good thing that video ads are incredibly lucrative.

Currently, shares of the company make up a whopping 13% of my family's real-life stock holdings. But we're totally comfortable with that allocation.

Here's why:

1. The company's flagship product has a dominant market (and mind) share

If you're sitting around the dinner table arguing about a provable fact, you resolve the dispute by simply ""Googling"" the answer. The fact that the name is so embedded in our lexicon speaks volumes to the search engine's dominance.

According to Statista, Alphabet's Google search owns 90.4% of the global market on desktops. And perhaps more important, according to NetMarketShare, it commands 93.8% of the mobile search market share globally.

2. It boasts six other products with over 1 billion users

But as you're probably well aware, Google is much more than just search. It has six other applications with over 1 billion users. These include Gmail, YouTube, Google Maps, Chrome, Android, and Google Play Store.

3. That all adds up to a lot of data

""Sure,"" you might say, ""but the company doesn't charge for most of those products. That's not great business.""

Image source: Getty Images.

While you'd be right, you'd be missing out on what's dubbed the ""oil of the information age"": data. With every user in all seven of those aforementioned apps, the company is able to collect gobs of data. In fact, I don't think it would be too hard to argue that Google has more data on the people walking this earth than any other organization, at any other time in human history.

4. At its heart, it is still an advertising company

That data is worth billions to advertisers. In the old days, companies would try to target their audience by putting ads in magazines or newspapers where potential customers might be lurking. But the feedback loop wasn't great: Advertisers never knew just how effective that ad spending was.

Not so anymore. With Google's advertising platform, companies get real-time feedback on how efficiently their ads are being placed, and how much business they produce. Given the data hoard that the company has, ads placed through Google can be more targeted to the perfect customer than any other available source. That's a huge moat for the company.

It also helps explain why Google advertising brought in $67 billion in sales last year for the company, or 90% of all revenue.

5. Digital ads are poised to grow

If you think you've missed the boat, rest assured you haven't. A March 2016 report from eMarketer shows that there's still a lot of room for internet advertising to grow.

And with TV still retaining one-third of the global market share in 2019, I can only imagine that the runway for internet ad growth will continue for much of the next decade.

6. The company is more than a one-trick pony

Back to that name change, from ""Google"" to ""Alphabet."" You might better understand the reasoning if you look at the new corporate name as ""Alpha-Bet."" This rendering of the name reflects the company's practice of taking a lot of moonshot bets on revolutionary technologies outside its main search and data-capturing business.

This is what famed trader, academic, and thinker Nassim Taleb would call a barbell approach: having a large a reliable stream of revenue on one side while taking lots of small bets on the other. While the likelihood of any one moonshot succeeding is small, all it will take is one or two winners over the next decade to make a meaningful difference for shareholders.

What are these moonshots? We probably don't know all of them, but the ones we do include self-driving cars, a connected home, a life sciences company, and lightning-fast internet connection.

7. Its mission statement is memorable

I'm a sucker for a good mission statement. When it is clear and powerful, it can be the compass that helps guide management and employees alike toward a common goal.

Google's mission statement is: ""To organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.""

The mission of new-formed parent company Alphabet is multifaceted but can be broken down to: ""Getting more ambitious things done[,] ... empowering great entrepreneurs and companies to flourish ... [and] as a result of all this, improving the lives of as many people as we can.""

Those are both powerful and flexible enough objectives to keep the company relevant in a quickly changing world.

8. It has soul in the game

Lest you think that you might have a few executives who are in this for short-term gain, Alphabet is still run by its co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Together, they -- along with all of the other company executives and board members -- own almost 48 million shares of Alphabet, and account for 60% of the company's voting power. To put the number of shares in perspective, it is equivalent to almost $40 billion at today's prices.

9. The proof is in the culture

Another metric that's often overlooked is a company's culture. If Page and Brin really do want to accomplish the ambitious goals they've laid out, they need a stable and motivated workforce to get things done.

To get an idea for the company's approach, a 2010 filing with the SEC stated that ""[monetary] incentives are secondary to career growth, work environment, and engaging work opportunities. We seek to develop a highly motivated and collaborative workforce that pursues achievements for the sake of progress and innovation before individual gain.""

Based on employee reviews on Glassdoor.com, I'd say the company is doing pretty well.

10. There is lots of cash to make it work

Finally, if you've got a company that's going to be taking lots of small bets that can be costly, it's good to know that management is sitting on a pretty expansive war chest. And that's what you get with Alphabet.

Long-term debt: $3.9 billion

Cash, short-, and long-term investments: $88.8 billion

This, and the other nine reasons above, helps me sleep well at night knowing my family is invested in -- and likely won't sell for a long time -- such a company.

At the beginning of 2016, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) CEO Tim Cook was faced with the fact that iPhone sales would decline for the first time in history that year. To shift Wall Street's focus away from the impending decline in unit sales he aptly pointed out, ""A growing portion of our revenue is directly driven by our existing install base. Because our customers are very satisfied and engaged, they spend a lot of time on their devices and purchase apps, content, and other services.""

Indeed, while iPhone sales declined 12% in fiscal 2016, Apple's services continued climbing higher for the year. A big part of that growth is the continued increase in sales through the App Store. Earlier this month, Apple provided a roundup of App Store highlights from 2016. Here are the five most important facts for Apple investors to know.

App developers earned $20 billion last year

Apple paid out $20 billion to iOS developers in 2016. That's up 40% year over year, according to Apple.

The $20 billion paid to developers implies Apple kept over $8 billion in revenue for itself using its standard 30/70 split. While some subscription services received a higher revenue share, they still represent a relatively small percentage of App Store revenue. Last year, Apple generated an estimated $6 billion in revenue from the App Store.

Apple's user base is significantly more willing to pay for apps and services than Google's. The Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) subsidiary consistently sees little more than half the revenue from its Play Store as the App Store, according to App Annie. That makes Apple's still-growing install base extremely valuable even if iPhone unit sales declined.

2.2 million apps available

The 2.2 million apps available for download in the App Store represent a 20% increase year over year. Additionally, the most recent update is indicative that developers are steadily adding apps to the App Store. Apple announced that it reached 2 million apps in June at its WWDC presentation -- just about the halfway point of the year.

Several new apps made a big splash in 2016, including Pokemon Go and Super Mario Run . Just as importantly, if not more so, older games such as Monster Strike and Fantasy Westward were some of the top-grossing apps in the App Store.

While Apple is adding a good number of new apps, sales are growing much faster. That's a good sign of an expanding user base and a growing willingness to pay for apps.

$240 million in sales on New Year's Day

Jan. 1 was once again Apple's biggest sales day for the App Store. Last year, it set a new record on New Year's Day with $144 million in sales. This year, sales rocketed 67% year over year to $240 million.

That growth is a strong indicator that Apple may continue to see robust growth from the App Store in 2017.

$2.7 billion in subscription revenue

Of the $28 billion or so in App Store sales, nearly 10% came from subscriptions. This summer, Apple altered its revenue share agreement with subscription services, dropping from a 30/70 split to a 15/85 split after one year. This gave an incentive to more subscription services to start offering subscriptions through the App Store.

The growth of the Apple TV App Store also likely led to an increase in subscription sales for Apple. 2016 represented the first full year Apple opened the platform to all developers.

China grew 90%

App sales in China grew 90% year over year in 2016. China surpassed the U.S. as the largest download market for iOS apps in the first quarter, according to App Annie . However, it still trails the U.S. and Japan in terms of App Store revenue for now.

While China represents one of Apple's largest markets, sales in the region declined more than its other regions in 2016. The iPhone 6 was extremely popular in the country during fiscal 2015, leading to a decline in sales the next year. But App Store sales continue to climb faster than Apple's average. That's indicative of the large opportunity of the relatively young user base in the region.

Overall, Apple's App Store had another great year of growth, and 2017 looks to be off to a strong start.

The biggest buzz coming out of this year's Consumer Electronics Show boils down to Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC ) putting its money where its mouth is on transforming the global transportation landscape.

Source: stargazer2020 via Flickr

It takes big bucks to go toe-to-toe with the likes of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) on smart cars, but INTC clearly wants to find its niche in the mix before this trend really takes off.

The major piece of news is that Intel is buying 15% of mapping startup company Here from a consortium of German carmakers, including BMW (OTCMKTS: BMWYY ) . The Germans paid $3.1 billion to buy Here a year ago, so I have a hunch that that the car companies are flipping for a profit and INTC is paying a premium.

But that's okay for two reasons.

Why Buying Here Is Good for INTC Stock

First, the market took INTC's decision to commit $250 million to autonomous cars back in November as a bit of a joke.

In a world where AAPL can blithely spend $1 billion to buy into a Chinese fleet management company and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) has probably blown at least that much cash getting its cars on the road, the initial ante from INTC looked relatively unimpressive.

You've got to be serious about this market as it emerges and companies pick their partners. Spending this much money on Here proves INTC is very serious and creates a space for its hardware under the hood of some of the world's leading car brands - including BMW, which will be testing self-driving systems powered by INTC in its prototype cars late this year.

Second, this is more than just another copycat mapping system; this is the platform originally pioneered for Nokia Corp (ADR) (NYSE: NOK ) phones, which a lot of people still consider superior to anything that's hit Android or iOS mobile devices. Buying a piece of Here guarantees that INTC will be relevant to any discussion around how cars, drones and everything else navigates across the Internet of Things.

This is a company that routinely books $22 billion a year in Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), cash flow it needs to reinvest in its future in order to keep tech funds happy.

But unlike a lot of moon shots coming out of Silicon Valley, this bet can actually make an impact on INTC's ultimate bottom line.

Bottom Line for INTC

The latest forecast indicates that vehicle automation might unlock $34 billion a year in the very near future. All of those cars may not have INTC technology inside, but even a 10% slice of that global opportunity can still double the company's currently anemic growth rate.

At the end of the day, that's what I and other investors want to see from events like CES: Not ""concept"" products that will never see real commercial deployment.

Smart cars are a real boom revving up. And in this race to the market, INTC now has a guaranteed place in the pit crew.

It's bad form to gloat. Apart from making you insufferable to be around at parties, you're tempting fate … and inviting a reversal of fortune.

That said, I'm going to risk it and toot my own horn here for a moment. I've had a good string of successes in InvestorPlace's annual Best Stocks contest. I took the top prize in 2011, the very first year of the contest, when my pick - credit card behemoth Visa Inc (NYSE: V ) - racked up a 34% return.

I followed that up in 2012 with a strong performance by Turkish mobile operator Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri A.S. (ADR) (NYSE: TKC ), just barely missing the top slot with a 37% return . And I reclaimed my crown in 2013 when German luxury automaker Daimler AG (OTCMKTS: DDAIF ) rolled to victory with a 65% return .

Alas, you can't win them all. My 2014 pick, South African mobile operator MTN Group Ltd (ADR) (OTCMKTS: MTNOY ) finished in last place, losing 6% . And my 2015 pick, business development company Prospect Capital Corporation (NASDAQ: PSEC ) finished in the middle of the pack, losing a modest 4% .

Well, in 2016, I got my groove back, winning InvestorPlace's Best Stock for 2016 contest with a 55% return in Energy Transfer Equity LP (NYSE: ETE ). Over the six years of the contest, my picks have returned an average of 30%. Not too shabby. Taking the top spot in 3 out of 6 years and coming in a close second in a fourth… I'll take that!

In 2017, I chose General Motors Company (NYSE: GM ), which is thus far off to a respectable start (see General Motors Will Roll to Victory ). May the best stock win!

I'm the first to admit that there is a lot of luck involved with winning a contest like this. Holding a single stock for exactly one calendar year is not how investors invest in the real world. And had the contests started on some other arbitrary date - say, Jan. 31 as opposed to Dec. 31 - then the returns across the board would look a lot different. So luck was definitely on my side with respect to the exact timing.

Yet all of my picks did have one thing in common: All were contrarian plays that no one else wanted at the time.

Let's take Energy Transfer Equity as an example. Right now, shares are riding high on optimism that the incoming Donald Trump administration will be friendlier to pipeline operators. The Barack Obama administration has been openly hostile, with their halting of ETE's Dakota Access Pipeline being a prime example. The change in the White House has investors looking at this entire sector in a more positive light.

But think back to this time last year. The prices of oil and gas were crashing, and rival pipeline operator Kinder Morgan Inc (NYSE: KMI ) had just cut its dividend, leaving investors to wonder who might be next to slash their payout. ETE's sister companies weren't looking especially healthy, and Energy Transfer Equity was embroiled in a controversial takeover bid of Williams Companies Inc (NYSE: WMB ). Before the selloff was finished, ETE would drop by just shy of 90%.

While terrifying, these are the moments that value investors live for. If you do your homework, you can have confidence that your pick will come out of the selloff in one piece.

Let's consider ETE for a moment. Given the turbulence in the credit market that was making it hard for the company to raise capital, I knew there was a good chance it might have to slash its distribution or, at a minimum, stop growing it at the blistering 30% annual rate that we'd become accustomed to seeing. But I also knew that ETE's empire had real, tangible assets in its pipeline network that would put a floor under the stock price and ensure its survival as a company.

I also knew that Dallas billionaire Kelcy Warren - the founder and CEO of Energy Transfer - had a substantial part of his entire fortune tied up in ETE stock, so the person running the company had every incentive to do whatever it took to make it survive. Mr. Warren had a lot more at risk than I did.

Obviously, none of this guaranteed I would win the Best Stocks contest, but it definitely put me in position to do well. And when crude oil prices found a bottom and the credit markets settled down, ETE started its epic run.

I'm still long Energy Transfer Equity, and I expect it to rise another 50% to 100% over the next two to three years. But let's now take a quick look at General Motors, my pick for the Best Stocks for 2017.

General Motors is not in the midst of an industry-wide meltdown like Energy Transfer Equity was a year ago. But I can credibly say that GM, like ETE, is a cheap stock that no one wanted. As I'm writing this, General Motors trades for an almost ridiculous 6 times earnings and 0.34 times sales. It seems that the market expects GM's sales to massively slow down in the years ahead. And to be fair, with ride sharing services like Uber and the promise of driverless cars on the horizon, handicapping GM's future prospects is a challenge.

But at current prices, a lot of bad news is already priced in. GM doesn't have to have record year of auto sales in order for the stock to do well. It simply needs to avoid blowing up, and I consider that a safe bet.

Will that be enough to push GM into the top spot in 2017? Only time will tell, but I like my chances.

The 2017 Consumer Electronics Show may have wound down, but the rumors around it certainly haven't. The latest is centered on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ), a company that wasn't even at CES 2017. A well-known technology blogger is convinced he uncovered a partnership between AAPL and German optical company Carl Zeiss AG to develop Apple AR glasses. And he thinks they'll be released in 2017.

Source: Twitter

The new rumor about Apple AR glasses started when technology blogger Robert Scoble wrote a post on Facebook. In it, he laid out a series of clues that led him to conclude that something is up between Apple and Carl Zeiss AG.

CES 2017, Carl Zeiss AG and Augmented Reality

He started with a photo showing Carl Zeiss AG clearly had a booth located in the Augmented Reality section of CES 2017. However, the company had no AR technology on display, which was odd. Scoble approached the staff operating the booth and asked them if the lack of product was because Tim Cook had refused to allow them to show it and got a nervous reaction that seemed to confirm his suspicions. He went on to write:

""A Zeiss employee confirmed the rumors that Apple and Carl Zeiss AG are working on a light pair of augmented reality/mixed reality glasses that may be announced this year.""

If Scoble is correct in his prediction, AAPL could be adding Apple AR glasses to a big product release year that includes a 10th anniversary iPhone 8.

Apple AR Glasses Are Far From a Long Shot

What Scoble wrote is a rumor. It's based on deductions and conversation with an un-named Carl Zeiss AG employee, so it's far from fact. However, it's not as far-fetched as it may sound.

There have been rumblings over the past few months that AAPL is developing its own Apple AR glasses . Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) may have stumbled with its Google Glass version, but that doesn't mean augmented reality glasses are dead in the water.

The AR field had a good year in 2016 - think games like Pokémon Go - and Snap, Inc. released its inexpensive Snapchat Spectacles later in the year. Both have been very popular and show that AR is likely to hit the mainstream before virtual reality does.

AAPL has already publicly supported the concept of augmented reality multiple times in recent months. In a July earnings meeting, CEO Tim Cook said :

""AR can be really great. We have been and continue to invest a lot in this. We're high on AR in the long run and we think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity.""

And in September, Cook was quoted by Business Insider as saying:

""There's virtual reality and there's augmented reality - both of these are incredibly interesting. But my own view is that augmented reality is the larger of the two, probably by far.""

Clearly, Cook has been giving more than passing thought to augmented reality and in the quest to create a new, high-demand product line, Apple AR glasses could fit the bill. Carl Zeiss AG is a highly respected German company specializing in optical technology, so in terms of a partnership that makes perfect sense.

Google Glass may have failed to crack the augmented reality market, but it gave AAPL the opportunity to do what it does best: Learn from a rival's mistakes and come back with its own version that nails it.

Apple AR glasses seem more likely than ever to be the next big new thing from AAPL and if Robert Scoble is right, they could be arriving as soon as this year.

As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Since 2012, automotive-industry disrupter Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ) has raised roughly $6.5 billion from investors to support its audacious ambitions.

Source: Shutterstock

So far, Tesla stock has accumulated losses in the billions from the capital it's raised. But as you may well know, past performance has little to do with what might happen in the future.

Also, in its current full year (2015 to 2016 results have yet to be finalized) of operations, Tesla reported a loss of $888 million and spent $1.6 billion to develop new factories and manufacturing capabilities, including a pioneering ""gigafactory"" to churn out scores of lithium batteries for its automobiles and burgeoning solar operations.

Tesla also issued more than $300 million in debt and sold another $730 million in stock. Revolutionizing industries is not a cheap undertaking.

Things got more interesting in July when Tesla announced it would purchase SolarCity. Investors approved the deal and SolarCity was folded into the corporate fold. The term ""clean energy empire"" has been mentioned, with potential synergies of using Tesla's batteries to store energy produced from solar panels on the top of consumer roofs. Clean energy is the all-around goal.

Tesla's Auto Ambitions

Of course, Tesla has huge plans and first intends to revolutionize the automotive industry. In many respects, it is just getting warmed up as a company. Its fourth-quarter net orders for new cars (its Model S and Model X) jumped 52%. Vehicle production increased an impressive 64% to nearly 84,000 vehicles for all of 2016.

Scale is key for Tesla's vehicle operations. It will improve car reliability and lower warranty costs because of manufacturing efficiencies. Growth also provides operating leverage. More sales help offset fixed costs in factories, showrooms and everything that goes with building a car company from the ground up. Management likes to highlight a steady improvement in gross margins to illustrate the benefits of its growing scale.

The Solar and Autonomous Auto Wildcards

The same goes for SolarCity. Elon Musk, who effectively controlled both Tesla and SolarCity before they merged, spoke to creating a solar roof product for homes. Manufacturing scale also benefits the production of solar panels and distributing throughout the country. High-efficiency cells at a low cost is the goal in this part of the business.

Tesla also has big plans for self-driving cars. Other players in the space include the venture capital unit of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG ,NASDAQ: GOOGL ), and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ), who builds chips to support autonomous vehicle capabilities.

Is Tesla Too Ambitious?

There is certainly an argument to be made that Tesla is too ambitious. Musk has spoken about producing a million cars by 2020, and its gigafactory is said to cost as much as $5 billion, though other partners and suppliers will share in the expense.

SolarCity is thought to be cash flow neutral when it is officially folded in during the last quarter of 2016. However, it did add more debt to the capital structure.

Analysts are projecting earnings losses for 2016 and 2017. This year, they estimate a loss of $2.15, but a significant improvement to a loss of only 73 cents for all of 2017.

Those that are offering an investment opinion overwhelmingly believe the stock is a ""hold"" (versus a sell or buy) right now.

There is little denying the investment uncertainty is high for Tesla stock. There are many moving parts, and there isn't much current visibility on positive profit or cash flow production. In fact, there are likely to be many more years of aggressive spending and investment to scale the car and solar operations.

The Bottom Line on Tesla Stock

The market capitalization for Tesla stock currently sits around $37 billion. That seems a rather high number for a company generating only about $6 billion in annual sales and nothing to speak of in terms of profits.

An investment in Tesla stock is really a call on Elon Musk's ambitions and his vision of creating a truly revolutionary automotive and energy firm. Certainly, energy stored via batteries has many benefits over current technologies supported by gas and other fossil fuels to create energy.

Storing energy through batteries has huge potential ramifications for the global energy sector, and helping scale that development via a giant gigafactory in the Nevada desert could turn out truly revolutionary.

But investing in the potential is another story.

To me, it seems too risky to hope that sales and profits come flowing in within a decade. There will likely be many ups and downs, with many chances for investors to buy in with more certainty down the road.

Until then, they might want to consider stodgy General Motors Company (NYSE: GM ), which has a reasonable valuation and high dividend yield. It won't benefit from the growth in consumer solar panels, but stands a good chance at participating in the electric and autonomous automobile markets that Tesla is paving a new path in.

As of this writing, Ryan Fuhrmann did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Jerusalem-based MobilEye (NYSE: MBLY) is as pure a play as they come for driverless-car stocks. It manufactures the cameras for advanced driver assistance systems in approximately 220 car models. In July, MobilEye announced a partnership with BMW and Intel to develop an autonomous-vehicle platform by 2021. Just a month later, it went even further when it announced a partnership with auto supplier Delphi Automotive to develop a ""plug-and-play"" self-driving platform available for any automaker to adopt by 2017.

MobilEye seems to be poised for profit -- it just announced a 34% year-over-year quarterly revenue increase and prides itself on an asset-light business model. For investors, this signals both a buying opportunity and a valuation warning. Its stock jumped 27% after the recent news and has wavered back and forth over the past few years alongside industry-level bullishness and stock-specific announcements. Investors in MobilEye should be bullish on the commoditization of driverless technology and have a long-term perspective to weather the ups and downs that will probably continue.

2. Tesla Motors -- The car

Image source: Tesla Motors.

Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA) is not a driverless-car stock, but it is vehement in its belief that automation is the automotive future. All its vehicles come equipped with Autopilot, a technology that Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk says will allow Teslas to drive themselves across the country by (hopefully) 2018. As a first major adopter of semi-autonomous driving, Tesla has experienced setbacks, most notably a driver fatality last May.

A Tesla Motors stock investment allows investors to get behind the wheel of an already-scaling semi-driverless carl , something that no other company can offer. But Tesla is also much more than a driverless-car stock. The company is, first and foremost, a (driver-filled) car company. Its recent $2 billion merger with SolarCity also makes it a solar company, an industry with substantial regulatory unknowns of its own. The company is betting on significant synergies by packaging solar rooftops with car sales, but these major moves have kept many investors on the fence about its future. For Tesla to make the driverless-car stock list, investors need to be sure they're bullish on its entire business.

3. Alphabet -- The data

Video source: Waymo via Youtube .

Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , the parent company of Google, has been making major moves in the driverless-car space. The company has spent more than $60 million to bump humans out of the driver's seat, and last October, it announced that it had clocked a whopping 2 million road miles on its autonomous vehicles. Last month, Alphabet went a step further by redefining its automation efforts as a full-fledged spinoff business dubbed Waymo, rather than one of its prototype ""moonshot"" projects.

Alphabet and Waymo have made clear that they're not interested in car manufacturing, a hat tip to others such as BMW that are already well entrenched in this space. Instead, it will focus on taking what it's learned from its cute ""panda car"" prototypes and transferring it to commercial cars, such as the 100 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans that are set to join Waymo's fleet in early 2017. Waymo has a strong technological advantage over many competitors, but where it truly shines is its access to and refinement of data. Self-driving cars risk being aimless wanderers without enough information about their surroundings, and Alphabet has more information about the world than anyone else, and is continuing to learn how best to use it in the quest for an autonomous vehicle.

With an Alphabet investment, investors need to understand that driverless cars are not one slice of this company's pie -- they're a crumb. With Alphabet's $550 billion market cap, Waymo's minuscule $60 million fleet of pandas and minivans is not what this company's counting on to drive profits in the years to come. But Waymo is yet another example of how Alphabet is capitalizing on its core competitive advantage in ways that were not previously expected -- and if that's what you're interested in investing in, then Alphabet may be the driverless-car stock for you.

Pedal to the metal?

With driverless-car technology still in its infancy, it can be tempting to take a backseat to investing in this industry. But for risk-tolerant investors with a long-term perspective, getting in on the ground floor of a driverless-car stock might be the best way to snag major returns in the years to come, whether it's by investing in the technology, the car , or the data.

By all accounts Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) had a fabulous Consumer Electronics Show. According to InvestorPlace contributor Brad Moon, Alexa was the big winner of CES 2017 - an event the company didn't even have its own booth at. The company's Alexa voice assistant could eventually become an operating system , showing up last week in refrigerators, cars and robots. But what kind of affect does this have on AMZN stock?

Amazon's ability to get its assistant supported by hardware contrasted with the failures of Siri from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Cortana from Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ), and Google Assistant from Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ).

Amazon did it, first, by delivering the assistant to millions through its Echo speakers and, second, by allowing it to run on the cheapest imaginable hardware, focusing instead on the cloud-based Alexa Voice Service API. Rivals sought to use their voice assistants to tie hardware to their higher-end ecosystems, and they are unlikely to show much for consumer markets before next year.

AMZN stock had fallen from a high of nearly $850 per share in October to a post-election low of barely $720. To many investors that is starting to look like yet-another missed opportunity to get in.

Spectacular Whispers

The ""whisper number"" on Amazon's Christmas-season earnings have become outrageous. The latest is for earnings of $1.43 per share on revenues of $44.70 billion. Last Christmas, by contrast, Amazon did $1.00 per share of earnings on revenues of $35.747 billion and, after another one of those discouraging falls (this time to near $500), rose steadily to that near-$850 high.

If AMZN stock matches expectations, you're talking about top-line growth of 25% and earnings growth of 43%, year-over-year. You're still talking about paying nearly three times sale for a retailer, when successful merchants like Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT ) get just 40 cents of equity for each dollar of sales, but Amazon is no longer a retailer.

Since then, of course, AMZN has become a major TV studio, with the Golden Globes to prove it. In addition to its $100 per year Prime shipping plan, which includes the video offerings and ties customers to the shopping service with free shipping, Amazon has added $10-per-month plans for music and eBooks - I've lately found the Kindle Unlimited offering to be outstanding.

Its Amazon Web Services cloud is practically an industry standard, and its most recent report showed it growing 55% per year, to a run rate of over $11 billion , with high profitability. If Alexa is becoming an operating system, akin to Windows, Android and Apple's iOS, many will consider it highly undervalued.

The Bear Case for AMZN Stock

Every story like this must include a bear case for the stock.

Back in 2012, when I first started accumulating shares at about $330 each, bears claimed that Amazon didn't make any money, that it was a ""Ponzi scheme"" and, essentially, an over-priced merchandiser.

Just last week, InvestorPlace contributor Chris Tyler wrote that the technicals were bad, that the data collected by the Echo may become subject to judicial review and that the incoming Administration doesn't like the company.

Scams are proliferating on the service and one long-time Amazon bull, Trip Chowdhry of Global Equities, told his followers to dump AMZN stock late last year, saying cloud growth catalysts are gone .

I'm Not Selling Amazon Stock

I disagree. AMZN stock has become like Apple, a stock you buy when you can and hold onto. I have more than doubled my money on Amazon stock since 2013, and while it's becoming an uncomfortably large part of my retirement account, I'm going to own it for the long haul.

We are still in the early innings of the cloud revolution, voice operating systems are brand-new and the disruption of cable by internet offerings like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and Amazon Prime has really just begun.

AMZN remains hungry, entering the activewear market under its own brand, private labels in food and geography-specific offerings like a move into India's big market for second-hand goods.

Even at its present sales level, Amazon is still less than one-third as large as Walmart, with better penetration of international markets and now it is a true player in the ""great game"" of technology industry leadership.

If I weren't stuffed with AMZN stock (no retirement account should have all its eggs in one basket) I'd be buying more. And that may be the key caution I can offer. When everyone is this bullish, listen to the bear.

And in truth, it is: The future is simply unknowable. But I've owned shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)(NASDAQ:GOOG) -- formerly known as Google -- for almost a decade, and I can't fathom a circumstance under which I'd consider parting with my shares.

Currently, shares of the company make up a whopping 13% of my family's real-life stock holdings. But we're totally comfortable with that allocation.

Here's why:

1. The company's flagship product has a dominant market (and mind) share

If you're sitting around the dinner table arguing about a provable fact, you resolve the dispute by simply ""Googling"" the answer. The fact that the name is so embedded in our lexicon speaks volumes to the search engine's dominance.

According to Statista, Alphabet's Google search owns 90.4% of the global market on desktops. And perhaps more important, according to NetMarketShare, it commands 93.8% of the mobile search market share globally.

2. It boasts six other products with over 1 billion users

But as you're probably well aware, Google is much more than just search. It has six other applications with over 1 billion users. These include Gmail, YouTube, Google Maps, Chrome, Android, and Google Play Store.

3. That all adds up to a lot of data

""Sure,"" you might say, ""but the company doesn't charge for most of those products. That's not great business.""

While you'd be right, you'd be missing out on what's dubbed the ""oil of the information age"": data. With every user in all seven of those aforementioned apps, the company is able to collect gobs of data. In fact, I don't think it would be too hard to argue that Google has more data on the people walking this earth than any other organization, at any other time in human history.

4. At its heart, it is still an advertising company

That data is worth billions to advertisers. In the old days, companies would try to target their audience by putting ads in magazines or newspapers where potential customers might be lurking. But the feedback loop wasn't great: Advertisers never knew just how effective that ad spending was.

Not so anymore. With Google's advertising platform, companies get real-time feedback on how efficiently their ads are being placed, and how much business they produce. Given the data hoard that the company has, ads placed through Google can be more targeted to the perfect customer than any other available source. That's a huge moat for the company.

It also helps explain why Google advertising brought in $67 billion in sales last year for the company, or 90% of all revenue.

5. Digital ads are poised to grow

If you think you've missed the boat, rest assured you haven't. A March 2016 report from eMarketer shows that there's still a lot of room for internet advertising to grow.

And with TV still retaining one-third of the global market share in 2019, I can only imagine that the runway for internet ad growth will continue for much of the next decade.

6. The company is more than a one-trick pony

Back to that name change, from ""Google"" to ""Alphabet."" You might better understand the reasoning if you look at the new corporate name as ""Alpha-Bet."" This rendering of the name reflects the company's practice of taking a lot of moonshot bets on revolutionary technologies outside its main search and data-capturing business.

This is what famed trader, academic, and thinker Nassim Taleb would call a barbell approach: having a large a reliable stream of revenue on one side while taking lots of small bets on the other. While the likelihood of any one moonshot succeeding is small, all it will take is one or two winners over the next decade to make a meaningful difference for shareholders.

What are these moonshots? We probably don't know all of them, but the ones we do include self-driving cars, a connected home, a life sciences company, and lightning-fast internet connection.

7. Its mission statement is memorable

I'm a sucker for a good mission statement. When it is clear and powerful, it can be the compass that helps guide management and employees alike toward a common goal.

Google's mission statement is: ""To organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.""

The mission of new-formed parent company Alphabet is multifaceted but can be broken down to: ""Getting more ambitious things done[,] ... empowering great entrepreneurs and companies to flourish ... [and] as a result of all this, improving the lives of as many people as we can.""

Those are both powerful and flexible enough objectives to keep the company relevant in a quickly changing world.

8. It has soul in the game

Lest you think that you might have a few executives who are in this for short-term gain, Alphabet is still run by its co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Together, they -- along with all of the other company executives and board members -- own almost 48 million shares of Alphabet, and account for 60% of the company's voting power. To put the number of shares in perspective, it is equivalent to almost $40 billion at today's prices.

9. The proof is in the culture

Another metric that's often overlooked is a company's culture. If Page and Brin really do want to accomplish the ambitious goals they've laid out, they need a stable and motivated workforce to get things done.

To get an idea for the company's approach, a 2010 filing with the SEC stated that ""[monetary] incentives are secondary to career growth, work environment, and engaging work opportunities. We seek to develop a highly motivated and collaborative workforce that pursues achievements for the sake of progress and innovation before individual gain.""

Based on employee reviews on Glassdoor.com, I'd say the company is doing pretty well.

10. There is lots of cash to make it work

Finally, if you've got a company that's going to be taking lots of small bets that can be costly, it's good to know that management is sitting on a pretty expansive war chest. And that's what you get with Alphabet.

Long-term debt: $3.9 billion

Cash, short-, and long-term investments: $88.8 billion

This, and the other nine reasons above, helps me sleep well at night knowing my family is invested in -- and likely won't sell for a long time -- such a company.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) rallied more than 4% in the first week of trading for 2017, and by so doing, overcame their December 2016 highs. The next major catalyst for the stock is likely to be the earnings announcement on Jan. 26. And looked at through the lens of technical analysis, GOOGL stock is giving us some well-defined price levels to focus around.

When I last discussed Alphabet stock on Dec. 6, I offered that GOOGL could see a pop off important technical support and possibly into year-end for a Santa Claus rally. The very next day, shares took another leg up and reached my near-term price target around $820 just five trading days later.

I still view the month of January to potentially be a tale of two different types of markets. While the first week of 2017 saw a further spillover effect of the late 2016 ""Trump Bump,"" the second half of January will bring about a heavier corporate earnings calendar as well as the presidential inauguration.

Obviously, it is too early to tell how markets will react to these events, but given the sharp rally we have witnessed in stocks over the past two weeks, I don't think it's farfetched to expected at least a little cool-down in stocks over the near- to possibly intermediate-term future.

And GOOGL stock could be one of the victims here.

GOOGL Stock Charts

If we look at the multiyear weekly chart of GOOGL stock, we see that the uptrend in a well-defined pattern (red dotted parallels) remains intact.

However, we also see that shares are now again trading near the very upper end of this channel.



Click to Enlarge

Broadly speaking, stocks tend not to break out of these longer-term uptrending channels for very long before mean-reverting back in. While a breakout of this channel to the upside is certainly not out of question, a successful breakout likely needs a major news catalyst … such as potentially a great earnings and outlook report by Alphabet on Jan. 26.



Click to Enlarge

On the daily chart, we see the bullish reversal that took place in early November and again in early December, which in early December got me to buy the stock for a trade, as discussed above. The technical confluence zone of support around the $750 area remains important through a multiweek/multimonth lens, just as horizontal resistance around the $820 area is important.

Last Friday, GOOGL stock rallied about 1.5% and closed the day and week above $820. If momentum can sustain, then the stock should see $845-$850 before the Jan. 26 earnings report.

From my perspective, I will not be in GOOGL through the earnings report. Instead, I believe the best way to approach Alphabet is to re-evaluate the stock after earnings have passed.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average pulled off the ultimate flirt last week, coming within less than a point of the 20,000 mark on Friday before nestling in just under that record.

As we head into Monday's trade, the Dow Jones will make another run at 20K. Meanwhile, a few blue chips will be in the spotlight thanks to headlines from the weekend, including Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ).

Here's what's happening with these juggernauts:

Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)

Amazon's Alexa voice assistant will now be offered in at least one major automotive company's vehicles .

Volkswagen AG (ADR) (OTCMKTS: VLKAY ) announced that the popular virtual assistant - which is in the Echo speakers and a slate of other voice-activated products announced at CES 2017 - will be used in its vehicles.

Alexa will help Volkswagen owners navigate through their cars' settings and functions in an easier and more convenient manner, taking voice commands and reacting appropriately.

The assistant will be integrated into the company's Car-Net system, which has been around since 2013. Users will be able to connect their cars to smartphones, unlock or locate their vehicle and monitor their speeds with Alexa.

The Amazon product will also inform users if the airbags are about to deploy, it will add destinations to the car's navigation systems, check their fuel levels, lock or unlock their vehicle from home and more.

AMZN stock is up more than 6% in the young year.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL)

Alphabet vehicles will be hitting the road, and soon .

Chrysler Pacificas with Google's self-driving technology will be unleashed onto public roads in late January, the tech giant announced over the weekend at the North American International Auto Show.

Waymo - the Google self-driving project - is producing the technology for the Alphabet product. This means that the company will build its own cameras, sensors and matching technologies.

Lidar sensors will be key to bringing this autonomous driving concept to life, consisting of laser-mapping technology that is more advanced than simply using cameras to monitor the vehicle's surroundings.

GOOG shares are up a little more than 4% so far this year.

Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA)

Tesla is also making moves toward advancing self-driving technology for generations to come, starting today.

The electric car giant tweeted a message Sunday morning, detailing that the company's most advanced autopilot functions will roll out to the entire fleet of TSLA vehicles on Monday.

The software, known as HW2, is already functional in 1,000 cars. It will be unleashed to all other vehicles, but will run in ""shadow mode"" until more data is gathered. Tesla will wait to get a more tangible idea of when the technology will be widely available across its products.

An initial version of the Tesla software was released in active mode last week to 1,000 cars.

TSLA shares are up 7% year-to-date.

When it comes to companies that ""have it going on,"" few are as relevant as Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ). FB practically redefined the term ""social media,"" and set the benchmark for digital networking. Today, if you don't have a Facebook account, you might as well not exist. Roughly a quarter of the global population actively uses its services on a monthly basis, making Facebook stock perhaps the most visible investment ever.

Source: Shutterstock

Yet based on the FB stock price, the good times may be coming to an end - or at least a definite respite. It's not that there's anything disastrously wrong right now. Facebook stock ended the year up nearly 11%.

The company is backed by very strong financials that are the envy of the internet content market. Among the highlights are explosive growth in both the top and bottom line. You couldn't get tighter financials if you tried, but somehow, Wall Street is seemingly unimpressed.

The problem is capital growth. While FB stock produced double-digit returns for the fourth consecutive year - something that the other ""FANG"" stocks Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX ), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) can't say - momentum has slowed down substantially. As a prime example, the boring as cornflakes SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA: SPY ) ended 2016 up over 14%. And since the first of November, Facebook stock is down 5%.

FB Stock Is Too Strong to Fail

Obviously, no asset can sprint indefinitely. Corrections are a natural component of a healthy bull market, which implies great things for the future of Facebook stock.

InvestorPlace feature writer Hilary Kramer nails down the optimistic argument. In her late-December article, she notes that revenue ""is on tap to expand by more than 50% this year, translating to more than 80% earnings growth . Earnings estimates for Facebook stock have been marching steadily higher - always a good sign."" Despite controversies surrounding the FB decision to crack down on ""fake news,"" nothing can upend these enormously positive tailwinds.

Even if conservative users are unhappy - suspicious stories' provenance will be determined by left-leaning media like The Associated Press and The Washington Post - FB stock has one, undeniable trump card. Everybody loves Facebook, and that won't change. Because of this rabid popularity, the company can look forward to continued growth without worry.

Another highly respected voice from InvestorPlace, Lawrence Meyers, concurs. A begrudging analyst towards FB stock, even he admits the financials are fantastic. Meyers writes, ""It has also proven to be a very effective advertising platform , with revenue from each user globally increasing at a rate of almost 40%. That's just incredible. If you crunch all the other data, I see nothing but good news, as we see increasing user engagement and increasing advertiser spend per user.""

Don't Ignore the Warning Signs for Facebook Stock

Yet the question remains - why hasn't Facebook stock picked up on the enormously bullish fundamentals? I think there's more going on than just ""people don't get it.""

In its first full year as a publicly traded entity, FB stock returned a whopping 110%. The following year in 2014, shareholders were rewarded with a robust 41% return; 2015 hit a very mild road bump, netting investors more than 30%. But at 13% in 2016, that's a severe demarcation. Again, you could get better performance blindly picking a basket of companies from the S&P 500 .

But the biggest concern from a nearer-term perspective is the technical warning signs. Ever since a steep drop off on Nov. 3, Facebook stock has formed a bearish pennant formation . This chart pattern is characterized by a sideways consolidation period, followed by a continuation of pessimism.

Indeed, we've already witnessed the impact of bad news towards FB stock. Currently, traders are digesting the overall situation in the markets to determine their next move.

But this ""digesting process"" implies more downside risk yet to be absorbed. Keep in mind that it doesn't necessarily have to be bad news - Facebook stock may simply fail to meet lofty expectations.

Investors should keep in mind, however, that this is an immediate assessment. Like many others have pointed out, Facebook stock is built upon a solid foundation. I would be surprised if this is anything more than a blip lasting at longest a quarter or two.

For those wanting to get on board with FB stock, the best idea here is to wait a little bit. This is an important transitory period for Facebook, which could spell a solid discount for patient buyers.

As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is a stock that's boring, until it's not. In 2012, GOOG stock went up by single digits but then in 2013 it gained almost 60%. Then in 2014, what was then Google stock lost about 3% before gaining another 44% again in 2015 after changing its name to Alphabet along the way.

In 2016, Alphabet Inc. was up by about 8% to lag the overall stock market. So will the past trend hold, and will 2017 be a breakout year?

There are fair arguments on both sides. After all, the high-growth days of Google are behind it after the internet giant has matured to a nearly $600 billion company. Also, rival Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) is now its peer in both its reach and its relationship with digital advertisers. On the other hand, bulls who like GOOG stock or GOOGL like its track record of consistent growth and innovation over the years.

So who's right? Here's a look at both sides of the trade with three pros and three cons to investing in Alphabet stock right now.

Pros of GOOG Stock

Growth : While the company restructured into Alphabet in 2015, Google advertising remains the biggest part of its business. And that business is good, judging by overall revenue growth of 19% this year and a projected 16% growth rate next year. Furthermore, profits will be up 16% this year and 19% next year. With continued success from its core, Alphabet can afford to look into new efforts without worrying about financial performance.

Valuation : Despite a strong history of success and projections of future growth, GOOG stock is not overvalued. Right now, shares trade for around 20 times forward earnings. That is on par with forward P/E of about 19 for the typical stock in both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 . If you can get a fair price for a high-growth company like this, you should take it.

Innovation: With a fair current price and hopes of future growth, there's a lot to like about Alphabet Inc. right now. But with constant innovation into new areas, including a ""smart"" contact lens that can read your blood sugar or Google Fiber high-speed internet access, there is a whole lot of future potential from GOOG stock.

Cons of GOOG Stock

Investors Still Waiting for Next Big Thing : In a 2016 research report, Bernstein's Carlos Kirjner pointed out that Alphabet's average return on invested capital ""has declined steadily for the last 4-5 years"" as the product pipeline has failed to yield the big success of past years. Yes, Alphabet is trying to innovate with things like self-driving cars … but Uber is standing toe-to-toe with it anyway. Yes, Google is pushing a subscription based YouTube Red … but it's late to the game, behind Netflix, Inc . (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) with its Prime Instant Video offerings. Investors waiting for the next big thing, then, may have to wait for some time.

Over-reliance on Google: While Google ad revenue is looking good right now, there is a big risk in parent Alphabet Inc relying on this unit for literally 99% of its revenue and 100% of its profits. When you take this over-reliance alongside the lack of ""other bets"" paying off and the declining return on invested capital, the future doesn't look quite as rosy for GOOG stock.

Unrealistic Earnings Expectations : Perhaps most damningly in the short-term, the company posted very strong quarterly earnings back in October 2016. However, despite beating on both the top line and the bottom line, shares actually dropped 5% across the next 30 days even as the broader stock market went on a tear in November. As we approach another important earnings report, remember this performance because it could hint that investors are bidding up Alphabet Inc now but expecting to promptly sell it after the latest numbers hit Wall Street.

Developed in partnership with Ainemo, a hardware technology company in China, this assistant will allow users to use video chat, play music and request on-demand services such as buying movie tickets or controlling smart home devices. This product is similar to Amazon's Alexa and Google Home virtual assistant. However, given that these companies are currently focused on the U.S. and Baidu is developing this family robot for China, we believe the company can get an early mover's advantage in the Chinese home assistant market. The intelligent virtual assistant market size is expected to exceed $ 11 billion by 2024 , according to a research by Global Market Insights, Inc. While use of robots in industries is becoming common in China, the home robot market is still at a nascent stage. Through its latest venture, Baidu is ensuring that it gets a strong holding in this market with an early mover's advantage.

China's Smart Home Market Likely To Reach $23 Billion By 2018

According to a recent report, the smart home market in China holds strong potential and is likely to reach $23 billion by 2018. While international players are yet to enter the region, local companies are already developing products to attract technology savvy Chinese consumers. A product similar to Amazon's Echo was launched by Beijing's Ling Long Co., which is a joint venture between JD.com and iFlyteck. Building a voice-based virtual assistant is challenging in China, given the dialects and accents associated with the Mandarin language. However, Baidu might be able to handle this challenge better with its focus on artificial intelligence. Baidu's Deep Speech 2 has superior voice recognition abilities as it leverages the power of cloud computing and machine learning to create a neural network. In simple terms, neural networks are machines that learn and this technology works well in solving the challenge of voice recognition when the language has several dialects and accents. With this advanced technological capability Baidu will have the edge in the home assistant market and can gain a significant share in this potentially high growth market.

Whether Baidu will expand its ""Little Fish"" outside of China remains to be seen. However, it is well poised to capture the Chinese home automation/voice based personal assistant market.

CES 2017 is now winding down, but last week T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS) CEO John Legere held a press conference at the annual tech extravaganza. In it, Legere made eight bold predictions of what the telecommunications industry might have in store for 2017, and also subsequently penned a blog post on T-Mobile's site.

Let's go through Legere's calls and see what they could mean for investors.

1. No more cable company MVNOs

Mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), which buy wholesale capacity from the major network operators and resell service under a different brand, have always occupied a tenuous place within the mobile value chain. Facing sluggish landline growth, many cable companies have looked toward establishing MVNOs for some exposure to wireless growth. For instance, Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA) announced plans late last year that it would launch an MVNO on Verizon 's(NYSE: VZ) network in 2017, supplemented by Wi-Fi hotspots.

Legere doesn't think these MVNO ambitions will play out well for anyone, and the Un-carrier will not ink any MVNO agreements with cable operators.

2. Google goes big

There are a few candidates for tech giants that may look to jump into the wireless sector, but Legere thinks Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google is the most obvious pick. Of course, the search giant launched Project Fi in 2015, which is a sort of hybrid MVNO that uses several networks (including T-Mobile's) in conjunction with Wi-Fi hotspots. Google is experimenting with and pioneering several interesting ideas, such as prorated data fees.

Thus far, Project Fi has been limited to a small number of devices, mostly Nexus and Pixel phones, but Google has the groundwork in place if it wants to make a bigger impact.

3. TV goes (more) mobile

Over-the-top (OTT) streaming services are proliferating in lockstep with cord-cutting, and Legere sees the shift to mobile accelerating. The chief executive notes that a third of TV watching occurs on devices other than TVs. By the end of 2017, he believes that the majority of TV viewing will be delivered via mobile.

Roughly 61% of mobile traffic is video, and this should jump to 77% by 2020, according to CTIA. T-Mobile delivers quite a bit of (downscaled) video for free via its Binge On program, so it only benefits financially from this increased usage if consumers pay extra for high-resolution streams or opt out of Binge On.

4. Say goodbye to DISH

DISH Network has been sitting on unused spectrum for years, fueling speculation that it would jump into the wireless world. Legere is calling for ""the end of DISH as we know it"" this year, saying it will cease to be a stand-alone entity. DISH's TV business has been on the decline, also a victim of cord-cutting, for quite some time. The company lost 116,000 net TV subscribers last quarter, and currently has about 13.6 million subscribers left.

5. Ridiculously fast LTE

T-Mobile recently noted that it is already approaching gigabit LTE speeds, thanks to its ongoing investments in spectrum and LTE infrastructure. Other carriers are hoping for gigabit speeds on 5G, but Legere says T-Mobile will be there first using existing technologies. Of course, hitting peak theoretical speeds is quite different than what average consumers experience, and most users won't see gigabit speeds in real-world performance anytime soon. T-Mobile reached 979 Mbps in its labs, using a combination of technologies and an unreleased handset.

6. More people will watch him cook

Legere hosts a live-streamed video segment on social media every Sunday under #SlowCookerSunday. Currently, about 500,000 viewers tune in to watch him cook each week, and he predicts he'll have 1 million weekly viewers by the end of 2017. Legere uses his segment as an example of the rise of OTT content, which continues to threaten cable channels.

7. C-suite shakeups

This is a pretty bold one, but Legere predicts that three of the four CEOs of the current major wireless operators will be out by year's end. That's an ambitious forecast not only because that's a lot of CEOs losing their jobs, but also because of the ongoing consolidation speculation that T-Mobile isn't exactly downplaying . If T-Mobile ends up merging with Sprint , Legere would immediately score at least one point on this one.

8. Speculating on speculation

Pointing to the deterioration in both Verizon's and Comcast's core businesses, Legere says that the two telecom giants will be ""forced"" to entertain the idea of a blockbuster megamerger that would combine ""two of the most hated brands in America."" Note that Legere doesn't believe a deal will be officially announced or closed, but rather the pair would have ""discussions."" Seeing as how discussions of this nature often leak and spur speculation, Legere is essentially speculating on speculation. In fairness, the idea isn't out of the question altogether, given AT&T 's recent moves.

Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) always seems to be ahead of the curve, but in recent weeks the company has made a tidal wave of advances showing off the strides it's made.

In December, it unveiled the first Amazon Go location, a convenience store without cashiers or checkout lines where cameras and artificial intelligence recognize what you take off the shelves and charge your account accordingly.

Also last month, the company successfully made its first ever drone delivery, carrying popcorn and a Fire TV device to a customer in rural England, a trip from click to delivery that took just 13 minutes.

Last week, reports emerged than Amazon was planning to launch its own private label athleisure line, challenging Lululemon athletica and other such clothing makers as it takes further steps into the apparel industry.



and other such clothing makers as it takes further steps into the apparel industry. Amazon gained a patent for something resembling an airborne warehouse that would serve as a docking station for drones. The warehouse, envisioned as something like a blimp, would be able to move near events such as sports games, where it could make drone deliveries to fans.

Of all of Amazon's innovations, the airborne warehouse and the system of drones to go with it seems to be the most fantastical. The tech giant envisions the blimp hovering at an altitude of 45,000 feet, from which the drones could make deliveries of game-related merchandise or food. Amazon has filed hundreds of patents in its history, and just because it's patented such an airborne fulfillment center doesn't mean it will become reality. However, Amazon is committed to making drone delivery a core component of its business.

Taking over the skies

Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos went on 60 Minutes in December of 2013 to show off his company's Prime Air program, or what it calls drone delivery. Though it took more than three years since then for the first delivery to happen, the company has taken significant steps toward a future based on drones.

Amazon envisions a world where most of its deliveries take place via drone. Its current fleet can handle packages of up to five pounds, which accounts for 80-90% of its shipments. According to Deutsche Bank , widespread drone delivery could cut the cost of retail goods by as much as half, dramatically transforming the retail industry as it could eliminate the need for most stores.

As Amazon recently demonstrated, it's capable of performing drone deliveries, but regulatory hurdles still stand in the way in much of the world. The company has had success before in bending government rules, convincing the US Postal Service to deliver its packages on Sunday and persuading the Federal Aviation Administration to allow use of electronic gadgets like Kindles end-to-end on flights.

Now, Amazon is again hammering out new rules with the FAA, but thus far the agency has not permitted such unmanned deliveries. Under current stipulations, drones must remain within view of the pilot, making delivery currently unfeasible.

That explains why Amazon has focused on the UK and other countries such as Australia and France for its initial testing.

Amazon isn't the only company focused on drones. Rivals, including Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Wal-Mart , have been investing in the aerial technology as well. Wal-Mart is testing drones to assist with inventory at its warehouses, using the flying machines to track and manage merchandise. It's a move bankruptcy attorney Isaac Marcushamer, who studies industry disruption, said is one of many move designed to keep pace with Amazon, much like its $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com.

Meanwhile, Alphabet's own drone initiative, Project Wing, hit some roadblocks recently as two executives left the division and Starbucks pulled out of a food delivery test. Alphabet aims to create a food delivery marketplace where customers can order delivery by drone from the likes of Domino's Pizza or Chipotle for $6.

With Amazon Go, Alexa, AWS, and other innovations, Amazon has a track record like no other company in innovating new business and using them for competitive advantage. It's the company that stands to gain the most from drone delivery and has put the biggest effort into it, so it's therefore likely to be the leader in the future.

Industry insiders say regulations are the biggest obstacle right now, and envision drone deliveries becoming commonplace in five or ten years. While we may never see an airborne blimp as a delivery hub, the momentum in drone delivery is fast gaining speed. Pretty soon, it may be inevitable.

“I believe it will. We have every reason to believe it will continue,” said Schmidt, a software engineer who is the executive chairman of Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google.

Schmidt expressed confidence that the unsalaried work of the board would continue while acknowledging that he has received no assurances as yet from the Trump transition team or from retired Marine Gen. James Mattis, Trump’s choice for defense secretary.

The forecast for the continuation of the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental, or DIUx, another creation of outgoing Defense Secretary Ashton Carter, is less certain. DIUx was set up last year with the goal of speeding the process of getting new technology from “non-traditional sources” into the hands of warfighters

The National Defense Authorization Act passed by Congress and signed by President Barack Obama limited funding for DIUx, and Pentagon officials said its future would be in question in the new administration.

However, DIUx has a defender in retired Adm. William McRaven, the former head of U.S Special Operations Command and a member of the Defense Innovation Board. At the board’s meeting Monday, McRaven, who organized the raid that killed Osama Bin Laden, said that keeping DIUx “seems like a no-brainer.” He called the creation of DIUx “one of the great decisions of Secretary Carter.”

While stating that the Defense Innovation Board would likely continue into the next administration, Schmidt was less sure that all of the current board members would agree to stay.

“I have indicated I would be very happy to serve under [the Trump administration], and I believe all, or everyone but maybe one, will continue” on the board, said Schmidt, who was a major contributor to Obama’s election campaigns.

“I’m just assuming one or two might choose [to leave], but I don’t know. My current expectation is everyone would stay on. No one has told me they are leaving, but it’s also the case no one has been asked by the new administration to stay because the new administration doesn’t exist yet,” Schmidt said.

Board members Neil deGrasse Tyson, an astrophysicist and director of New York City’s Hayden Planetarium, and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman have been critical of Trump.

Both Hoffman and Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder who was criticized by Trump during the campaign, were not at the board meeting Monday. Tyson was present and indicated that he would stay.

“All the carefully selected quotes that you find in these halls [of the Pentagon], they pledge allegiance to the Constitution,” Tyson said. “And I have yet to see a quote that talks about the president. So I think there is a higher mission statement that we all live by here.”

Carter set up the Defense Innovation Board last April, and the board met for the first time to consider recommendations in October. Carter then approved three recommendations to create the post of chief innovation officer at DoD, boost the number of “cyber recruits” in the military and set up a DoD center on artificial intelligence and machine learning.

However, a multitude of factors affect the ROE, which is unequivocally the most popular profitability ratio, and digging through them in detail is a must before arriving at any conclusion. View our latest analysis for Alphabet

Breaking down ROE — the mother of all ratios

ROE is one of the most popular ratios to calculate the profitability of a company. The ratio is arrived by putting net earnings in the numerator and shareholders’ equity in the denominator. Generally, an ROE of 20% or more is considered highly attractive for any investment consideration. Although, it’s more of an industry-specific ratio as the constituents share similar risk profile.

Return on Equity = Net Profit ÷ Shareholders Equity

No matter how high or low return a company generates on equity, it should be more than the cost of equity for value creation. For GOOGL, the cost of equity estimate comes at 10.92% based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model using the current risk free rate and a levered beta to account for financial leverage. That compares to Alphabet’s 15.2% ROE.



ROE can be broken down into three ratios using the Dupont formula. The profit margin is the income as a percentage of sales, while asset turnover highlights how efficiently a company is using the resources at its disposal. Increased leverage, primarily through raising debt, is good for a profitable company, but only to the extent it doesn’t make the firm insolvent in a time of crisis.

Dupont Formula ROE = annual net profit ÷ shareholders’ equity ROE = (annual net profit ÷ sales) × (sales ÷ assets) × (assets ÷ shareholders’ equity) ROE = profit margin × asset turnover × financial leverage

A reflection of how net profit margin has affected ROE in the past can be seen in the trend of income and revenue. An investor can gauge a fair estimate of how it’s going to play out in the future by looking at the analysts’ forecasts in the years ahead. Alphabet’s ROA over the past 12 months stood at 9.2% versus the industry’s 8.94%. Although an investor should look at multi-year asset turnover to assess its effect on the latest ROE, a quick comparison with the industry tells him whether it’s acceptable. We use ROA for the comparison as along with sales, used in asset turnover, earnings, used in ROA, are also comparable within the industry.







The last but not the least is the financial leverage. It’s an important ratio as a company can hide its poor operating and asset-use efficiency by increasing leverage. Thus, along with ROE, we should look at the Return on capital, which reflects earnings as a percentage of overall capital employed, including debt. For GOOGL, ROC stood at 16% versus the industry’s 6.78%.

ROE – It’s not just another ratio

ROE is called the mother of all ratios for a reason. It helps gauge a company’s efficiency both through the income statement and the balance sheet, along with telling you how just changing the capital structure of the company can impact perceived return.

With its latest ventures, Amazon is eating into Google's territory, and things may get worse for Google.

Can Alphabet Inc fend off Amazon and deliver better returns to shareholders in 2017?

2016 was not a great year for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and the company's stock price has not moved much in the last twelve months. Although the company generated $17.1B in operating income and $64.2B in revenue through the first nine months of its current fiscal year, the stock only managed to deliver a return of 4.35%, compared to the NASDAQ's 9.79%. That's nowhere near the kind of returns the stock has generated in the past. Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) latest initiatives with Alexa are eating into Google's territory and it appears as if AMZN stock could be a better investment in 2017 than GOOGL Stock. Can Amazon.com, Inc. really dent Alphabet Inc?

Google Losing Out To Amazon In E-Commerce Search

According to a report by BusinessInsider , Amazon is slowly taking a sizeable chunk of Google's search business by becoming the go-to place for e-commerce search. As per the report, ""more than half of people start their search for online shopping on Amazon now, while only 26% use search engines like Google as the starting point"". Google is a search company, which makes more money when a larger number of people use its search engine. Now by losing market share in e-commerce search, Google is taking a hit on its revenue, as it is primarily dependent on search-advertising to generate revenue. The report gives more details about the trend, but what is more worrying for Google is that its e-commerce search-share has halved in last two years, whereas Amazon has gained drastically in the same period ( see image below). This is a serious concern for Google, and it appears as if things are not going to get any better in future. ( See Also: Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL) Next Growth Cycle Is Closer Than You Think)

Alexa To Conquer Google?

Amazon's Alexa, the personal assistant that was launched with the Amazon Echo smart speaker, was a huge hit at CES 2017. This post describes how delightful Alexa is, and how Echo combined with Alexa is designed to make it easier for you to give more of your money to Amazon. At CES 2017 companies like Ford (NYSE:F), Huawei, LG, as well as a number of startups, all unveiled home appliances, phones, cars, and more gadgets with Alexa integration. Alexa even made an unexpected appearance on Google’s Android ecosystem. Chinese smartphone manufacturer Huawei announced that its flagship handset running on Alphabet Inc's Android operating system will come with an app that gives users access to Alexa in the United States.

Amazon Echo has an early lead and plenty of buzz to go with it. The problem here is not that Amazon Echo is the smart speaker to beat for Google Home. There's more to this. There is a belief in the technology industry that such voice-powered digital assistants will replace keyboards and touch-screens as the primary way consumers interact with devices. In the report stated above, analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research considers that this shift is still in its initial stages, and that Google must move swiftly to make its presence felt in this space, to maintain its dominance in internet search, particularly on Android devices. Quoting him from the above report:

“To the extent that voice becomes more important and something other than Google’s voice assistant becomes the most popular voice interface on Android phones, that’s a huge loss for Google in terms of data gathering, training its AI (artificial intelligence), and ultimately the ability to drive advertising revenue”.

The thing is that the bad part doesn't end here for Google. The more Alexa devices that Amazon and its partners sell, the better Amazon does at its core retail business. It is believed that every Echo owner is a customer who is more likely to spend more on books, groceries, music, and movies on Amazon. But that is not the case with Google. Google can sell as many Google Home devices as it wants, but at the end of the day, Google is a search advertising company, not a retail company, and those Google Home devices aren't delivering ads. We all know Google is better at search than Amazon by a huge margin, and the company can still do a lot more with the data gathered on Home devices. The point is that consumers will be spending less time in front of screens and looking at Google's search ads. No matter how good Google's search ads are, it doesn't matter if people aren't seeing them.

Considering the first point stated in the article too, things are not looking any better for Google, going by the direction things are heading in, in computing space. It seems that Google's vulnerability is becoming Amazon's strength. Alexa's swift rise is making life difficult for Google.

In Summary

Putting all the above factors together it is evident Amazon is gaining in Google's territory. Analysts believe Google's decision to debut its voice assistant exclusively on its own hardware might not have gone well with manufacturers. Given Google's plans to scale it across all other devices, the company needs to rethink its strategy. Sergei Burkov, CEO of Alterra.ai, an artificial intelligence company said "" Huge part of an assistant is search. Google is a search company. Amazon is not.” All is not lost for Google, yet, given the strength of its internet search technology, it can certainly catch up with the leader Amazon here. However, a growth investor would be tempted to invest in AMZN stock rather than GOOGL stock in 2017, since Amazon has many things going its way, where as Google has mainly its double-digit revenue growth to boast of. It is also to be noted that Google's Other Bet's have largely shown disappointing results until now which is not the case with Amazon.

In 2012, GOOG stock went up by single digits but then in 2013 it gained almost 60%.

In 2016, Alphabet Inc. was up by about 8% to lag the overall stock market. So will the past trend hold, and will 2017 be a breakout year?

There are fair arguments on both sides. After all, the high-growth days of Google are behind it after the internet giant has matured to a nearly $600 billion company. Also, rival Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) is now its peer in both its reach and its relationship with digital advertisers. On the other hand, bulls who like GOOG stock or GOOGL like its track record of consistent growth and innovation over the years.

So who’s right? Here’s a look at both sides of the trade with three pros and three cons to investing in Alphabet stock right now.

Pros of GOOG Stock

Growth: While the company restructured into Alphabet in 2015, Google advertising remains the biggest part of its business. And that business is good, judging by overall revenue growth of 19% this year and a projected 16% growth rate next year. Furthermore, profits will be up 16% this year and 19% next year. With continued success from its core, Alphabet can afford to look into new efforts without worrying about financial performance.

Valuation: Despite a strong history of success and projections of future growth, GOOG stock is not overvalued. Right now, shares trade for around 20 times forward earnings. That is on par with forward P/E of about 19 for the typical stock in both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100. If you can get a fair price for a high-growth company like this, you should take it.

Innovation: With a fair current price and hopes of future growth, there’s a lot to like about Alphabet Inc. right now. But with constant innovation into new areas, including a “smart” contact lens that can read your blood sugar or Google Fiber high-speed internet access, there is a whole lot of future potential from GOOG stock.

Google today quietly revealed that it will shut down the Hangouts API, preventing new apps from being built and shutting off existing apps on April 25th. There was no blog post about this, just an updated FAQ and email notification to developers active on the API, forwarded to us by one of these devs.

Some examples of experiences that could be built on the API include augmented reality selfie masks, polling and collaborative drawing, like the Scoot & Doodle app. But as Google pushes Duo as its consumer video chat app and relegates Hangouts to the enterprise, it’s dropping the flexibility to build these kinds of experiences.

The email explains that:

“In order to streamline our efforts further, we will be retiring the Google+ Hangouts API that enables developers to build apps for the older version of Hangouts video calls. This API was originally intended to support social scenarios for consumer users as part of Google+, whereas Hangouts is now turning to focus on enterprise use cases. We understand this will impact developers who have invested in our platform. We have carefully considered this change and believe that it allows us to give our users a more targeted Hangouts desktop video experience going forward.”

According to the FAQ, the few exceptions that will still run are the ability to dial into a Hangout via Dialpad and RingCentral, integrations with enterprise chat tools like Slack and Hangouts on Air tools like Toolbox, Control Room and Cameraman. [Correction: Toolbox was made by an independent developer, not Google.]

The Google Hangouts API is a casualty of Google’s fragmented messaging app strategy and the neglect of Hangouts itself. It was one of the first full-featured video chat apps, and it pioneered the AR selfie mask space that Snapchat has now turned into a teenage phenomenon. But by launching multiple siloed messaging apps that don’t talk to each other and forcing the Google+ social layer onto Hangouts, the service fell out of favor.

Now with the API shut down, it’s one-step closer to being just a video version of the traditional business call. That might be more “streamline,” but it’s far from inspiring users to take a second look at Hangouts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(RTTNews.com) - A federal judge has ruled that Paramount Pictures and CBS Studios can go to jury to stop production of Axanar, a crowdfunded Star Trek fan movie.

The judge said that a jury will decide the question of ""subjective substantial similarity"" of Axanar to older Star Trek films and television shows.

U.S. District Court Judge Gary Klausner ruled that Axanar has ""objective substantially similar to the Star Trek Copyrighted Works."" The judge stopped short of declaring the Star Trek holders the victors in the lawsuit and said that the jury can decide whether the film violates copyright infringement.

Paramount and CBS own the copyrights to Star Trek motion pictures and television series respectively and they saw Axanar as a violation of their intellectual property.

The companies' lawsuit was filed almost a year ago, after Alec Peters'Axanar Productions aimed to raise funds on Kickstarter for a prequel to the 1960s Gene Roddenberry television series.

Axanar is a 21-minute YouTube video and a proposed feature-length version that successfully raised more than a million dollars in crowdfunding on Kickstarter and Indiegogo. The forthcoming feature film was touted as a professional-quality Star Trek fan film.

Axanar is the story of Garth of Izar, an obscure character and the legendary Starfleet captain who appeared in a 1969 episode. The film tells the story of Garth and his crew during the Four Years War, the war between the Klingon Empire and the United Federation of Planets.

Judge Klausner ruled that the character of Garth as well as the characteristics of Klingons and Vulcans may be entitled to copyright protection.

In addition, the plaintiffs submitted evidence showing costumes as well as settings such as planets from the Star Trek copyrighted works to be similar to those used by the defendants in Axanar.

The judge also noted that while Axanar argued that the film is not commercial as they would be distributed for free, the defendants stood to gain at least indirect commercial benefit from the viewership boost for the film.

Klausner said that a jury will best answer whether Axanar Productions' actions were the result of reckless disregard for, or willful blindness, to the copyright holders' rights.

Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) had a good 2016. On the calendar year, FB stock gained about 12% to outperform the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 .

But even though FB stock outperformed the broader market, it certainly ended the year on a weak note.

After the last Facebook earnings report in November, the stock softened up thanks in part to disappointing guidance for 2017. Shares are now down about 10% from their October highs even as the stock market has rallied strongly across the same period.

Some are buying Facebook stock on the dip given the strong history of outperformance in this social media giant. Others are fearful that the growth story could be cooling off, and that the future may be more challenging than the past for FB stock.

So what's the score? To help investors decide, here are three pros and three cons about Facebook stock right now.

Pros of Facebook Stock

Consistent Profit Growth: Unlike smaller rival Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR ) that has never turned a profit, and unlike older rival Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) that has seen trouble growing the bottom line in recent years, FB stock consistently generates bigger profits each quarter. Consider that when Facebook's fourth-quarter earnings hit. It should report $4.09 in per-share earnings on the full year - more than triple the $1.29 in EPS for fiscal 2015. And looking forward, 2017 profits are on pace to hit about $5.21 in earnings per share, a 27%-plus increase.

Unrivaled Scale: Facebook has over a billion users. And remarkably, it's still growing with total daily active users rising from 1.01 billion in Q3 of 2015 to 1.18 billion in Q3 of 2016. It's simply amazing to consider that a billion people are on this platform EVERY DAY. This gives the company a lot of stability, but also a lot of growth potential for the future since a small gain in profitability per user can mean a big impact on the bottom line of FB stock.

Long-Term Vision: Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg created a heck of a social network. However, he also has been ambitious about the future with the acquisition of companies, including Whatsapp and Oculus VR, as a way to keep ahead of long-term tech trends. For instance, in 2016 Zuckerberg shared a 10-year roadmap that includes more video, search and messenger capabilities in the next five years … and everything from virtual reality to artificial intelligence in the years beyond that. FB stock may not be the winner in these races, but it will at least be running them as other stodgy tech firms are left in the dust.

Cons of Facebook Stock

Critical Mass: Of course, we've seen this movie before in fast-growing tech stocks that hit a wall. It happened with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO ) after the dot-com days were over, and it has happened more recently to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) after iPhone sales lost momentum. With over a billion users, how much larger can Facebook really get? And with so many ads and distractions crammed into the interface as it is, how much more efficient at monetization can FB stock become?

Unrealistic Expectations: Facebook has powered higher thanks to earnings that have met or exceeded expectations consistently for the past three years or so. But if the rate of growth slows and disappoints, it could get rough in a hurry. All growth names in tech go through this, but thus far FB stock has been on a steady march higher. It can only keep this up for so long before sentiment gets ahead of the numbers and sparks a sell-off.

Challenges to the Core: The most urgent threat to Facebook is that its current cash cow it the platform it began with. Not only are there rival social networks like the soon-to-IPO Snapchat that are gaining steam, but there are also continued concerns about user privacy as well as concern over algorithms populating newsfeeds with unwanted or even downright misleading content. Once a consumer tech brand falls out of favor with users, it's very difficult to win back their trust and interest.

The battle taking place in artificial intelligence, IoT (internet of things), the cloud, the smart home, and various ecosystems for mobile devices, has pitted the usual suspects of Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) against each other. And this year, more than any other year, the stakes are much higher.

The major reason? President-elect Donald Trump's pro-business policies, including his promise to lower corporate taxes, may give tech companies the flexibility they've needed to invest back into their businesses. In 2017 buying back stock won't seem as the best use of capital. Using cash flow for anything other than attempting to innovate and beat the competition will be too risky.

Other than for a couple of trading days last year, during which it was surpassed by Alphabet, Apple has been the world's most-valuable company based on market cap since passing Exxon (XOM) in 2012, thanks to the success of the iPhone. However, since that achievement, including a span during which its generated more money than the U.S. Treasury, there's been questions about Apple's ability to innovate under CEO Tim Cook.

Meanwhile, Amazon has tested drone deliveries and has since filed a patent to build a warehouse in the sky. Google has entered into the race for autonomous vehicles, while Microsoft -- under new CEO Satya Nadella -- has built itself into a dominant cloud company. Apple has since made a watch -- one which it still hasn't disclosed sales figures on. Apple stock rebounded last year, posting some 10% returns, after dipping below $90 after its revenue declined for the first time in decade.

We won't have to wait long to find out which of the four tech giants will take the early lead in 2017. All four companies are set to report their financial results in the next couple of weeks, led by Apple whose numbers are due out on January 24. Apple is coming off the all-important holiday quarter, though reports suggest that the company has recently reduced first-quarter iPhone production by 10%. In other words, a strong Q2 guidance might not be in the cards.

Microsoft and Alphabet will both report on January 26. Microsoft's cloud-first strategy has once-again turned the company into a juggernaut. Shares are trading at tech-bubble highs. For Google, it's all about its advertising metrics. As for Amazon? It already announced record shipments for the holiday quarter. The only question is, will Jeff Bezos focus on growing the company's profit margins or continue to make future investments?

All told, 2017's tech crown won't be decided this month. For that matter, the winner might not be known for several quarters. But one thing is for certain, I'm not willing to bet my own money against any of them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

App developers earned $20 billion in 2016 - up 40 percent from 2015.

Those two points say a lot; $240 million in revenue in a single day is huge. To put that number in some perspective, it equals the revenue that GoPro Inc. (NASDAQ: GPRO ) collected in its entire third quarter. Snap Inc. - the company behind the wildly popular Snapchat app that's prepping for an IPO that could be worth $25 billion - is expected to have generated between $250 million and $350 million in ad revenue in 2016. The whole year.

In other words, the revenue that AAPL generated from App Store sales alone in a single day hit the level that some of the best-known technology companies take an entire quarter (or longer) to reach.

A single-day sales record (especially one set during the holidays) should naturally be taken with a grain of salt. However, the Apple App Store has been on fire for all of 2016.

Apple says App Store revenue for December topped $3 billion. A 40% increase in the amount of money paid out to app developers compared to 2015 indicates strong growth. That's even when accounting for changes to AAPL's App Store terms last summer that saw in-app subscription fees collected by the company drop from 30% to 15% for long-term subscriptions - putting more of the App Store revenue in developers' pockets.

Super Mario Run Helped Drive App Store Revenue

Nintendo Co., Ltd. (OTCMKTS: NTDOY ) certainly helped the Apple App Store's numbers. According to AAPL, its Super Mario Run game was the No. 1 app for downloads globally on both Christmas Day and New Year's Day.

The game was downloaded over 40 million times within just four days of release, and despite only being available in December, it placed in the top 10 most downloaded apps for all of 2016.

App Store Popularity Helps Drive iPhone and iPad Sales

App Store revenue was a big reason why Apple's Services division revenue grew 24% last quarter to hit a record $6.3 billion , making it the second biggest source of revenue for the company after the iPhone. That alone makes the App Store important to AAPL.

The fact that Services was the only division to see growth in the last quarter also underscores its importance.

Super Mario Run helps to illustrate another importance of the App Store. It may have been eclipsed by Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google Play in sheer number of apps, but the Apple App Store still leads when it comes to access to premium apps. Super Mario Run is a perfect example of this effect in action - it's still not available for Android, and Nintendo is only saying that it will hit Google Play sometime in 2017.

The success of the App Store in continuing to attract the best apps (many of them exclusives) helps Apple to sell the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and even Apple TV. Outside of any hardware or operating system preferences, iOS is the platform that gets the best apps.

At a time when Apple has been struggling with sliding sales in its hardware divisions and criticism over new product releases, the App Store is a bright light.

And with record-setting $240 million in app revenue on the first day of 2017, you can bet AAPL hopes the App Store sets the tone for the rest of this year.

As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Products like Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) Echo/Alexa and Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google Home, along with Apple 's(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone/Siri, have become viable platforms to control smart homes. And while only Amazon and Google have an official presence at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), smart-home devices that work with one or more of those platforms (as well as others) were one of the dominant trends at the show.

In fact, the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), which puts on the show, released a new report on the eve of CES saying that smart homes would be the ""most popular means of Internet of Things engagement."" CTA also predicted sales of 29 million units in 2017, a 63% percent increase over 2016.

To make that happen, companies need to deliver devices that meet consumer needs. A new survey from Coldwell Banker Real Estate and Vivint Smart Homes found that there is one feature that a majority of Americans want on their smart-home devices: voice control.

Smart home devices were everywhere at CES 2017. Image source: author.

What does the survey say?

The report showed that more than 7 in 10 (72%) Americans who already have smart-home products controlled remotely by a smartphone, tablet, computer, or separate automatic system within the home itself want voice control. But, only 48% of people who have smart-home devices, the report found, already have voice control capability.

""We're not surprised that so many Americans want to be able to use their voice to control smart home products because it makes for a much more intuitive user experience,"" said Coldwell Banker Chief Marketing Officer Sean Blankenship. "" ... we're hearing directly from our agents that their clients are demanding voice control to make their smart home experience more seamless.""

Parents want voice control, according to the research, and nearly 4 in 5 (79%) of Generation X members have smart-home products but want voice control. That's followed by millennials at 74%, and baby boomers at 63%.

""Last year we announced our integration with Amazon Echo and we've been blown away with how consumers are unlocking the full potential of a voice-controlled smart home,"" said Vivint CMO Jeff Lyman. ""By simply saying aloud what they want to happen with their locks, lights, thermostats and security system, customers spend more time living and less time managing. The experience is pretty magical.""

What are Americans using voice control for?

When it comes to people who have smart homes with voice control and people who want smart homes with voice control, the top use in both cases is entertainment. That was the top use for the former at 57% and the latter at 43%. In both cases, controlling smart lighting was the second choice.

Image source: Coldwell Banker/Vivint.

Why is voice control important?

Most Americans believe that voice control will give them a more intuitive user experience, according to the Coldwell Banker/Vivint report, which was produced by surveying 4,108 U.S. adults ages 18 and older, among whom 923 have any smart home products. ""The most commonly cited benefits for using voice control among respondents were hands-free control at 30%, increased user-friendliness at 17% and flexibility in location at 14%,"" read the study.

Part of the reason Americans want voice control in their smart-home devices is because they are already comfortable with the technology. Of the people surveyed who already have smart-home products, 74% of them said they use voice control on their smartphones.

This is what's coming

While Siri has stumbled at least partly because Apple launched it without tightly limiting its parameters and Google's Assistant has yet to make much of a mark, Amazon Echo shows that people will use voice control at home. Going from asking a digital assistant to tell you the weather or playing a song to having one actually control your home will take some time.

Amazon has taken a smart approach by slowly adding functionality and opening up its Echo/Alexa platform to outside developers. That has given the company a foothold in people's houses that might allow it to expand its presence. Apple, Google, and maybe even a few others have a chance to work their way in as well (and a quick look around at CES shows that dozens, maybe hundreds are trying to get involved in some fashion), but it's very clear that whatever products people select, voice control will have to be a key component.

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is a regular favorite among tech investors, and for good reason. After bottoming out around $10 a share after the dot-com crash, AMZN stock has raced up to a recent high of about $850 a share before pulling back. Had you got out at the top, that would have turned a $1,000 investment in Amazon stock into $85,000.

Of course, Amazon.com has changed a lot over the past 15 years or so. A decade ago, the story was all about e-commerce and how AMZN was killing traditional retailers. Last year, it was all about the rapid growth of Amazon Web Services. Now, its virtual assistant Alexa is all the rage.

But investors in Amazon stock aren't buying the past. They are buying the future. And in 2017, with so much growth behind AMZN stock, it's reasonable to wonder whether it can keep this up.

If you're wondering whether Amazon stock is a buy or a sell here after its big run, here are three pros and three cons to help you decide.

Pros of Amazon Stock

Innovation: Amazon started with a vision to be the world's largest bookstore. It then moved into everything from shoes to flat-screen TVs and now touches every part of retail imaginable. After that, it started cranking out its own Kindle hardware and developed its much-hyped cloud computing arm AWS. Nobody knows what's next from Amazon - drones, perhaps? - but you can be sure this company is not sitting still.

Revenue Growth: With a growth rate of about 28% in fiscal 2016, Amazon's top line is moving higher at a very nice clip But what's really amazing is that the base number is already huge - starting the year at over $100 billion! But lest you think AMZN stock can't keep that rate up, it's projecting over 20% revenue growth again in 2017 despite starting from roughly $130 billion in annual sales. That's simply amazing.

The Sky Is the Limit: As of Q3 2016, fewer than 10% of total U.S. retail sales were e-commerce transactions. And while Amazon is dominant among this with a roughly 51% share , there is plenty of room for it to gain a larger piece of the pie even as the pie keeps growing. This, coupled with the company's ability to branch out into other areas and a will to invest heavily in R&D, means there is literally nothing AMZN stock can't do in the years ahead.

Cons of Amazon Stock

Profit Challenges: One of the biggest catalysts for AMZN stock in the last year or two has been the profitability of Amazon Web Services, which led to a rare stretch of quarterly profits for the tech giant. However, those profits have started to fade again, and a big earnings miss in September 2016 disappointed investors and has largely held the stock back ever since. Founder and CEO Jeff Bezos wants to plow every penny of profits back into the company, but Wall Street may want something different now that it got a taste for actual earnings.

Risk of Retail Hubris: Amazon stock holders and CEO Jeff Bezos think anything goes at AMZN, but remember the flop that was the Fire Phone ? That was a costly boondoggle that ultimately led to the firing of engineers in charge of the project. Right now, Amazon may be making a similar mistake as it jockeys to purchase the defunct American Apparel and opens brick-and-mortar bookstores in New York and elsewhere. Sure, Amazon is dominant … but is it now being unrealistic about where it can compete by entering physical retail?

Unrealistic Expectations: With so much buzz around AWS and Alexa and with such high expectations for its core e-commerce business, it's natural to think disappointment lies ahead. After all, Amazon Web Services was growing revenue at a 78% rate in Q3 2015 and that fell to a much more modest 55% growth rate in Q3 2016 . More is more, yes, but as any momentum investor will tell you it's all about expectations and not the core growth rate. Amazon investors may have unrealistic expectations after 2016, and it will be difficult even for this fast-growing stock to keep up.

It wasn't a good year for Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) in 2016. Sure, it generated $17.1 billion in operating income through the first nine months of its current fiscal year on $64.2 billion in revenue, but at the end of the day GOOGL stock only managed a total return for shareholders of 1.9%.

Source: Brionv via Wikimedia (Modified)

That's on par with its internet content peers, but way off the 12% delivered by the S&P 500 . Not good by Google standards.

Holding GOOGL stock back - a bit of a misnomer considering that it has nearly doubled the return of the S&P 500 over the past five years - is a valuation that InvestorPlace contributor Dana Blankenhorn feels is ""priced to near-perfection"" with a price-earnings ratio of 29 based on a consensus per-share earnings estimate of $26.90 in 2016, $32.25 in 2017 and $36.99 in 2018.

So, analysts expect Alphabet to grow earnings by 17.3% annually over the next two years - that's a two-year PEG ratio of 1.7. By comparison, Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) has a two-year PEG ratio of 1.6 based on annual EPS growth of 29%.

From this perspective, GOOGL stock doesn't look too bad; you have to conclude that either FB is overvalued at this point or GOOGL isn't quite as expensive as people think.

Especially when you consider that there's still gas in Alphabet's tank.

Google Travel Is Fueling GOOGL

Leading the charge is its travel business which has quietly become a key element in Alphabet's success. As the travel vertical prospers, so too does Google and its parent.

According to Dennis Schaal of Skift, Google's travel business will generate an estimated $12.2 billion in advertising revenue in 2016, accounting for 13.7% of Alphabet's projected 2016 revenue of $89.3 billion. Put another way, Google's travel business will generate approximately 1,670% [calculation: $12.2/4 multiplied by 3 divided by Other Bets Q1-Q32016 revenue of $547 million] more revenue in 2016 than its Other Bets segment, which includes much of the innovative work being done by the company, including Nest, Fiber, etc.

On its own, Google Travel would be a pretty large company with operating profits of $3.8 billion. While advertising might be boring, one can't underestimate the importance of this vertical to the company's profitable growth.

And you can forget about Google becoming an online travel agency with this much money on the line. It's not going to cut off its nose to spite the face. It's just not.

""Google's existing revenue from travel advertisers is already considerably larger than that of the Priceline Group Inc (NASDAQ: PCLN ); is roughly twice the size of Expedia Inc's (NASDAQ: EXPE ), and Google generates more travel advertising revenue than that of Expedia, Ctrip (NASDAQ: CTRP ) and TripAdvisor Inc (NASDAQ: TRIP ) combined,"" wrote Schaal in his November 2016 article on the subject. ""Google undoubtedly takes that travel-advertising revenue and achieves a much higher profit margin on it than do the roster of its online travel, airline, hotel, car rental and cruise partners.""

Yes, it's true that Google maintains an uneasy relationship with its advertiser partners, a relationship they sometimes resent, but until they can successfully build a workable alternative , they'll need Google more than Google needs them.

Now consider what the company's doing on the venture capital front. In September, CapitalG (formerly Google Capital) led a late-stage $850 million round of financing of Airbnb that values the private company at $30 billion. Some of the funds raised by the home-sharing service will be used to set up its own flight booking service to compete with some of Google's bigger advertising partners (Priceline, Expedia) in that very competitive segment of the online travel business.

While Airbnb currently spends about $300 million in advertising with Google on an annual basis, you can expect that number to increase once Airbnb gets its second stream of revenue online sometime in 2017.

Utilizing CapitalG to fund opportunities within the travel space that don't put them directly in competition with their advertisers is the key to future success for both the travel vertical and Alphabet itself.

I like GOOGL stock for a lot of different reasons, but its travel business is certainly one of them.

The startup boasts of a technology that has proved to be reliable in removing noise, distortion and echoes, which the tech giant plans to use to improve its conferencing products.

Limes Audio-Hangouts Integration

Terms of the deal remain under wraps, Limes Audio having raised $2.4 million last year in a financing round. In a blog post, the tech giant has confirmed that Limes Audio technology will mostly be integrated into Hangouts and Chromebox for Meetings. With the integration, Limes Audio looks destined to shut down completely even on the app’s founders suggesting that they will continue collaborating with the community going forward.

The acquisition comes at a time when Google has been aggressive in improving video chat in some of its apps. Hangouts and Chromebox are some of the apps that the company is paying more attention to as it looks to make a name for itself with video conferencing. It has also launched a rival to Microsoft’s Skype and Apple FaceTime dubbed, Duo, which boasts of one-to-one video calling capabilities.

Hangouts Sound Quality

Upgrading hangouts sound quality should go a long way in affirming Google credentials on video conferencing an area it has played a secondary role to Microsoft’s Skype.

“As more and more businesses adopt our video conferencing solutions, powered by Chromebox for Meetings and Google Hangouts, it’s critical that we provide a great audio experience. With G Suite customers now relying on video communications for their day-to-day meetings, it’s more important than ever to ensure low-cost, high-quality audio,” said Google Cloud Director of Product Management Serge Lachapelle

Limes Audio acquisition has once again reaffirmed Sweden’s pool of talent that has seen a number of startups acquired in the recent past by tech giants. The startup follows another acquisition a communication company, Marratech that Google acquired for $15 million in 2007 later on followed by data visualization startup Trendalyzer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Though Google is known for online search technology, shopping has been weak, and shrinking: 55 percent of U.S. consumers now start their shopping searches on Amazon, up from 44 percent the prior year, according to a BloomReach survey of 2,000 U.S. consumers over Labor Day weekend. Only 28 percent of respondents said they begin their product search with search engines like Google, down from 34 percent in the year-ago period. Retailers also saw their share of search shrink in 2016.

Capturing more of the growing pool of online shoppers could be a huge opportunity for Google, said Lloyd Wood, who leads enterprise sales at market research firm GfK, a partner of Google.

In CEO Jeff Bezos' annual letter to Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) shareholders from April 2016, he highlighted the company's three pillars: Prime (its $99-a-year membership), Marketplace (where it sells items), and Amazon Web Services (its cloud computing business). All three have been instrumental to Amazon's success over the past decade-plus and Bezos wrote, ""I assure you that we also remain hard at work on finding a fourth [pillar].""

It looks like that fourth pillar could be the Echo smart speaker featuring the Alexa digital assistant.

It's been two years since Amazon unveiled the Echo, which can serve as a hub for other smart-home devices like thermostats and lightbulbs, and its functionality has been extended through third-party ""skills,"" which function like voice-controlled apps. Amazon has the scale and infrastructure necessary to grow the Echo and Alexa into its fourth pillar.

Voice computing is the future

Nobody expects using voice-activated digital assistants will replace using smartphones or desktop computers, not even Bezos. However, there's clearly a growing trend toward using voice search and interacting with digital assistants.

Google recently released a device similar to Echo, Google Home, in order to take advantage of the trend. Additionally, the Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary said voice searches tripled over the last two years.

As the artificial intelligence (AI) powering these devices improves, their usefulness increases. And as they're used more, the AI improves, creating a virtuous cycle.

Another virtuous cycle for Amazon

Amazon has a first-mover advantage in the smart speaker category, and its success with its Kindle line gives consumers confidence in its brand. But Amazon's biggest advantage with the Echo and Alexa is how it can integrate its existing Prime and Marketplace pillars into its Echo business.

One of the primary ways Google is considering monetizing voice searches is through commerce. It recently released a development kit for retailers and service providers to create apps for Google Assistant -- the AI powering Google Home and found in several other Google apps -- to connect with potential customers. Eventually, Google plans to take a cut of sales made through these apps.

But Amazon already has a direct line to customers and a huge marketplace of items -- one of its three pillars. Customers can order products using Alexa, and Amazon will use your order history to figure out what you want or choose an item based on user reviews and pricing. Of course, that feature is only available to Prime members -- urging more customers to sign up for the service. Non-members can still ask Alexa to add items to their cart for checkout later, but they'd have to finish ordering the old-fashioned way and using your fingers to buy stuff online is so 2014.

As such, Alexa serves to support Amazon's Marketplace and Prime and vice versa. Similarly, Prime supports the Marketplace business by increasing customer loyalty and attracting new third-party sellers to the platform. That, in turn, brings more Prime-eligible products to the Marketplace, increasing the value of Prime.

Adding Alexa to the mix strengthens the other two pillars, making it another pillar.

Amazon is really pushing Alexa

Amazon is putting a lot of money behind marketing Alexa. It's been running a television and digital video ad campaign over the last year, including a Super Bowl commercial starring Alec Baldwin. Amazon produced over 100 10-second spots for the campaign based on real-life use cases of the voice assistant.

Most recently, Amazon struck a deal with Wynn Hotels to put an Echo device in each of Wynn's 4,748 Las Vegas hotel rooms. The device will be able to control the lights, temperature, drapes, and TV, with potentially more features to come. It's a clever marketing ploy that will introduce thousands of people to the Echo and allow them to have a firsthand experience using it.

Behind the scenes, Amazon has over 1,000 employees working on Alexa, according to Bezos. He also said the current functionality of Alexa is ""just the tip of the iceberg.""

It's clear from its investments that Amazon sees the huge potential of Alexa. It's not just a stand-alone product, but a potential pillar of its business that supports its other operations -- specifically, Marketplace and Prime.

The Alphabet Inc. unit on Wednesday introduced two new retail partnerships, with BMW and Gap Inc., deploying its 3D-scanning project called Tango. The technology uses cameras and sensors in mobile devices to overlay digital images in physical space – akin to the hit mobile game Pokemon Go. The retail deals announced at the consumer technology show CES in Las Vegas hint at Google’s broader ambition to merge its mapping capabilities with its core business of facilitating commerce.

As virtual- and augmented-reality technology rapidly improves, analysts predict the retail industry may be one the biggest beneficiaries. IDC estimates the market for the technologies will explode from about $5.2-billion (U.S.) in 2015 to $162-billion in 2020. Car dealerships will be “one of the longer-term, more profitable use cases,” said IDC analyst Chris Chute, as auto makers look for way to reach customers who are increasingly less likely to enter traditional outlets.

BMW is testing a new app that displays an i3 city vehicle and i8 sports car on smartphone screens. Car shoppers can walk around the superimposed vehicles, placing it to look life-size inside their driveway or garage. Users can choose from six different colours, four types of trims and wheels, all appearing in a high-resolution image.

The Munich-based luxury auto maker said the mobile app will be available at dealerships in 11 countries. “It’s possible we’ll develop a kind of library of models for this app,” said Stefan Biermann, head of innovations for sales for BMW.

At a recent presentation in Munich, the display image of an i3, even on a small phone screen, was convincing enough for users to duck and lift their legs to step inside the vehicle, where they could push a button to turn on the lights and the radio.

“We see a lot of use of this technology in retail, for measuring your garage or buying big-ticket items like kitchens for example,” Eric Johnsen, who heads business development for augmented reality at Google, said at the event.

Bloomberg News reported earlier that Google plans to use the indoor mapping capability of Tango to generate advertising revenue. Mr. Johnsen said Google isn’t getting revenue from sales with its newly announced partnerships, but declined to comment further on business plans.

On top of the BMW app, Google announced two more developments for Tango on Wednesday. A new app allows shoppers to test clothes from the Gap brand using Tango. And Google added a new hardware partner: The Zenphone from Asustek Computer Inc. is now compatible with Tango’s technology.

However, both announcements reveal the limitations of Google’s efforts. For one, there aren’t many consumers that can try it out. The Asus Zenfone is only the second model to enable Tango, following a device from Lenovo Group Ltd.

And it’s still incomplete for consumers that try the technology. With the mobile app for Gap, for instance, shoppers try on outfits using a 3D digital avatar, rather than superimpose the clothes on their bodies. The latter tactic might arrive eventually, but the tech needed is still in its infancy.

“Producing content for these mediums is extremely hard,” said Shanna Tellerman, founder of Modsy, a startup that uses three-dimensional technology for e-commerce. “It often looks a little bit janky.”

Google is aware of the problem. In addition to challenges with realistic rendering, mobile 3D mapping is constrained by difficulties imposed by lighting and geographic space, said Johnny Lee, director of engineering for Tango. The gap between expectations of the technology and its reality can do more harm than good.

“When people think about augmented reality, they think of science-fiction quality effects,” he said.

That’s also the rationale behind Google’s cautious implementation of Tango on devices, Mr. Lee explained. While the company ultimately plans for the tech to function inside every mobile device, it now doesn’t reach a vast majority of Android smartphones.

Hardware changes demanded from Tango’s sensors also may give Google’s manufacturing partners pause. However, that might change if the tech becomes ubiquitous. Other software companies – Microsoft Corp., Facebook Inc. and Snap Inc. – are investing heavily in augmented and virtual reality. Apple Inc. hasn’t revealed any plans for AR, but CEO Tim Cook has touted the technology publicly multiple times. It’s unlikely Apple would allow Google’s Tango to operate on its iPhones.

E-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc. is certainly thinking about virtual reality shopping too, said Mr. Chute, the IDC analyst.

All these companies, however, must grapple with the dual challenge of mastering the necessary tech and, more critically, finding an actual market.

“Hardware ain’t easy,” Mr. Chute said. “What works in a closed environment, in (Silicon) Valley, doesn’t necessarily work in the real world.”

The latest figures from the Interactive Advertising Bureau show that the third quarter last year was the biggest ever, with a total of $17.6 billion spent on digital ads. That's a 20% increase from the same period a year earlier, thanks to growth in mobile and video. This growth ""reflects marketers' trust in the internet’s power to connect with today’s audiences,"" the IAB said.

If you look beneath the surface, however, it also reflects the fact that a majority of those audiences are controlled by Google ( goog ) and Facebook ( fb ) —and if anything, their control is accelerating.

Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.

Last year, Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser estimated that digital advertising revenue in 2015 also soared by 20% from the previous year to a record of $60 billion. Close to 65% of that went to Google and Facebook, he said, with the search giant taking $30 billion and Facebook taking $8 billion.

""Smaller companies will continue to operate in the shadows of the industry’s two dominant players,"" Wieser told investors in a research note at the time.

Halfway through last year, Jason Kint of the advertising trade group Digital Content Next looked at the total ad revenue booked by those two companies as a proportion of the overall industry, and found that they accounted for about 90% of all the growth in the business.

Last week, Kint updated those figures, and the picture they paint has become even more bleak. Based on the IAB's numbers and public financial numbers from Google and Facebook, the two digital giants accounted for about 99% of the $2.9 billion in advertising growth in the third quarter—with Google making up about 54% of the total and Facebook about 45%, leaving just 1% for everyone else.

This duopoly control has had an increasing impact on the advertising-tech market as well, something that used to be a growth area both for publishers and for ad networks. According to a recent analysis by the Financial Times , both the number of financing deals and the amount raised by ad-tech companies has declined sharply in the past year.

The number of ad-tech companies raising money dropped 17% last year compared with the year earlier, data from CBInsights shows, and the total volume of funding fell 33% to $2.2 billion from $3.2 billion, putting it back where it was in 2013.

""Ad tech’s struggle as a sector is absolutely to do with the dominance of Facebook and Google,"" Balderton Capital venture partner Suranga Chandratillake told the FT . ""Ultimately advertising is about selling attention, and if most of that attention is focused on Google and Facebook, then naturally they can monetize it."" He added:

""Even if you manage to build a sustainable advantage for a few years, how do you scale to compete with Google or Facebook? That’s why traditional adtech does feel dead from a venture perspective.""

In a recent interview with ad industry veteran Jay Sears, Pivotal's Wieser said the digital-media industry has effectively become a giant duopoly in which Google and Facebook win almost everything, advertisers have to play by their rules, and other media companies ""fight for the scraps.""

New York-based venture investor Fred Wilson, meanwhile, predicted in a forecast for 2017 that ""the ad:tech market will go the way of search, social, and mobile as investors and entrepreneurs concede that Google and Facebook have won and everyone else has lost."" It will be nearly impossible to raise money for an online advertising business in 2017.""

This is how modern political advertising works:

In the past, digital advertising may have been seen as an add-on or supplement to traditional advertising markets, but that is no longer the case. According to estimates from eMarketer, spending on digital ads in the U.S. will likely grow this year to the point where it is larger than the amount spent on television, the former Goliath of the industry.

Data on users and their preferences and behavior is the Holy Grail for most advertisers, and the reality is that Google and Facebook have orders of magnitude more data than their nearest competitors, and more ways to slice and dice it.

In the case of Facebook, the company has more than 1.5 billion users—far more than any other single media business commands—and it tracks what they see and click on in ways that most media companies can only dream of. And that means advertisers will continue to work with them even when they admit that their data was wrong, as Facebook has several times .

Twitter and Snapchat are trying to compete on the same playing field as Google and Facebook, but both remain bit players so far. So is the future for media companies simply one of deciding which of two giant walled gardens they wish to build a majority of their business on, or pay rent to? For the moment, at least, that appears to be the case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the past year, Google has invited more than 60 people to try Tilt Brush and offer feedback, and this week the company is unveiling their work and participation. “You would never want to create an artistic tool with only engineers,” said Mr. Skillman. “That’s just absurd.” According to Tory Voight, Google’s Tilt Brush program manager, those who have joined this artists-in-residence program include Dustin Yellin, a Brooklyn artist known for his 3-D collages encased in layers of glass, and Jonathan Yeo, a British painter whose portrait of Kevin Spacey as the fictional American president Francis J. Underwood was exhibited last year at the Smithsonian Institution’s National Portrait Gallery.

Jeff Koons, whose art works have sold at auction for as much as $58 million, had early access, though he was not part of the artists in residence program. Bob Mankoff, Roz Chast and other cartoonists for The New Yorker have also checked it out, as has Alex Hirsch, the young animator behind Disney’s hit television series “Gravity Falls.” Last June, Mr. Hirsch posted a sample creation on Twitter along with an enthusiastic status update: “Drawing in virtual reality makes you feel like a world-devouring wizard god!”

But the first to try it was Glen Keane, a near-legendary figure who in his 37 years at Disney had brought the warmth of hand-drawn animation to such characters as Ariel (in “The Little Mermaid”), Aladdin, Tarzan and Pocahontas.

“When I left Disney in 2012,” Mr. Keane said recently in his studio, a vintage bungalow on a quiet residential street in West Hollywood, Calif., “I told them it was because I know there’s something new coming — I don’t know what it is, but I need to leave to find it.”

He was still looking when he met Regina Dugan, then the leader of Google’s secretive Advanced Technology and Products group, which was experimenting with virtual reality. First he partnered with the group to make a hand-drawn virtual reality short called “Duet,” a charming piece released in 2014 about two babies growing up that was shortlisted for an Academy Award. “Duet” broke new ground, since animation in virtual reality had almost exclusively been computer-generated. But though he’d spent a lifetime drawing on paper, Mr. Keane had always dreamed of being able to make the paper disappear. “The goal would be to animate not on paper but in space,” he said.

Enter Tilt Brush, which Mr. Keane encountered when Mr. Skillman introduced himself at a visual effects conference in San Francisco. Though still in a primitive state, it was maturing rapidly, and Mr. Keane soon became a convert. In September 2015, seven months before its release, he previewed its capabilities with “Step Into the Page,” a five-minute video. “The edges of the paper are no longer there,” he exclaimed in a voice-over as he did a loose, freehand sketch of Ariel in virtual space. “This is not a flat drawing. This is sculptural drawing.”

Scott McCloud, the graphic artist whose book “Understanding Comics” is considered the ultimate guide to the art form, got to play with Tilt Brush when Google invited him to its Silicon Valley headquarters in August. “I don’t mind saying, I’m a little bit obsessed with this program,” he said as we sat in his small, book-crammed office in a mall in the Los Angeles exurb of Thousand Oaks. “One thing that appeals to me the most is, it’s still very early. Everyone is asking fundamental questions. We’re still trying to figure out what people are going to use it for. I love it when technology is in that stage.”

So, what are people going to use it for? Mr. McCloud threw out a few suggestions: performance art, virtual sculpture, industrial prototyping. “I doodle with it,” said Mr. Yeo, the painter, who spoke by telephone from London. “I describe it as a three-dimensional sketchbook.” What it won’t produce is anything resembling comics as they currently exist in the medium some call “Flatland.”

For denizens of Flatland who have learned to work within the constraints of 2-D, this can be problematic. Mr. Mankoff, the cartoon editor at The New Yorker, came up with some characteristically Mankoff-like 3-D drawings during the two days he spent using Tilt Brush with Ms. Chast and other colleagues at Google’s New York offices. But though he professes to have enjoyed the experience, he seems unlikely to lead The New Yorker out of Flatland. “You’ll probably find a sharp divide between older and younger cartoonists,” he said. “Or it may just not work — but that’s no reason not to try it.” One suggestion the New Yorker team had: cubes and cylinders and other ready-made shapes to draw on, “so you’re not starting from zero in 3-D space.” (Google has since implemented a similar idea.) Other than that, Mr. Mankoff offered with a grin: “The advice I would have for Google is, more cats. You can’t go wrong with cats.”

Mr. Keane has a different item on his wish list. Currently, works created in Tilt Brush are as motionless as a New Yorker cartoon. They’re essentially static, and Mr. Keane is an animator. “To me, the thing to conquer is to be able to animate in real time in space,” he said as I viewed a Tilt Brush drawing called “Victory Dance” in his studio. The piece captures a brief moment in time, seconds after his daughter’s high school choir had won a national championship — but it begs to be brought to life.

“Just like you have a spatial dimension, you’ve got to have time as a dimension,” Mr. Keane continued. “There’s no reason you can’t do that. I’m not smart enough to figure it out. But Drew is.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My preconceived notion when putting this piece together was that demand for Fitbit Inc's (NYSE: FIT ) wearable fitness devices and accessories have peaked for good and that Fitbit stock, which was down sharply throughout most of 2016, had little investment appeal. Yet sales should be up this year, and FIT is optimistic for its sales levels during this all-important holiday season.

Source: Via Fitbit

It also seems logical that consumers will eventually ditch wearable devices and turn to apps in their mobile devices.

In theory, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) should be able to put Fitbit out of business. Yet, there appears to be a select group that is interested in daily fitness, and athletes will likely always be interested in any information that helps them perform best and compete at a high level.

Is It All Bad News for Fitbit Stock?

FIT is also developing products for what it terms a healthcare ecosystem. In its words , it aims to ""comprehensively monitor and effectively engage patients and consumers to drive better health outcomes."" Health and fitness tracking is likely to remain as important as ever, and could develop into a multi-billion dollar business for wearable device firms such as FIT.

Cash flow trends aren't encouraging at all. In 2016 (through Sept. 30), Fitbit has been a net spender of its cash. By this period in 2015, it had generated $125.5 million in operating cash flow and only spent $17.7 million on capital expenditure. This year operating cash flow only totaled $40.2 million and capex had grown to $66.8 million, meaning negative free cash flow.

Yet management expects a healthy holiday season to bring in sales and profits and boost total cash on hand from about $672 million currently to between $900 million and $950 million by the end of the first quarter of 2017. This is when all the cash will come in from the holiday sales. That could bring total cash to nearly $4 per diluted share, or just over half of the current share price of $7.95 per share.

For the full year, sales are expected to grow as much as 26% to $2.3 billion. This is based off the 20 analysts currently following Fitbit stock. This group expects a modest 3% boost to $2.4 billion during 2017, but that is subject to change. Earnings estimates for FIT stock are at $0.58 per share this year, and $0.66 next year.

The problem with earnings is forecasts have come down significantly. Just 90 days ago, analysts expected earnings of well over $1 per share for each of the next two years. Based on the decreases, there is little surprise Fitbit stock has fallen from $30 per share to the single-digit level currently.

It remains to be seen if Apple, or Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Android platform will develop apps that increasingly compete with Fitbit's wearable devices. It is clearly more convenient to carry one device over two, though highly active people don't probably carry a phone while working out. Yet, more advanced data from wearable fitness devices could grow much more specialized than what a phone can provide.

With FIT stock's current price and valuation (less than 13x earnings estimates), because of the share-price fall, the company's investment picture is now quite interesting. It has no long-term debt, so it is in a great financial position. Fitbit stock is still generating cash flow and profits. In its recent earnings call, management touted that it has sold 28 million devices since going public and $2.7 billion in sales.

FIT also mentioned , ""healthcare and insurance industries are starting to embrace our products and services."" To me, this is the real potential in Fitbit stock. Earlier in December, FIT and medical device giant Medtronic PLC (NYSE: MDT ) announced a partnership to track the glucose levels of patients with diabetes. Medtronic's iPro2 CGM device will integrate data from Fitbit's activity devices.

The Bottom Line on FIT Stock

Of course, it is going to take time for any tangible results from the healthcare and insurance initiatives to take hold. For the time being, consumer demand for Fitbit devices appears to be tepid at best. Management is working through some higher inventory levels, and it appears that existing sales are much less profitable than they were several years ago for FIT stock.

For now, Fitbit stock investors might want to wait for the sales results from Black Friday, the Christmas shopping season and the promotional period following the holidays. However the share price is low, and there aren't really any ambitious growth levels baked into FIT stock.

It might not be a bad strategy to nibble into Fitbit stock at current levels, and average in if sales come in weak from the holidays and the share price falls any further. But regardless of the short-term strategy, an investment in FIT stock will require a long-term perspective, to see if it is able to profitability deliver on its mission of helping ""people lead healthier lives by empowering them with data, inspiration and guidance.""

As of this writing, Ryan Fuhrmann did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Good news for those of you who like, and use, the 1-click purchase tool provided by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) - the company's patent on the utility is set to expire this year, meaning other companies will soon be able to make it super-easy to buy pretty much anything on the web.

Source: Via Amazon

It's superficially bad news for owners of AMZN stock, of course, as the tool facilitated revenue that may not have otherwise materialized if a shopper was forced to work through a two-stage (or more) process to make said purchase.

Although no empirical evidence of the benefit of 1-click has been offered, many say the technology has facilitated billions of dollars worth of incrementally more business for the e-commerce giant.

That said, while Amazon's impending loss of patent protection on the business process could be troubling to AMZN stock owners, a closer, critical look at 1-click suggests it's not just the function/feature that kept Amazon.com's digital competitors at a disadvantage.

AMZN: E-commerce Made Easy

The value of 1-click is mostly an arbitrary one. A few years back CEO and Co-Founder of Rejoiner Mike Arsenault used a working figure that suggested the technology was responsible for 5% of the company's sales, while Forbes contributor Ian Morris recently came up with a more specific suggested value of $2.4 billion.

Although there's no great way of quantifying its value and impact, the patent does lend itself to a qualified assessment.

Anyone who has ever made a purchase of any kind on the web knows it can be a bit of a pain. Not only must payment details be entered at the time of purchase, but shipping instructions must also be added. Too much hassle during the procedure (called ""friction""), and would-customers abandon their efforts to buy something online before the transaction is completed. Specifically, a collection of tech companies estimate the ""abandoned"" web-based shopping-cart rate to be about 68%.

What if, however, a consumer could simply click one button in their browser, and boom - it's done? That's what 1-click does.

And it matters, if the rise of the iTunes store from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is any indication.

The growth of iTunes has largely been credited to its license to use Amazon's 1-click platform. Steve Jobs knew years ago the key to the digital content site's success was making it stunningly easy for consumers to spend. Apple licensed Amazon's technology in 2000, after the patent was issued to Amazon in 1999, and saw its digital content business soar from practically nothing to a $6.3 billion business by 2011 .

Sure, the advent of the iPhone helped, but one could argue that 1-click also helped popularize the iPhone as a way to consume digital content.

There's a subtle-but-significant fly in the ointment of the theory that Amazon's smashing success relied on 1-click and that competitors will eat its lunch once its patent protection is gone, however. AMZN stock owners should be thrilled.

1-Click Is Only Part of the Amazon Stock Success Story

As difficult as it may be to determine how much of the 4,800% gain Amazon stock has dished out since the end of 2000 is solely attributable to 1-click, it would be short-sighted to ignore another key fact of the matter. That is, all of those users were or became AMZN customers for reasons other than 1-click.

Giving credit where it's due, it was Econsultancy's David Moth who recognized years ago that easy online payments was only one pillar in Amazon's growth, particularly after mobile became the new norm.

For starters, Moth points out that AMZN was one of the first major names to develop a mobile-specific e-commerce website, syncing that shopping cart up with the same user's desktop shopping-cart (if logged in at the same time). He also recognized - and this is big - that Amazon's call-to-action screens are simply more compelling than its competitors' pages.

Perhaps the most significant factor of all, though, is that Amazon actually sells almost any product you can think of , making it easy to seamlessly connect the order for merchandise and the payment for it. PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL ) was and still is only a middleman. Ditto for Apple Pay. Even if other tech companies deploy a 1-click alternative of their own, they're still relying on a third-party to supply and ship goods. Never even mind the fact that Amazon was only granted patent protection for 1-click in the United States. Its requests for patents in other nations were rejected, but that didn't prevent the e-commerce outfit from becoming a force in those markets.

Bottom Line for AMZN Stock

In other words, Amazon stock is still going to be the king of e-commerce, as it has already won the hearts and minds of more consumers than its competition has.

Other players are apt to unveil similar tools in the foreseeable future, but with the exception of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) leveraging product-based searches initiated via the Google search engine, those other companies are still going to struggle to take market share back from Amazon. Even then, Alphabet is years - and miles - behind AMZN stock on the e-tailing front.

With its latest announcement, it's taking a different path than it has in the past, but it's one that could be a winning strategy.

At the start of CES 2017, Amazon and its hardware partners, Seiki, Westinghouse and Element Electronics announced the first set of 4K TV sets that will incorporate elements of the Amazon Fire TV and Amazon Alexa -- the company's artificial intelligence platform.

The TVs will range between 43 and 65 inches, come with a 4K resolution, 3GB of RAM and 16GB internal memory for apps. They'll also come with a remote control that has a built-in microphone that lets the user speak directly into it, and doubles as a direct line to Amazon’s digital assistant, Alexa.

So far, no prices have been announced, but the companies said that the sets would be available on Amazon as well as various retail partners.

The main difference this time around when compared to what Amazon has done in the past is that it's not responsible for the hardware, but just the software.

Before this, Amazon built and owned the hardware, like with the actual Fire TV set-top box, Fire tablets, the Amazon Echo, Kindle e-readers and the forgettable Fire phone, to name a few. Unlike phones or even tablets, the television business is largely a low-margin business with little turnover. People aren't buying TVs every two or three years. And with prices dropping drastically (4K TVs can be bought for well under $1,000 now), there isn't exactly a lot of opportunity to sell premium-priced products at a rapid clip.

With Amazon providing the software, it allows them to get the Fire OS and Alexa into the hands of many more people. Not everyone is a tech whiz and perhaps they can't be bothered connecting a set-top box or a connected speaker to a home entertainment system.

But with Seiki, Westinghouse and Element Electronics building the hardware, and Amazon worrying about the software, it doesn't have to worry about how many units it's sold or how much revenue it makes from the sales. This is essentially a marketing opportunity to show off Amazon's software capabilities and keep people inside the Amazon ecosystem, much like Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Apple (AAPL) want to keep people inside the Android and iOS ecosystems, respectively.

It also helps keep Amazon Prime Video at the forefront of consumer's minds, which may wind up being a bigger revenue driver for the company than some on Wall Street think.

Amazon has worked hard to build up its content on Prime Video, with originals like Man in the High Castle or Goliath, as well as acquiring TV shows and movies from other content companies to beef up its offerings to compete with Hulu, Netflix (NFLX) and others in the space. Amazon's recent announcement that it would be rolling out Prime Video to more than 200 countries is another sign that it's not just a add-on feature for Prime, but a part of a strategy to own everything a consumer does.

By having Fire OS and Amazon Alexa on hardware that doesn't need to be purchased every two or three years, Amazon gets the benefit of being a player in the TV market without the worries. It sounds like a win-win for Amazon and ultimately, its shareholders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR ) reports quarterly numbers again in the beginning of February. Based on past Twitter earnings reports, investors shouldn't expect much to change.

Source: WEnet Studio Via Stock Snap

That could either be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on your perspective.

TWTR stock saw a big drop across the end of 2015 and into January 2016. Then, the social media darling bounced around mostly between $15 and $20 or so for the rest of the year. With shares of Twitter stock under $17 once again, now could be a good buying opportunity. Simply getting back to $20 would be a quick 15% or 20% gain.

However, it's worth noting Twitter has declined almost 10% since Election Day even as the broader stock market has gained about 10% to the upside. That kind of slide needs to quickly be stopped before the social media company finds itself setting new lows and being left in the dust of this rally.

The million-dollar question, then, is should you buy Twitter Inc. stock now? Here are three pros and three cons to explain both sides of the trade:

Pros of Buying Twitter Stock

Buyout Potential: While TWTR stock was stuck mostly between $15 and $20 in 2016, shares did surge to a high of over $25 in October on rumors of a buyout . Potential acquirers included Salesforce.com, Inc. (NYSE: CRM ), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and even Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS ). All it takes is one juicy offer - or even hints of one - and Twitter stock will take off.

Video Potential : If you hadn't heard, last year Twitter embarked on an ambitious partnership with the NFL . The deal allowed the social media company to offer live, streaming video of pro football games. Reports around the first such game in September showed 2 million people checked out the stream, and that bodes very well for future efforts - and future advertising revenue for TWTR stock.

Strong Leadership: Co-founder Jack Dorsey returned to the company as CEO at the end of 2015. Since then, he has made tough decisions to contain costs, including layoffs, as well as engaging directly with Twitter users about what's wrong with the platform. As one of the founding fathers, Dorsey has what it takes to make the hard changes TWTR needs to grow in 2017 and beyond.

Cons of Buying Twitter Stock

No Profits: Of course, one of the biggest challenges both to CEO Jack Dorsey and to any potential acquirers is that Twitter remains unprofitable and has no hope of turning that around anytime soon. Consider that in Q3, revenue grew 8%, but TWTR stock also saw its cost of revenue grow more than 12%. That's not a recipe for success.

No User Growth: Monthly active users have all but flatlined, growing a measly 3% year-over-year in Q3. Worse, the most valuable segment of users in the U.S. is stuck at 67 million users - a measly 1 million more than the 66 million users recorded almost two years ago in Q1 2015. That's also not a recipe for success.

It's Not Facebook: The sad reality is that internet advertisers don't split up their spending evenly among various platforms. They tend to pick one and stick with it - and those platforms are either Google or Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) because both offer sophisticated targeting and massive scale. Twitter simply can't compete with that, and won't be able to land the big advertising deals these other digital advertisers can.

1/4/2017,0.442743422,0.116203328,788.36,791.34,783.16,786.9,1072958,8.18,-1.46,0,"“Crucial near-future technology,” is the phrase respected tech predictor Melanie Swan uses to describe the blockchain phenomenon. Nasdaq recently reached out to Swan (Philosophy and Economic Theory, New School, New York) to explore what that might mean to investors.

On the first day of 2017, the U.S. dollar exchange rate of bitcoin passed the “magic” threshold of $1,000, exciting Bitcoin enthusiasts worldwide. Bitcoin, the value of which more than doubled in 2016, was one of the best investments of the year, and the best-performing currency.

One explanation for the sustained rise of Bitcoin in 2016 could be fear of capital controls in countries like India and China, exacerbated by political uncertainties such as Brexit and the rise of anti-establishment political parties in most of Europe, as well as the election in the U.S. of Donald Trump. But another reason for the rise can be traced to the growing — or, rather, exploding — popularity of blockchain technologies that power Bitcoin and other digital currency platforms such as Ethereum.

“The blockchain,” a generic term for all cryptographic distributed ledgers like Bitcoin and Ethereum, seems poised to revolutionize the banking and financial services sector, which explains why nearly all major banks, and even central banks and national governments, are taking an active role.

But blockchain technologies are also likely to have a strong impact on futuristic, disruptive technologies that are expected to emerge in the next decade, such as supercomputing; artificial intelligence (AI), with applications ranging from self-driving cars to big data analysis for personalized medicine; and advanced medical nanorobotics, tiny devices expected to start policing our bodies and ridding us of pathogens and rogue cancer cells before the end of the 2020s.

All that potential is likely to interest forward-looking investors, from wealthy and institutional players to small investors who want to assemble a public stock portfolio oriented toward long-term growth. But how can investors plan for a blockchain-related future?

Swan has built her reputation as a guiding light through these uncharted waters. She founded the Institute for Blockchain Studies to examine the theoretical, philosophical and societal implications of blockchain technology, and is the author of “Blockchain: Blueprint for a New Economy” (2015), a book dedicated to advanced future applications of distributed ledger technology beyond currency (“Blockchain 1.0”) and smart contracts (“Blockchain 2.0”). Swan’s book, which stands out for its unusually extensive coverage of advanced emerging applications, is a worthwhile read for all technology enthusiasts, analysts and investors.

“Blockchain technology is not necessarily the ‘Newest Latest Thing,’ but it is an idea whose development is quietly underway in the trenches,” Swan told Nasdaq. “While Bitcoin and blockchain technology might not be the final solutions, it is clear that secure value transfer via networks is a crucial near-future technology.”

There is one blockchain technology that stands out, according to Swan.

“Identity [blockchain-based identity management systems] is one killer app now in development for next-generation blockchain technology,” she said. “Having standard mechanisms for confirming digital identity is a necessary infrastructural piece for operations such as affirming asset ownership, implementing electronic medical records, and transferring inventories.”

In fact, identity management is a necessary component of most innovative blockchain-based solutions under development.

“The sectors most likely to be impacted by blockchain technology in the next decade are financial services, supply chain and logistics, energy, healthcare and Internet of Things [IoT],” continued Swan. “Establishing core functionality such as identity confirmation and activity verification — for example, shipment delivery and contents — could see rapid implementation and pave the way for higher-level features such as outright asset transfer.”

The AI technologies that are expected to come out of research labs and play a disruptive role in the real world in only a few years are likely to leverage blockchain technologies for internal operational coordination and interactions with the external world.

“Blockchain technology is a secure automation system for managing and tracking arbitrarily large numbers of items and transactions, which implies that a massive new scale of automated operations could be possible,” explained Swan. “Further, blockchains enact smart networks that enforce good-player behavior via consensus, which suggests that humans and AI [intelligent agents] could interact trustfully on the same networks.”

""More advanced applications include ideas like the Bio-Cryptoeconomy: Nanorobotic DACs [Distributed Autonomous Corporations] for Cell Repair and Enhancement, using blockchains to coordinate the in-body activity of medical nanorobots,” concluded Swan. “Medical nanorobots are tiny robotic machines at the nanoscale roving within the human body to perform a variety of health and enhancement operations.

“While autonomous nanomachines are not imminent, already nanoparticles are being deployed clinically in the human body for dynamically controllable drug delivery and other functions,” Swan said, noting that, in the longer-term future, fleets of medical nanorobots might be brought on board the human body for a variety of pathology resolution and enhancement activities.

“Since blockchain technology is a next-generation internet functionality allowing secure value transfer over networks, companies standing to profit the most from this first could be good investments, such as financial services and technology companies,” Swan advises investors. “A higher risk way to gain exposure would be by investing in blockchain technology companies as they launch initial public offerings in the future, or in private equity funds focusing on the sector.

A number of companies and ongoing projects are following the directives identified above. Microsoft is developing a blockchain-based identity system that allows people, products, apps and services to interoperate across blockchains, cloud providers and organizations. Many companies are developing preliminary blockchain-based applications for the healthcare sector, starting small but with the potential to contribute to next-generation personalized medicine systems.

IBM is integrating blockchain technology with its Watson AI and IoT projects. Mesh networks of smart sensors for industrial applications, developed by blockchain-oriented IoT startups in collaboration with tech titans like IBM, could prepare the way for Google’s bio-molecular nanotechnology projects.

As with any investment, close investigation and risk assessment is always advised and no single investment is right for everyone. The companies and projects mentioned in this article are only a few examples among many driving a changing landscape. But Swan’s glimpse of the future can be helpful as one piece of the informational puzzle for those who want to learn more about the imminent blockchain revolution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(RTTNews.com) - The U.S. Department of Labor has filed a lawsuit to require Google Inc. to provide requested compensation data and documents for the multinational company's Mountain View headquarters as part of a routine compliance evaluation.

The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs asked the technology giant to submit information in September 2015 about its equal opportunity program and to provide supporting documents as part of a scheduled compliance review. As a federal contractor, Google must agree to permit the federal government to inspect and copy records and information relevant to its compliance with the equal employment laws administered by OFCCP.

Filed with the department's Office of Administrative Law Judges, the lawsuit seeks to enforce Google's obligations to provide OFCCP with compensation data, documents and requested information to complete its audit. Federal contractors are scheduled for routine audits through a neutral selection process.

""Like other federal contractors, Google has a legal obligation to provide relevant information requested in the course of a routine compliance evaluation,"" said OFCCP Acting Director Thomas M. Dowd. ""Despite many opportunities to produce this information voluntarily, Google has refused to do so. We filed this lawsuit so we can obtain the information we need to complete our evaluation.""

Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) is one of the greatest success stories in business history. The company has come to dominate the retail industry and is rapidly disrupting many other areas of the global economy.

Yet with its stock up several hundred times in value since its 1997 IPO, you'd be excused for thinking Amazon's days of turbocharged growth are long gone. There are, however, multiple signals that tremendous gains still lie ahead for the e-commerce titan. Here are seven of the most compelling signs that Amazon's best days may still be ahead.

1. The staggering growth of e-commerce

Even after two decades of torrid growth, the rise of e-commerce is still in its early innings. Online sales comprise less than 10% of all U.S. retail sales, and research firm eMarketer estimates that retail e-commerce sales will increase to more than $4 trillion in 2020, up from about $1.5 trillion in 2015. With tens of millions of new people gaining access to the internet every year, e-commerce appears set to keep growing at a rapid pace for at least another decade, and likely much longer. Amazon stands to benefit from this megatrend, perhaps more than any other company.

2. Dominant consumer mindshare

There's a reason Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary Google describes Amazon as its No. 1 competitor : A steadily increasing number of online shoppers start their searches on Amazon.com. In fact, a recent report by marketing firm BloomReach shows that 55% of consumers begin their searches on the retail juggernaut's website when shopping online, up from 44% in 2015. During that time, the percentage of customers who began their product hunts on search engines declined to 28% from 34%. And the share of shoppers whose searches originated at all other retailers' sites combined fell from 21% to only 16%. That's a powerful trend, and a testament to Amazon's large and increasing prominence in the minds of consumers.

3. FBA network effects

One of the main drivers of Amazon's increasing mindshare among online shoppers is its Fulfilled By Amazon program. The FBA program lets third-party merchants use Amazon's online marketplace and distribution infrastructure to sell their goods. This greatly expands the number of product listings available on Amazon.com, thereby offering more value to consumers. And as more people come to Amazon for their online shopping needs, more product creators and merchants flock to Amazon's FBA platform to sell their wares. This virtuous cycle helps to create powerful network effects for Amazon, whereby each additional consumer and merchant that joins the platform creates more value for existing members of the network -- a cycle that should only continue to grow stronger in the years ahead.

4. The rise of Prime

Another powerful driver of Amazon's success is its Prime membership program. Research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimates that the average Prime customer spends $1,200 per year on Amazon, compared to about $600 for non-Prime customers. And while management has yet to disclose the number of Amazon Prime subscribers, CIRP estimates that the number of U.S. Prime members surged 38% year over year to 65 million in the third quarter. With Amazon investing heavily to expand Prime's content and service offerings, it should continue to enjoy rising Prime adoption, which, in turn, should fuel further increases in sales and profit.

5. Struggling competitors

The magnitude of Amazon's dominance may be best reflected in the misfortunes of its rivals. The business graveyard is littered with brick-and-mortar retailers that could not withstand the Amazon-led onslaught of e-commerce. Recent examples include RadioShack and Sports Authority, and many analysts believe venerable Sears Holdings may soon join the ranks of the deceased . Perhaps most telling of all are the recent stock price swoons among even some of the most respected traditional retailers.

AMZN data by YCharts

The message is clear: In a world dominated by Amazon , many other retailers are in a struggle for survival. And as its competitors fade away, Amazon stands to claim the spoils.

6. Growth of AWS

Incredibly, Amazon has another business that may prove to be even more valuable than its core online retail operations. Amazon Web Services has quickly become the dominant provider of scalable cloud computing services, with an estimated 31% share of the global cloud infrastructure market, according to Synergy Research Group. AWS has a massive market opportunity -- so large, in fact, that Amazon's management believes it could eventually rival the company's retail operations in size . The business is already making progress in that regard, with AWS' revenue surging 55% year over year to $3.2 billion in the third quarter. AWS is also highly profitable, with Q3 operating margins of more than 26%. Best of all, AWS has just barely scratched the surface of its potential, and it should continue to turbocharge Amazon's revenue and earnings growth for many years to come.

7. Relentless innovation

Most businesses can only dream of having growth drivers as powerful as AWS and Amazon's online retail operations. Yet even with these potent catalysts well in tow, CEO Jeff Bezos refuses to allow the company he founded to rest on its laurels. Instead, he tenaciously demands that Amazon continue to push the envelope. This focus on innovation has Amazon well positioned to disrupt multiple sectors, such as groceries , home automation , and even package delivery via its drone initiative.

Entrance into these massive industries expands Amazon's total addressable market opportunity by hundreds of billions of dollars. And as Amazon has proven time and again, when it enters a new market, it is not to be taken lightly. As Bezos' juggernaut relentlessly expands its beachheads in these areas in the coming years, Amazon should continue to reward its investors with market-crushing gains.

While competitors in the smartwatch space are either holding off on releasing new models or shutting down altogether, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is all-in on the struggling wearables. The company released the Apple Watch Series 2 last September.

Source: Apple

And according to a new report out of China, signs indicate AAPL could release a new Apple Watch 3 in the fall of 2017, alongside the highly anticipated iPhone 8.

Apple Watch 3 Rumors

Nearly a year and a half separated the release of the original Apple Watch and the follow-up Apple Watch Series 2. If AAPL were to follow that pattern, we wouldn't expect to see the Apple Watch 3 until spring 2018. In fact, there's been speculation that Apple would stretch the window between releases even further.

Smartwatches may not have the same upgrade appeal as smartphones do (they're seen as a more functional accessory), so product releases may end up being more widely spaced out. Tepid consumer reaction to the devices just adds more fuel to that fire.

However, MacRumors is reporting this morning that China's Economic Daily News published a story confirming that once again Quanta Computer (OTCMKTS: QUCPF ) will be manufacturing the new Apple Watch.

The trade paper goes further, though, suggesting the new Apple Watch 3 is expected to be unveiled in the third quarter of 2017 .

Expected Apple Watch 3 Features

With the Apple Watch Series 2, AAPL played it pretty safe. The new smartwatch was virtually identical to the original in appearance. Key upgrades were a faster CPU, a brighter display and built-in GPS.

According to the Economic Daily News , Apple will continue to chip away against the primary consumer complaints about smartwatches. The paper says the new Apple Watch will focus mainly on improving battery life. MacRumors also points out other potential features that have been discussed as possibilities for the next version of Apple's wearable. Top on that list are cellular connectivity (added to the GPS feature gained last fall this would make the Apple Watch 3 fully functional without requiring an iPhone on hand), and the switch to microLED display panels, which would shave some of the thickness and weight from current models.

Grim Smartwatch Market Could Heat up in 2017

2016 wasn't exactly a stellar year for the smartwatch industry. Sales through October were down more than 50% compared to the previous year . Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google division decided to delay releasing the next version of its Android Wear smartwatch operating system until 2017. And of course, the big news was the failure of smartwatch pioneer Pebble , which went out with a whimper; it was acquired by Fitbit Inc (NYSE: FIT ), and all of its products were cancelled.

Lenovo Group Limited (OTCMKTS: LNVGY ) also decided to hit pause on its popular Moto 360 smartwatch, with that company announcing one of the most popular smartwatches in the Android camp would not be getting an update in 2017 .

If all that sounds bad for 2017, it's not exactly great news for the smartwatch industry.

However … that new version of Android Wear could boost interest and likely will lead to a series of third-party smartwatch releases - even if the Moto 360 is absent. Google also has said it will release its own smartwatch hardware in 2017 , hoping to repeat the splash it made with its Pixel Phone in 2016. And it's always possible that Fitbit might cobble something together with its newly acquired Pebble engineers to release a true fitness smartwatch in 2017.

Given the potential for compelling new rival devices, a new Apple Watch 3 for 2017 would make sense for AAPL as a defensive strategy, helping to maintain its lead.

Apple Watch 3 + iPhone 8 = Maximum Apple

The other reason why an Apple Watch 3 in 2017 might be a smart move from AAPL's perspective is the iPhone 8.

This year is expected to be a big one for Apple. The iPhone will be a 10th anniversary release -just in time to fight back against sliding iPhone sales. The iPhone 8 is going to be a huge release for Apple in the fall.

Having an all-new Apple watch 3 to show off beside it would be a big one-two punch, helping to preserve Apple's smartwatch lead while enticing AAPL fans to spend even more money.

As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE: FCAU) has released some information on the Chrysler Portal concept car that it plans to unveil on Tuesday at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas.

The Portal is a futuristic take on a highly connected electric minivan. It's an intriguing idea. But it's also a huge missed opportunity -- and a troubling sign for FCA investors.

A potential Tesla competitor, if it were real

FCA said that the Portal ""explores the possibility of what a family transportation vehicle could look like."" It has some self-driving capabilities, FCA said, and the ability to connect to personal devices and ""the cloud"" in ways that will help to keep the kids entertained on long (or not so long) trips.

FCA said that the Portal has a battery-electric drivetrain with 250 miles of range. Its battery packs are built into the floor, in the style of Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA) . Fast-charging capability will be able to add 150 miles of range in about 20 minutes.

Simply put, the Portal represents an intriguing and advanced potential competitor to Tesla's Model X, one that could turn the market for ""kid-hauler"" vehicles on its head.

Or it would, if FCA planned to build it. But the Portal is strictly a show car -- and that's the problem.

This isn't the electric minivan FCA desperately needs

Here's why it's a problem: The auto industry is changing rapidly, but there are few signs that FCA is taking steps to keep up. This show vehicle doesn't really change that, but an electric vehicle intended for production might have.

Right now, FCA has pickup trucks and Jeep SUVs and Hemi V8s, along with a nice new minivan. (And, to be fair, a brand-new hybrid version of that minivan.) They're popular products and sales have been good. But with no hybrids or electric vehicles to offset them and improve its corporate fuel-economy average, FCA is headed for trouble.

The Portal's dash is a show-car flight of fancy. Image source: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.

FCA does have a deal with Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Waymo self-driving car subsidiary that has produced some self-driving test vehicles and a version of FCA's touchscreen system that integrates the Android operating system. But it's lacking a range of hybrids and a serious electric-car effort as fuel-economy rules tighten -- and that's going to be a big problem in a few years.

The contrast with FCA's old Detroit rivals is instructive. General Motors (NYSE: GM) has a long-range electric car in production and a massive effort under way to develop self-driving technology in-house. Ford (NYSE: F) also has a big self-driving development effort under way, along with a range of well-regarded hybrids and clear, credible plans to add many more electrified vehicles over the next few years. And both have made it clear that they are grappling seriously with the larger technology-driven changes coming to the business of autos.

Chrysler wouldn't have missed this huge opportunity, but FCA did

Not all of the incumbent global automakers will be able to make the leap into the not-too-distant electrified, self-driving, ride-hailing future. Some will be displaced (or ""disrupted"") by new entrants like Tesla and Waymo. It's a good bet that GM and Ford will be important players in that future, because they're taking the steps to get there now. FCA, which is struggling under a huge debt load, hasn't kept up.

A fully electric version of the Chrysler Pacifica would have been a more impressive statement by FCA. Image source: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.

At several points in its long and checkered history, the old Chrysler Corporation was able to dodge corporate death with a brilliant new product at just the right moment. FCA had the opportunity to do that today -- and frankly, when he heard that an electric minivan was in the works, your humble Fool expected a classic Chrysler masterstroke .

Imagine if instead of a futuristic concept, FCA had shown a long-range electric version of its current minivan, the gorgeous Chrysler Pacifica -- and had announced plans to put it into production. Sure, it might take a few years and a huge internal effort to bring that vehicle to market, given that FCA is starting from behind. But it would have the potential to be the first electric vehicle that really connects with the mass market: an electric minivan perfect for tech-savvy young families.

An electric Pacifica would have been a much more powerful statement that FCA sees the future coming and plans to join it in bold style. Instead, it built a vehicle that is just for show, with technology that might or might not actually exist. That also makes a statement, and not a good one.

Paypal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL ) got some good news to start off the New Year.

Source: Shutterstock

Analysts at Monness Crespi Hardt published an upbeat report, indicating: ""We've wanted to turn positive on PayPal for a while."" The firm now has a $50 price target on PayPal stock, which means there is a potential 24% upside.

But this was not the only positive report. Goldman Sachs also put PayPal stock on its conviction list , along with other mega internet companies like Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ).

Why the bullishness? First of all, the holiday season was a clear example that consumers increasingly use their smartphones as wallets. According to research from Adobe Systems Incorporated (NASDAQ: ADBE ), the sales came to a hefty $24 billion (from Nov. 1 to Dec. 20), representing 31% of all online retail sales. This is up from just 19% in 2014. By 2020, Business Intelligence predicts that mobile will come to 45% of the $632 billion total in e-commerce sales.

While mobile commerce is far from easy, this is a big-time opportunity for PayPal. The company has spent years developing intuitive mobile apps for streamlining the purchase process, utilizing features such as Touch ID from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Order Ahead. But PayPal stock has also been customer-focused by allowing various payment types like Visa Inc (NYSE: V ) and Mastercard Inc (NYSE: MA ).

What's more, the company has leveraged its platform to provide comprehensive merchant services. In the latest quarter, the business reported a 34% jump in payments volume to $73 billion . Just some of the marquee customers include Uber, Airbnb and Pinterest .

Of course, a critical part of the strategy - which has certainly helped PayPal stock - is the savvy dealmaking. One example is the acquisition of Xoom, which allows people to easily send payments to 56 countries. It's essentially a new-fangled version of The Western Union Company (NYSE: WU ) and Moneygram International Inc (NASDAQ: MGI ). Keep in mind that the market opportunity is a whopping $600 billion .

But for holders of PayPal stock, the most attractive gem is the wildly popular Venmo app, which has become a must-have for millennials. A key has been capitalizing social features (such as sharing purchases with friends) and integrations, like allowing Apple users to pay with Siri.

In the most recent quarter, Venmo processed $4.9 billion in transaction volume , up a sizzling 131% on a year-over-year basis. The run-rate is near $20 billion.

Bottom Line on PayPal Stock

Currently, there are 192 million active customer accounts, up about 19 million during the past 12 months. And growth is expected to continue. PYPL projects that the top-line will increase at 16% to 17% for the next three years.

Oh, and the company remains a high-margin operator. During Q3 , PYPL posted $801 million in operating cash flows. In all, there is $6.4 billion in the bank.

Despite all this, PayPal stock has still been a bit of a laggard. For the past year, the return is about 12%.

But hey, this means investors have an opportunity to get an affordable play on the mobile revolution. Keep in mind that the forward price-to-earnings ratio is 23, which is reasonable for a growth company. And as noted in the Monness Crespi Hardt report: ""the ability to deliver outsized growth versus peers off this large of a base, while trading at a discount, deserves constructive scrutiny.""

According to reports the project syndicates FCA’s Connect infotainment system with Android 7.0 Nougat. It retains the carmaker’s user interface while mixing a number of apps like Google Assistant and Maps, as well as extra Android apps like Pandora, Spotify, and others.

Meanwhile it’s an extension of a partnership between the two firms that saw Chrysler working with Google to build 100 Pacifica minivans combined with Google’s self-directed driving hardware and software.

The search engine giant firm recently revealed its desire to have Android used in every user-facing system in the car, integrated into anything from climate control and audio controls to the speedometer. That system is open-source and offered for customization to the car maker’s tastes, even comprising support for Android Auto and CarPlay. Many car-makers believe their infotainment user interface is an extension of the car make itself, which makes customizability enormously vital.

“With Android, we are able to maintain our unique and intuitive Uconnect user interface, all while integrating our easy-to-use systems with Android’s features and ecosystem of applications,” said Chris Barman, FCA’s head of electrical engineering, in a statement.

Furthermore if car-maker firms can save time and cash developing infotainment systems on top of Android, particularly with a pre-existing Android app ecosystem, the platform could takeoff. However it faces rivalry both from advanced platforms divisions within carmakers like Audi’s virtual cockpit as well as other podiums like BlackBerry’s QNX.

As most cars infotainment systems are quite hard to use, just about anything that can make them better is a must-have. Both Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU) and Alphabet (GOOG) didn’t announced the exact date when exactly this planned platform will hit the shelves.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) will be happy to put 2016 behind it. Yes, AAPL stock registered double-digit gains and slightly outperformed the market (with one day of trading to go in 2016), but the year was hardly a stellar one.

Source: Apple

Sales are down in key product lines like the iPhone. Its long-awaited MacBook Pro revision faced a barrage of criticism. The iPhone 7 was derided for looking too much like the iPhone 6 and for lacking a headphone port. And to cap it off, AAPL is closing out 2016 facing a series of issues with iPhone 6 batteries .

And while Apple inc. has struggled, opponents have made hay.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) has seized the premium PC mantle with its Surface Studio and Surface Book. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) made an end run around Siri and HomeKit to make the Alexa-powered Echo smart speaker a contender to control the smart home. Alphabet Inc . (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) entered the premium smartphone market with its Android flagship Google Pixel Phone.

AAPL doesn't necessarily need to detonate everything and start all over from scratch, but it could use a turnaround or two in key categories.

Apple Did OK in 2016, But …

Again, short of something crazy happening Friday, Dec. 29, AAPL stock will have returned at least 10% for 2016. That's not bad. In fact, it's downright great compared to last year's 3% losses.

Then again …

In 2014, AAPL returned 47%. In 2012, it was about 25%. Don't forget the heady days of 2009, when the iPhone was gaining in popularity and rumors were flying that the company was about to release a new tablet device (the iPad would be unveiled the following January) - and the market was rebounding out of the cellar. Apple stock gained 115% that year.

AAPL is spending increasingly more on stock repurchases and dividends, so there's less of an expectation of rampant growth … but there's still some sort of expectation for outsize growth. Apple is, after all, a consumer tech company.

And it's not just stock performance. Apple needs to return to form in many aspects, such as re-emerging as an innovator and a designer of world-class premium products.

To accomplish these goals, there are three key objectives that Apple needs to nail in 2017.

#1: The iPhone 8 Needs to Be Hit

There are no two ways about it: The single most important product release in 2017 for AAPL is the iPhone 8.

Sales of iPhones are Apple's single largest source of revenue - 60% of Apple Inc. revenue in the last quarter . If the iPhone 8 is a big hit, it will reverse the slide in sales, and AAPL stock will be off to the races.

To get there, Apple needs to release a product that wows consumers. It must look nothing like the iPhone 6/6s and 7 - and the Android rivals that have adopted a similar form factor. It has to make them forget about headphone jacks and unreliable batteries.

The iPhone 8 needs to have the must-have appeal that makes iPhone owners clamor to upgrade, with line-ups outside Apple Stores once more.

At this point, rumors have AAPL going to an all-glass iPhone 8 with a curved display and wireless charging.

It's a start.

#2: Apple Needs to Win Back the Mac Faithful

The Mac is no longer as important as it once was to Apple, but computers are still the company's third largest line of business. And in 2016, Mac fans felt not just ignored, but slighted.

Some models like the Mac Pro and Mac Mini haven't been upgraded in years. And when Apple did release a new MacBook Pro, it seemed to have gone out of its way to anger many of its core customers by eliminating all legacy ports in favor of USB-C. The new TouchBar feature generally received a shrug from professional users, while higher cost and poor battery life continue to generate complaints.

Rubbing salt in the wound(s), in 2016, AAPL also discontinued the computer monitor and Airport wireless router lineups that have been popular with Mac owners for decades.

In 2017, Apple Inc. must do more than offer a discount on USB-C dongles. The company needs to update its Mac desktops - the Mac Pro, Mac Mini and iMac - with new processors. It can (and should) add USB-C ports to its computers, but it needs to leave a legacy port or two instead of arbitrarily eliminating them all and forcing customers to buy new peripherals or clumsy adapters.

A 2017 MacBook Pro revision with a price cut, improved battery - and maybe even a retreat to adding one old-fashioned USB 3.0 port (although that move may be technically impossible at this point) would also go a long way.

#3: Apple Needs to Refocus on the Home

Apple was a home tech pioneer with the 2007 Apple TV, but despite a wealth of tools at its disposal - including that Apple TV business combined with iTunes video streaming, HomeKit, Siri and its Beats Electronics audio gear - the company sputtered in the home in 2016.

In 2017, Apple Inc. needs to get on the 4K video streaming bandwagon with iTunes and the Apple TV or it's going to seem hopelessly out of sync with what consumers expect, especially when it charges a premium for its non-4K gear.

AAPL also needs to get Siri into a Beats speaker before the Amazon Echo, and competitors from Google and Microsoft lock up the smart home.

Of course a company like Apple has other balls in the air as well. In 2017, a thinner Apple Watch with improved battery life, a refinement of the iPad Pro line-up or new Apple Music features are possible. But these product lines all received big upgrades in 2016. Autonomous car plans are still underway and could pay off big, but not next year.

Bottom Line for AAPL Stock

If 2017 is to be a year where consumers are excited about the company and its products, and Apple stock has another one of those historical runs, the company needs to nail the iPhone 8, win back Mac fans and re-assert its presence in the connected home.

The post 3 Things Apple Inc. (AAPL) MUST Do to Soar in 2017 appeared first on InvestorPlace .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12/30/2016,0.523119711,0.181636344,782.75,782.78,770.41,771.82,1769950,12.37,-10.93,0,"Google's new Home smart speaker. Image source: Google.

Chatbots won't just live in your favorite messaging app. Soon, you may be speaking with them through a smart speaker.

In December, Google launched a system for developers to build chatbots that work with Google Assistant -- the artificial intelligence (AI) that powers its Google Home smart speaker. Google's goal is to get people used to interacting with businesses through Google Assistant with simple-to-answer questions. Down the line, the Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) company is hoping users will start purchasing goods and booking reservations with the new chatbots.

If any of that sounds familiar, it's because it's the exact approach Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) is taking with its chatbots for Messenger. When it comes to monetizing its messaging app, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has stressed the importance of developing organic interactions between users and businesses on the platform before trying to monetize.

Ultimately, Facebook and Google are working on similar solutions to solve the same problem of monetizing some of their fastest-growing sources of engagement.

An engaging problem

Google and Facebook are seeing considerable increases in voice search and messaging, respectively. Google said voice searches have tripled over the past two years. Meanwhile, the number of Facebook Messenger users has climbed from just 200 million in April of 2014 to over 1 billion today. Facebook also says the average user spends 10 more minutes per day between Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger than it did in 2014, a 25% increase.

Both Google and Facebook are unable to take advantage of these growing sources of engagement the same way they've done with their other platforms. Display advertisements don't work nearly as well in a messaging app as compared to the Facebook News Feed. In the case of voice search, there may not even be a place to display ads at all. It'd be a bit off-putting if your Google Home suddenly lit up with a big ""click here"" banner (not that there's even a display).

The chatbot solution

The chatbot solution works for both platforms, as they're conversational in nature. Still, there are a couple of major hurdles for both Google and Facebook to overcome. First, they both need to attract a lot of developers. Facebook has already attracted 34,000 developers and has over 30,000 bots running on its platform. That's a strong start for a product that launched less than a year ago.

More importantly, however, is that users need to interact with chatbots. They need to be able to easily discover them, and there needs to be a compelling reason for them to use chatbots over another medium. Discovering chatbots on Messenger is relatively easy. Facebook is able to show popular bots when users search for someone to chat with. Finding new bots through the screenless Google Home is yet another challenge for Google to overcome.

Cutting out the middleman

There's not much Google or Facebook can do to get around their reliance on third parties to build bots for their platforms. Unfortunately for them, one competitor doesn't have to rely on third parties if it wants to sell goods and services. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) can sell things directly to consumers through its Echo smart speakers.

Amazon also has a head start on both since it launched the first version of the Echo speaker in 2014. The company sold over 5 million units since the launch, according to a report from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. And sales are growing fast. Amazon reported a ninefold increase in holiday sales of Alexa-powered devices this holiday season.

Amazon isn't just selling physical goods, either. It's recently started moving into services like house cleaning and car repairs. While Amazon doesn't sell everything directly, it already has a popular platform for buying and booking just about anything you could imagine. As Amazon continues to build out the functionality of Alexa on its Echo speakers, there'll be no need to seek out specific bots (even though Amazon supports its own version of chatbots as well).

That existing base of commerce makes Amazon the biggest threat to Facebook and Google's monetization efforts for their growing platforms. With investors expecting both Facebook's messaging apps and Google's voice searches to start throwing off significant revenue in the future, Amazon may play spoiler for both.

I started having exposure to investing in my first year of business school. Like many, I never pictured entering the investing environment. In fact, I did three years as a nursing student before making the switch to economics. From there, I started reading as much as I could, from every style of investing to studying the greats such as Buffett, Graham, Klarman, Cundill, Greenblatt, Pabrai, Lynch and many more. Oddly, my investment style started off with technical analysis, trading mainly options before progressing to deep value.

How I got into investing: In my high school years, I always wanted to contribute to society, so I pursued nursing. During my years as a nursing student, I would always ask myself if I was able to progressively excel, and if my passion would continue to grow in this career for the next 5, 10, 15 years, and until the end of my days. The honest answer was no, but it took me three years to accept that. In my current environment, business- particularly investing, I can confidently say I found my passion; I am where I belong.

Moral of my story - be honest and act accordingly, it will save you some valuable time.

2. Describe your investing strategy and portfolio organization. What valuation methods do you use? Where do you get your investing ideas from?

If I had to categorize my current and foreseeable investing strategy / style, it would be deep value. I like stocks that are mispriced and selling at a significant discount in relation to their intrinsic value; net-nets and cigar-butts. Essentially, I look for stocks where if I bought them today, and it were to liquidate tomorrow, paying all debts and returning all capital to shareholders, I would walk away with a significant profit. Generally (not a golden rule), I would do a valuation based on asset reproduction, earnings potential value then growth value, in that particular order. Valuation methods depend upon the nature of the business and the company, so it could vary significantly, but in the end- I require a margin of safety. I have a particular focus on current and liquid assets. I also prefer debt-free (or very little debt) and well-managed companies, but these are rare when it comes to deep-value stocks. I try not to get involved in industries I am unfamiliar with, such as biotech and complex firms. I much prefer simple businesses (particularly service, holdings and asset-based companies).

In terms of portfolio organization, deep-value stocks are usually small-caps and I try not to go over 10 stocks (deep value or not).

I get my ideas from numerous places. It can range from a friend, articles posted online or certain investing sites, and sometimes certain screeners. Often, I like to look at SEC filings, Joel Greenblatt ( Trades , Portfolio )'s Magic Formula and the 52- week lows.

3. What drew you to that specific strategy? If you only had three valuation metrics, what would they be?

The themes that drove me to this specific strategy are margin of safety and protection against permanent loss of capital. Those are my core concerns in any stock. Compound interest paired with good deep-value stocks, along with some time, will take care of the performance side. Of course, one should always be wary of value traps and miscalculations. Another reason that I like this strategy is that most of these stocks are under the radar- not popular nor researched as much in comparison to hot stocks, therefore I do not have to try to outsmart the next analyst or any of that sort.

I do not put much emphasis on a single valuation metric, or even a few. Because valuations are subjective and financial models and forecasts are more of an opinion rather than a prediction or a prophecy, valuation is more of an art than an exact science. Therefore, every investment case has its own unique merit. In playing piano, you cannot play a masterpiece with a single note, you need the keys to flow together in order to project your art. Similarly, it is difficult to tell the story of a company with just a few valuation metrics, they all have to be included and analyzed together for a more ""logical"" valuation.

But, if gun to my head, and hesitantly, I had to choose only three valuation metrics, I would look for a good NCAV (Net Current Assets - Total Liabilities to be significantly positive), low price-earnings (as these stocks tend to perform well over the long run), EV/ EBITDA and, to add another one, price-book. In isolation, each metric has their own merit but also a significant blindspot.

4. What books or other investors changed the way you think, inspired you or mentored you? What is the most important lesson learned from them? What investors do you follow today?

I spend a lot of time reading, particularly business and investment books. Every single book has, in one extent or another, influenced me. I try to absorb the most useful concepts from these books and borrow ideas from various greats and mix them in a box with a little bias towards deep-value investing.

You can check out my full booklist here.

My very first investment book was ""The Neatest Little Guide to Stock Market Investing"" by Jason Kelly, which shed the very first investing light upon me. ""The Intelligent Investor"" by Benjamin Graham definetly made the biggest impression on me. ""Security Analysis"" by Graham and Dodd, ""A Random Walk Down Wall Street"" by Burton G. Malkiel, ""The Most Important Thing Illuminated"" by Howard Marks (Trades, Portfolio) and ""Margin of Safety"" by Seth Klarman (Trades, Portfolio) have all helped reinforce the concept of margin of safety and protection against permanent loss of capital.

Other great investors that have inspired me and that are worth researching are Joel Greenblatt (Trades, Portfolio), Peter Cundill, George Soros (Trades, Portfolio), Philip A. Fisher, Peter Lynch and Mohnish Pabrai (the list goes on).

If I had to single out an important lesson, it is that much of the investing knowledge can be learned for most individuals, the difficult part is controlling your emotions. As, Graham, the father of value investing himself, puts it:

""The fault dear investors is not in our stars- and not in our stocks- but in ourselves"".

Today, I follow top value investors, particularly Buffett, Klarman and Greenblatt.

5. How long will you hold a stock and why? How long does it take to know if you are right or wrong on a stock?

I invest for the long run, but I would not put a specific time horizon on holdings (especially with deep-value stocks). I would say that deep-value stocks and undervalued stocks in general tend to eventually converge towards their ""intrinsic value"" after some time, so I hold them until then and re-evaluate, or until the margin of safety has been erased.

Additionally, if there is a threat for permanent capital loss, or if I was just wrong in my decision making, I will sell the stock. I change when the facts and fundamentals change. Typically, I would want to hold a stock forever, assuming it retains and can grow its intrinsic value in relationship to price. The dilemma some investors face is that often times, it may take a while for the market to correctly price an undervalued stock; this is why margin of safety is so important.

6. How has your investing approach changed over the years?

My investment approach has evolved dramatically since I began my investing journey. I started more as a technical investor, holding active options. Early on, I had a strong reliance on technical metrics such as RSI, moving averages, volume and other technical indicators. Through personal growth, reading and acquiring greater knowledge, I transitioned to value and deep-value investing. Initially, I would use broader metrics and rely on quality companies with fair prices. Now, I lean towards deeply discounted stocks with relatively small downside and larger upside potential. I would say that my approach now is geared towards deep value, or an NCAV approach, which naturally drifts toward smaller caps- preferably service firms, some cyclical and asset-based companies (land, real estate). As a Canadian investor, these are quite difficult to find within the TSX, so I often have to look in the American exchanges. I have yet to fully explore other foreign markets. Every now and then, I tend to search for bigger, good-quality companies hoping to find a bargain, and I now hold a greater amount of cash.

Of course, my investing strategy is continuously evolving- as is everyone's, and I have no bias against good-quality, well-established and moated companies selling at discounts, I just research more deep value.

7. Name some of the things that you do or believe that other investors do not.

This is a great question! Things I do particularly would be that I usually think of the worst-case scenario during the analysis of a stock, and how I would objectively take actions post-purchase, additionally, what lessons I would learn if I were wrong. When purchasing a security, there are always two parties, a buyer and a seller. I always tell myself that everyone else is just as smart, if not smarter, than I am, so when I do make a decision- I am extra careful and remind myself that I can very well be wrong- which emphasizes my reliance on margin of safety. Furthermore, when I work on my valuation models, I try not to emphasize its importance because estimating certain aspects, such as rate of growth and earnings, with laser precision is nearly impossible (at least for me).

Ultimately, I feel that a big portion of investing is about yourself and your own honesty- of course, all this is purely my own opinion. I try not to be the next Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) (as much as it would be nice), but rather I strive to be the best version of myself.

8. What are some of your favorite companies, brands or even CEOs? What do you think are some of the most well-run companies? How do you judge the quality of the management?

My favorite companies are what I define as quality companies; those that have a long-term horizon, are efficient, heavily moated, adaptable, increase shareholder value over time and, more importantly, honest. Some of these companies include Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B), Coca-Cola ( KO ), Wal-Mart ( WMT ), Google ( GOOG )( GOOGL ), Apple ( AAPL ) and the list goes on.

To no surprise, my favorite CEO is Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio). Others to be named are from the book ""The Outsiders,"" which are Bill Anders, John Malone, Tom Murphy and the list goes on.

It is hard to define ""well run,"" every company is different; some in different stages and industries. For instance, Delta Air Lines (DAL) has great operations- it is ""well run"" in relation to the nature of the industry- but the industry itself is very capital-intensive and hard to have a significant advantage over competition. Of course, quality companies are not always a good buy if they are overvalued- nor does it mean I will hold them. We must always think value in relation to price.

To me, quality management is based upon optimal decision-making and integrity. Judging the exact economic value added from a good management team is hard to gauge. Long-term past performance record in relation to economic events (booms, busts) should be an adequate indicator (I want to know how they performed in good and bad times). Other qualitative factors can be found in reading annual reports and filings. Overall, I do not emphasize management as much as the nature of the business operations- this is not to say management is unimportant.

9. Do you use any stock screeners? What are some efficient methods to find undervalued businesses apart from screeners?

I do use screeners, some from Morningstar and Bloomberg - no heavy emphasis. I think there are plenty of ways to find undervalued businesses by researching 52-week lows, researching cyclical sectors and reading investment ideas (other individuals have great ideas- but do your own research, too). By nature, small-caps and over-the-counter stocks will have the most undervalued businesses. Searching in smaller caps is a good start.

10. Name some of the traits that a company must have for you to invest in, such as dividends. Talk about what the ideal company to invest in would look like, even if it does not exist.

A company must absolutely be undervalued before I can consider it. Depending on the nature of the business, I would value it based on its asset valuations, then earnings power, then growth potential.

The ideal company would be one that is selling at a deep discount to its intrinsic value, say price-net net working capital of about 50%, it has a positive NI, does buybacks (historically), insiders and top-tier management historically have ownership and has a few upcoming catalysts. Additionally, it helps if the company has a simple business model that I can understand and relatively easier assets to value (land, buildings, holdings).

11. What kind of checklist or homework do you utilize when investing? Do you have a specific approach, structure, process that you use? Or do you have any hard cut rules?

I do not use a specific checklist, but companies that have the components mentioned earlier are considered. I do my very best to build models and valuations from scratch for anything that catches my interest. Structure wise, I always read the balance sheet first, then the income statement, then cash flow. These can easily be found through SEC filings. I usually read the most updated (recent quarter), then the previous fiscal years. No hard cut rules.

12. Before making an investment, what kind of research do you do and where do you go for the information? Do you talk to management?

As previously mentioned, I seek out information from the balance sheet, income statement and cash flow from various sources like MorningStar and Bloomberg, but I mainly use SEC filings. After my own valuation, I usually make a decision on whether or not to invest in the company. I do not talk to management.

13. How do you go about valuing a stock and how do you decide how you are going to value a specific stock? When is cheap not cheap? If you can, give some of examples.

I mentioned valuation earlier. Cheap is not cheap if the company is burning through its cash and has no foreseeable measures to counter that. In this case, the margin of safety on a stock will quickly deteriorate. Another case is if it has no way to operate profitably in the future. Unforeseen liabilities and loss of sales (a big account) will render a company not cheap in the future (in relation to a current valuation).

14. What kind of bargains are you finding in this market? Do you have any favorite sectors or avoid certain areas, and why?

There are always bargains available with enough research. I am looking mostly within the U.S. exchanges and the TSX, so my scope for deep-value stocks is more limited. Sector wise, I like service firms (they can expand and contract alongside the economy), smaller financials, real estate and some cyclicals. There are deep values in biotechnologies, but I tend to avoid them as I do not have a deep understanding of this sector. I avoid areas that make me scratch my head.

15. How do you feel about the market today? Do you see it as overvalued? What concerns you the most?

I have no particular feeling about the overall market. It is what it is. I have a high focus on U.S. stock markets and the Canadian market. I think their large-caps are priced accordingly, perhaps with a slight premium, and some stock valuations are absurd, but generally it is not overvalued nor cheap- purely my opinion. The interest rate hike might affect valuations and reverting back to the mean might take place, but that is not something I am overly concerned about. What will happen with the economy next? I do not know and neither does the next person. What will happen to the stock market this upcoming year? As J.P. Morgan puts it, ""It will fluctuate.""

16. What are some books that you are reading now? What is the most important lesson learned from your favorite one?

I am currently reading "" HBR's 10 Must Read on Strategy"" by Harvard Business Review and ""Zero to One"" by Peter Thiel. I write about business lessons and concepts from books on my site.

If you have any recommendations, please do contact me. I love sharing ideas and learning new concepts.

17. Any advice to a new value investor? What should they know and what habits should they develop before they start?

I would say to keep an open mind, be creative and be yourself. Do not buy something you do not know. Every investing style has their own unique merit. Equally, if not more important, read and learn as much as you can. Practice, apply the knowledge by actually analyzing the company yourself, build your own models and valuations, strive for continuous growth and remember that nothing of value comes easy. We are human; we make mistakes. There is always someone better than you - so be honest and humble. Make time your friend, not your enemy.

18. What are your some of your favorite value investing resources or tools? Are there any investors that you piggyback or coattail?

Resource wise, there are plenty of articles written over the internet; here on GuruFocus, Seeking Alpha, WSJ and countless others. I use Excel as my main valuation tool. I try to keep things simple, complex models do not necessarily yield a more accurate forecast or valuation. Borrowing ideas are fine, but you must absolutely do your own research.

19. How do you manage the mental aspect of investing when it comes to the ups, downs, crashes, corrections and fluctuations?

It did take a bit for me to develop a better mental aspect in investing; when I started off with more volatile and risky investments, it would keep me up. But, learning and striving for growth paired with time has done its magic. Ups, downs, crashes, corrections and fluctuations are what make the stock markets. We can profit from them in many ways. Now, I am not particularly affected by how the market fluctuates. If I am right, time will tell; if I am wrong, again time will tell (but hopefully I recognize it early). I have no particular emotion towards the markets - it is what it is. I think being honest can help manage the mental aspect. For instance, if you feel like selling the stock because it took a drop, ask yourself what factual rationale is compelling you to make that decision- and if its fear (be honest), well you will know what you need to work on.

20. How does one avoid blowups in value investing?

Extensive due diligence and a sound rationale may diminish blowups. Minimizing leverage and avoiding it altogether would definetly help too. Prioritizing capital protection over seeking profits would be a logical solution. Concentration in poor companies can be a reason for blowing up (this is not to say you must absolutely diversify).

Despite hitting an all-time high at $839 just over two months ago, GOOGL is currently lagging the broader market, up just 2% on a year-to-date basis. In fact, the shares this week lost hold of the round $800 mark, and they may struggle to get it back. Peak open interest currently resides at the January 2017 800-strike call, suggesting the level could emerge as resistance as front-month expiration approaches.



Today the shares are off 1% at $795.17, and more losses could be ahead. GOOGL has ended only three of the last 10 first-quarter periods in positive territory, with an average return of negative 2% for the quarter over the past decade.

Even after the equity's recent slump, however, optimism toward the Google parent runs high. Out of 29 analysts following the stock, all but two recommend buying the shares, and just one recommends selling. Plus, the average 12-month price target is seated deep in never-before-seen territory, at $967. Short interest on GOOGL is also low. After rising nearly 10% in the most recent reporting period, these bearish bets still account for a meager 0.5% of the security's total float.

If there is pessimism toward the blue-chip stock, it resides in the options pits. The stock's 10-day put/call volume ratio across the International Securities Exchange (ISE), Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX) is seated just 2 percentage points from an annual high, at 0.89. Perhaps these recent put buyers are on to something, since it's an unusually attractive time to pick up Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) short-term options.

MSFT still has a lead over the broad market, up 12% 2016, after hitting a record high above $64 last week. But the stock has been positive in the first quarter just three times in the last decade, with an average return of negative 1.7% for the period. The shares are down 1% today, at $62.24.

Analysts are mostly bullish toward MSFT, with 20 out of 26 calling the stock a ""buy"" or better. Short interest is also low, representing just 0.7% of the equity's available float. Even options traders have maintained upbeat positions toward the Dow component -- MSFT's 50-day call/put volume ratio at the ISE, CBOE, and PHLX is seated in the high 86th percentile of its annual range, at 2.37.



And like GOOGL, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is presenting a compelling opportunity for options buyers. Based on the stock's Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) of 16% -- lower than 89% of all readings from the last 12 months -- MSFT's near-term options should be particularly well-priced, from a volatility perspective.

Now operating as part of the company Access in Alphabet's ""other bets"" division, the fiber service has recently seen its CEO depart without being replaced, halted expansion in new cities, and laid off almost 10% of its staff.

On Thursday, that convergence of factors prompted speculation by the tech news web site The Information that Google is likely getting ready to dispose of the service , which was a pioneer in bringing gigabit Internet download speeds to consumers. Telecom operator CenturyLink —which is in the process of buying Level 3 Communications ( lvlt ) for $34 billion —is a ""possible acquirer,"" the web site said without citing a source.

Get Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter.

Fortune reached out to Google ( googl ) for comment and will update this story if any response is received. CenturyLink ( ctl ) declined to comment.

Just two months ago, Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat had defended the project publicly , telling analysts on a quarterly earnings call that the fiber service was ""making great progress"" and remained ""committed to growth"" in its already active markets.

The likelihood of the speculated sale would depend heavily on the fiber business's financials as there is no obvious reason the unit would be appealing to any buyer. Stringing fiber optic high speed Internet connections to homes around the country is exceedingly expensive—as Google has discovered—and requires competing with deeply entrenched monopoly cable and telephone operators. The service has not reached critical mass in any of the eight scattered markets from Austin to Nashville to Salt Lake City that it has entered in the past six years.

CEO Craig Barratt left in October and has not been replaced. At that time, the unit also reportedly laid off about 130 out of 1,500 workers. A few months prior, the service had announced it was revamping its business model to use more wireless technology as it paused all planned expansions into brand new cities.

Google is hardly the first company to run into cost issues while trying to provide consumer Internet and cable TV service, even before the era of high-speed fiber optic connections. Dozens of upstart carriers went bankrupt in the 1990s and early 2000s trying to break into the telecommunications and cable markets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lots of metrics are factored in when I’m considering what makes a ‘good’ smartphone, or, indeed the ‘best’. Battery life, performance, camera, build quality, innovation, sound quality and overall design, amongst others. The more boxes the phone ticks, the higher it scores.

But one factor trumps all others: how much of an all-rounder it is. That means how many of the features it has are ‘above-average’ or ‘good’. The last phone I considered to be a true all-rounder was the iPhone 6 Plus. Now it’s the Google Pixel XL.

Google’s first (official) effort is an impressive one. Most smartphone manufacturers have one standout feature and fail elsewhere. For example, HTC has excellent sound output but performance is often a mixed bag. Or, say, LG which has some clever, innovative ideas that come at the expense of build quality and battery life.

With the Google Pixel XL it nails almost every area. The camera is still the best I’ve ever used in a smartphone. The app is lacking some manual controls, but the fact that auto mode produces near perfect results means limited manual control doesn’t really matter. The battery life is also the best I’ve tested this year. I went to bed the other day with 60% battery left after 12 hours of medium usage.

Performance remains lightning fast, which is particularly apparent when I’m escaping into VR worlds with Day Dream. And the overall build quality is solid. It feels rugged despite being light, slim and crammed full of functionality.

Nexus devices being 'bland' isn't really an accurate trope any more. Stock Android is an impressive standalone OS that doesn't need touching up by third party manufacturers or roms to make it interesting. Nowhere else is that more apparent than the Pixel XL. The integration of Assistant, fast updates and security patches and minimalist UI gives the Pixel XL the cleanest - and most efficient - Android experience on the market.

Nokia Corp (ADR) (NYSE: NOK ) stock has gained a little over 10% in the last two months after experiencing a bit of a rally. However, looking at the picture for the entire year, Nokia stock is still off 31% year-to-date. The fact is that despite the recent comeback, NOK stock still faces several tough fundamental challenges.

Consider that NOK's outlook for next year calls for a 2% decline in the networking business. It's important to note that telecom carriers have been holding off on purchases because they have already spent substantial amounts on upgrading their networks to 4G technologies.

There is also weakness in emerging markets. In fact, with the surge of the dollar, the problems may get even worse. All of this is kind of grim, right? But when it comes to investing, a contrarian approach can certainly lead to nice profits.

So does Nokia stock fit the bill? Perhaps the company is poised for a turnaround? Well, let's take a look.

Three Pros to Owning Nokia Stock

Innovation : Nokia Technologies is the segment that focuses on consumer and professional technology offerings, such as those for digital health and media. Although, for the most part, much of the growth has been from licensing its extensive patent portfolio.

But NOK is certainly investing aggressively with its own innovations. For example, the company has developed a sophisticated virtual reality system for professionals. One of the marquee clients is Sony Corp (ADR) (NYSE: SNE ), which has had lots of success with its PlayStation VR platform.

In addition to this, Nokia is making another play for the smartphone market. The device is called the Nokia P , which is based on Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Android operating system and will be manufactured by Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Ltd. (OTCMKTS: HNHPF ). Granted, the smartphone market is brutally competitive. But it is encouraging that NOK is taking some risks. Besides, the company has a lot of experience marketing technologies in developing countries.

Nokia stock has also been getting more adventuresome with mergers and acquisitions. Just look at the deal for Withings. The company is a pioneer in the connected health market, such as with digital weighting scales, activity trackers and baby monitors. According to NOK's own research, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 37% from 2015 to 2020 .

Network : NOK has a high-performance, end-to-end platform, covering mobile networks, fixed networks, IP/optical networks, applications and analytics. Because of this, the company has been able to sell to a wide assortment of customers, such as in verticals like energy, the public sector and transportation. What's more, the recent acquisition of Gainspeed has been important in attracting cable operator customers too.

But the real play is for 5G mobile networks. According to a report from Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (NASDAQ: ERIC ), the market is expected to hit 550 million users by 2022. A key driver will be the megatrend of the Internet of Things, which involves wireless connections among devices, as well as video and VR.

According to InvestorPlace.com's Dana Blankenhorn : ""If you get into Nokia now, you're catching the next wave of network spending at its bottom, and can ride that wave to profit. That is the bull case, and while that might take some time to prove out, it's a good bet carriers will spend again in the next three to five years.""

Dividend and Fiscal Disciplne : With the transformative acquisition of Alcaltel Lucent, NOK is expected to generate savings of €1.2 billion per year. And these may ultimately prove to be fairly conservative. If anything, NOK has shown a great ability to be disciplined with its cost structure.

In other words, margins are likely to expand over time, especially as the network business starts to recover.

In the meantime, investors will likely enjoy a competitive dividend, which is at nearly 6%.

Three Cons to Owning Nokia Stock

History and Brand : NOK has a storied history. Back in the late 1980s, the company realized the potential of the mobile industry and started to develop its own devices. Nokia was also critical in establishing the core standards for wireless systems. So by the end of the 1990s, the company was one of the most valuable tech operators in the world.

But unfortunately, NOK failed to keep up the innovation, which allowed Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and GOOGL to dominate the market. By 2012, Nokia stock sunk below $2 a share and it looked like survival was in doubt.

So yes, it is remarkable that the company has been able to get some stability and invest in growth. But then again, when it comes to turnarounds in the tech industry, the success rate is usually not so good. It is incredibly tough to catch up - and there is always the tarnishing of the brand. After all, how many people want to buy a product from a company that seems like a has-been?

Competition : Even with the consolidation, the networking business remains highly competitive. Granted, some of the rivals are not particularly strong, such as Ericsson. But these kinds of companies can still be very problematic since they are often tempted to engage in price wars.

Although, for NOK stock the biggest threat could be from the operators in China, like Huawei and ZTE. They not only have the benefit of low-cost platforms but also preferential access to their home markets.

Moreover, growth has been strong. For the first half of this year, the revenues of Huawei spiked by 40% to $36.8 billion . Then again, the company has a diversified revenue base, which not only includes the sales of networking equipment but also smartphones (ranked No. 3 in the world).

Currently, NOK has the second highest market share for wireless infrastructure equipment, at about 26%. This compares to Huawei's 23%. However, given the company's growth ramp, it probably won't be long until it becomes the world leader.

Patents : Licensing of intellectual property has been the only growth driver for Nokia stock. In the latest quarter , this business helped ignite a 109% increase in sales for the Nokia Technologies division. The run-rate for the year is expected to hit €950 million.

But there is a big issue: About €150 million of existing licensing revenues will expire this year. This is one of the reasons NOK has been ramping up its legal efforts .

Yet this type of litigation can be time consuming and unpredictable. And even if there is a win, it can still take years of appeals to get any resolution. More importantly, AAPL is known to be a tough fighter when it comes to IP claims.

Bottom Line On Nokia Stock

While the long-term prospects of 5G look promising, it will take time for the market to get going. Customers will certainly try to find ways to delay the heavy investments and try to find ways to keep leveraging the existing networks. There are also the intense competitive forces that will weigh on margins.

In the meantime, NOK stock must deal with other problems, such as the expiration of a bulk of the licensing business. If the company is unable to manage this, the revenue impact will definitely be significant.

So given all this, the cons outweigh the pros - even though Nokia stock does sport a compelling dividend yield.

Recently, Baidu teamed up with KFC to open a new ""Smart Restaurant"" in Beijing which uses facial recognition technology to make order recommendations. Image recognition hardware installed at the restaurant can scan the consumer's face and make recommendations based on the customer's profile (age, gender) or previous order history. This new feature will be launched at just one restaurant as the company experiments with AI in this business. However, this is an indication that AI is likely to be a key growth driver for Baidu in the next few years. The company is experimenting with this technology in several business lines, including autonomous cars among others. We believe Baidu's growth in the long term can be driven by innovative use of this technology.

Increased Focus On Artificial Intelligence In New Lines Of Business

Baidu's experiment with KFC is an indication that the company is ready to innovate with its expertise in the artificial intelligence space. According to Baidu, its voice and image recognition technology are fairly mature and the company is working on developing natural language processing and user profiling. With a strong focus on this technology Baidu is looking at innovative ways to monetize this capability. While its ""Search Services"" segment is the company's key revenue driver, AI can not only support growth in this business but also create new revenue streams. In addition to increasing user engagement and efficiency in its existing search business, leveraging AI for new lines of business can drive growth for Baidu in the long term. While the ""Smart Restaurants"" idea holds some potential, it is more noteworthy as an indication of how AI can be used in a variety of consumer-facing businesses.

12/29/2016,0.387483912,0.103370335,783.33,785.93,778.92,782.79,744272,7.01,-0.54,0,"Sina ( SINA ) has reported strong growth in ad revenues this year due to the increasing popularity of its websites and apps such as the Sina mobile app and social media platform Weibo. The company generates a significant portion of its revenues from online brand advertising and marketing on its websites and social media platforms. In addition to advertising revenues, the company makes money from mobile value added services (MVAS) and other fee-based services for data licensing, corporate accounts and other gaming related services.

Over the years Sina's advertising business has thrived , with revenues growing at a CAGR of over 20% in the last five years. The trend has continued in 2016 thus far, with ad revenues through the first three quarters of the year (particularly on Weibo) driving much of the top line growth. Below we take a look at how Sina has performed this year.

Weibo Drives Ad Revenues

Sina's advertising revenues were up by 16% y-o-y to $602 million through the first three quarters of the year, as shown below. Comparatively, non-advertising revenues - which include MVAS revenues, Weibo value-added services and other services revenues - increased by around 11% to $116 million. A key point to note here is that within the advertising segment, Weibo has been instrumental in driving growth for the company while portal advertising revenues on Sina's platforms have struggled this year. Weibo-ad revenues were up by 40% y-o-y to $383 million while portal advertising revenues (generated from online brand advertising on Sina.com and Sina mobile properties) from January through September this year fell by around 10% year-over-year to $219 million.

Weibo's social media platform had many similarities to Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ), Facebook ( FB ), Instagram and video-sharing capabilities similar to YouTube to engage more users on its platform. Weibo has over 600 million registered users with almost 400 million monthly active users (MAUs) by the end of Q3 this year. As a result, Weibo has become a popular advertising space among digital brand advertisers in China. Ad revenues from Weibo's advertising segment have been boosted by a robust contribution from small and medium enterprise (SME) customers. Sina launched self-service ads in late 2014 to further help SME accounts post more relevant ads. As a result, ad revenues from SME customers have contributed significantly to growth in ad revenues . This is likely to continue to drive ad revenue growth in the long run.

Furthermore, advertising segment has a higher gross margin than the company-wide gross margin. Sina's advertising segment gross margin stood at just under 65% this year, which was almost 4 percentage points higher than the year-ago period. Comparatively, the non-advertising segments have gross margins of less than 60%.

Margins, Profits Surge This Year



Driven by strong growth in ad revenues and advertising segment gross margins, Sina's company-wide gross margin improved by 350 basis points to 64.2% through the first three quarters of the year. In addition to strong growth from major revenue streams, Sina was successful in restricting growth in the net operating expenses as shown below. Sina's non-GAAP operating expenses through the three quarters of the year were roughly flat over the comparable prior year period at $359 million, which led operating income (non-GAAP) to grow almost five-fold to $97 million. Resulting year-to-date net income and earnings per share were also significantly higher than the prior year period. as shown below.

We expect future revenue growth and improvement in gross margins for Sina's advertising segment to continue in the coming years, driven primarily by Weibo's growing customer base and user engagement. In addition to revenue growth, Weibo's strong presence in China's social media market should help improve the company monetize its user base more effectively.

We have a $54 price estimate for Sina's stock , which is around 10% lower than the current market price. Sina's stock price has fluctuated between $41 and $84 this year. You can modify the interactive charts in the article to gauge how a change in individual drivers can impact our prices estimate for the company.

This comes after Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder signed the bill permitting the testing of autonomous vehicles on Michigan roads.

General Motors plans to test the self-driving Chevy Bolt electric vehicles on the public roadways of Michigan after Snyder agreed to allow the testing of certain parameters for testing and deploying driverless cars in the state. Michigan aims to move ahead of California and other states in a drive to become home to the autonomous car movement. Silicon Valley players including Tesla ( TSLA ), Alphabet ( GOOG )( GOOGL ) and Uber are at the forefront of implementing self-driving technology. The laws provide ride-sharing services to use autonomous cars without human intervention.

Barra made another major announcement that the next generation self-driving cars would be produced in the Orion Township assembly plant, where the company manufactures the all-electric Chevrolet Bolt. The testing vehicles will be equipped with LIDAR, sensors, cameras and other devices for safety. Barra said in a press conference, ""We expect GM will become the first high-volume auto manufacturer to build fully autonomous vehicles in a mass production assembly plant.""

The Detroit automaker has already been testing its driverless vehicle in its Technical Center campus in Warren, Michigan. In total, General Motors has around 40 testing vehicles in the two cities. The automaker now plans to extend its testing to the public roads in the metro area of Detroit. General Motors proposes to make the area its key location for advancing its autonomous technology for winters.

The bill signed by Snyder lays out parameters for testing the technology by establishing regulations on how driverless vehicles could legally run on public roads. The enacted law permits testing of vehicles without human intervention and without steering wheels or pedals.

However, there are certain challenges that driverless cars would have to face. During winters, snowfall can cause the roads to be unclear and such tough road conditions would make the movement of cars not driven by humans unpredictable.

Push toward going autonomous

General Motors' moves in the last 18 months have clearly displayed its aggression in developing the autonomous technology. The carmaker's announcement regarding its partnership with startup firm Lyft and acquisition of Cruise Automation are among its latest initiatives in advancing its autonomous technology.

The automaker has been fueling its effort to develop a strong robust autonomous technology. This can be validated through the company's latest partnership and acquisition moves. In addition, General Motors has also been testing prototypes in Arizona and California. At the press conference, Barra displayed the electric Chevrolet Bolt with rooftop sensors, which is designed to assist autonomous driving.

General Motors has been working hard to build a foolproof driverless technology. The company's management hasn't disclosed when General Motors will begin testing without a human driver but expects it to happen over the next two years. General Motors also plans to begin operating a fleet of self-driving taxis, which would be allowed under the Michigan law.

According to mobile analytics and advertising firm Flurry, owned by Yahoo (YHOO), Apple accounted for some 44% of smartphone and tablet activations during the holiday, dominating its competitors such as Samsung (SSNLF), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL). Though Apple did suffer a five-percentage point decline from last year's 49.1% share, Apple's 2016 Christmas performance more than doubled that of Samsung devices, which took second place with a 20% share.

Notably, Samsung's 2016 holiday performance marks a slight year-over-year increase (19.8% in 2015) even as the South Korean tech giant suffered from exploding batteries, which forced it to recall millions of its Galaxy smartphones. And for the first time since Flurry began reporting its findings, Microsoft, which has struggled to make inroads in mobile, fell off the list. It was replaced by Huawei, which cracked the list for the first time and accounting for 3% of device activations.

All told, with Apple and Samsung taking 44% and 20%, respectively, everyone else, including LG, Amazon (AMZN), Xiaomi and Motorola, were left fighting over the 5% share of activations that were left. In the case of Apple, to the extent to which its device dominance translates to a happy new year for investors ... well, that remains to be seen. But if the strength of iPhone and iPad sales serves as indication, Apple, which is due to report first quarter results in mid-January, is poised to unwrap an earnings and revenue beat.

Where Apple prospered, Google fizzled, or pixelated -- to more accurate. The search giant, which earlier this year unveiled its new Pixel and Pixel XL phones, might as well not have done so. It seemed nobody cared. The devices were somewhat a nonevent during the holiday, according to Flurry. But depending on who you ask, Google's sales struggle could be because it didn't have enough supply to meet demand. We won't know for certain until management discusses Pixel sales specifics next month when the company reports fourth quarter results. But do they want to throw good money after bad?

Speaking of good money, the investments made to revive phablet sales have begun to pay huge dividends. Flurry noted that the number of phablets activated in the week leading up to Christmas grew 37%, marking jump of 10 percentage points from last year and an almost tripled the 13% recorded two years ago. The moral of the story? For Apple and Samsung or any other hardware vendor looking to secure market share, customers believe size still matters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the euphoric phase of smartwatch mania has come and gone, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ) is in the unusual position of just now getting serious about the market.

Source: Brad Moon

It's launching not one but two second-generation Android-powered, wrist-worn devices in early 2017 .

Other manufacturers are also expected to unveil smartwatches based on the Android operating system during the coming year, distinguishing its smartwatch business model from the one employed by Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Only Apple makes smartwatches that utilize the iOS operating system.

Will Alphabet do what Apple wasn't able to do, which is measurably improve the value of GOOGL stock by tapping into the relatively new category of consumer technology?

Maybe, but if it does, it's going to take a massive paradigm shift that hasn't even come close to taking shape yet.

Numbers Don't Lie

Most owners of GOOGL stock may not even realize that Google actually beat Apple to the smartwatch market by launching one in 2014. Indeed, that's a key tenet of the problem. If people don't realize Alphabet makes such a device already, it's because the company has done a poor job of marketing itself.

Fortunately for Alphabet shareholders, this shouldn't be an impasse with the upcoming unveilings.

Unfortunately, better marketing and more consumer familiarity with the idea of wearables isn't going to help much.

See, the smartwatch market is not a significant market for companies that drive tens of billions of dollars worth of revenue per year selling goods and services other than smartwatches. As of the most recent tally, only 39.5 million U.S. adults are expected to be smartwatch users by the end of the year . Initial estimates from a year ago said that figure would be 63.7 million.

For comparison, as of the end of last year, 68% of the nation's 242 million adults own smartphones . That's 164 million smartphone owners, most of whom just don't see the advantage of yet another piece of technology on their person.

We're seeing comparable metrics on a global basis.

What's It Going to Take?

To answer the overarching question of marketability, look at the feedback consumers have served up about the Apple Watch and other smartwatches. Each device has some rabid fan because … well, there's always someone who finds something to love about anything. But some of the criticisms have been repeatedly voiced.

One criticism? It simply didn't do enough to improve or ease the user's life. Another reason owners stopped using them is rooted in the complicated (and small) interface.

Consumers who have yet to buy one have suggested the same concerns as reasons for not purchasing a smartwatch … they just don't see much point.

Both balks underscore a key headwind for all smartwatches. That is, form matters just as much as function, and the necessarily tiny device's form doesn't deliver enough reasonable function. Even if the electronics could be further shrunk, wearer's fingers aren't going to shrink. Vision isn't going to improve (watch face/screens are small). And any advanced electronic device is still going to require lots of button-pushing per function, yet still won't be able to do it all as well as a smartphone counterpart does.

There's the rub for any hope that GOOGL stock will be catapulted by its new smartwatches - the device causes more problems than it solves .

Until and unless Alphabet/Google comes up with a device that's a decidedly better tool than a phone, a smartwatch won't be a game-changer for consumers or for their makers. And there's nothing about the upcoming Android watches that says any of the devices are going to cause such a paradigm shift.

Bottom Line for Google Stock

To be fair, even the first generation of Google's watch was impressive. Ditto for Apple. Expectations weren't terribly high, though, and now that most consumers have seen them, the reaction has mostly become ""meh.""

It's not a reason to avoid owning GOOGL stock. Indeed, yours truly here has pegged Alphabet stock as one of the few must-have names to own in the coming year . But that bullishness had nothing do with success in the smartwatch arena. It was rooted in everything else Alphabet does well.

Any shareholders looking for Alphabet to perform above and beyond current expectations on the back of new smartwatches are going to be disappointed.

Now in her third decade at Google and entering her fourth year as YouTube's CEO, the 48-year-old executive has the best shot in 2017 to prove YouTube can translate its huge audience into more revenue and to lead the remaking of television into a video-everywhere model that appeals to a younger generation weaned on smartphones and Netflix.

It feels cruel to ding a business that has more than a billion monthly users globally, has become a verb and generates multiple billions of dollars in revenue each year. Yet Wojcicki hasn't changed the fact that YouTube helped popularize digital video but hasn't yet lived up to its enormous financial potential.

TV Loses Its Crown Internet ads, including those on YouTube, are expected to overtake TV in 2017 as the world's biggest advertising medium Sources: Estimates from ZenithOptimedia and Bloomberg Intelligence

Consider this: Facebook Inc. is on track to generate more than $27 billion in revenue this year, nearly all from advertising messages on Facebook and Instagram. That will work out to an average of about $16 for each person using Facebook and its sister app, Facebook Messenger.

Parent company Alphabet Inc. doesn’t disclose YouTube’s revenue or specific user numbers, but we can make some rough assumptions. Research firm eMarketer estimates YouTube will generate about $5.58 billion in 2016 revenue, excluding the share of advertising dollars YouTube splits with the companies that make its web videos and with distribution partners. If YouTube has somewhere between 1.2 billion and 1.65 billion monthly users, that is roughly $3.50 to $5 in revenue from each user.

Granted, YouTube's business model is different from that of Facebook or Google web search. For one, YouTube doles out a significant chunk of its revenue to the creators of many of its videos. But the gap exists, and it spotlights the broad challenge for Wojcicki: YouTube could be so much more as the world's biggest web video hangout tethered to the internet's best money machine.

The opportunity is there if Wojcicki can take advantage of it, because the winds are blowing in YouTube's favor. Younger people are spending less time watching traditional television and more time glued to their smartphones -- including YouTube. Advertising revenue will eventually follow those viewers into digital video hangouts.

Wojcicki has also continued YouTube's success in reshaping entertainment by coaxing large media companies such as NBC Universal to devote more programming to YouTube, and by minting YouTube personalities like PewDiePie and Lilly Singh, whose videos can draw more people than those from traditional entertainment companies.

Stay Tuned YouTube's opportunity is to close the gap between the share of time Americans spend watching digital video compared with television, and the relatively outsized share of advertising dollars spent on TV Source: Bloomberg Intelligence and eMarketer

Fulfilling YouTube's potential lies in building a bridge to television, where 40 percent of advertising budgets are spent and where the rules of the game have sometimes eluded Google. Yes, huge audience size matters, but so does the mix of large numbers of people, the kind of people that the advertisers want to pitch to, and the shelter of programming that advertisers want to get behind. Google and YouTube have never fully embraced the rules of so-called brand advertising.

Under Wojcicki, YouTube has been working to change that. YouTube two years ago started to let advertisers plant their commercial messages next to popular video channels from professional entertainment companies or personalities, separate from the flood of mass market videos. It's not perfect, but the new advertiser option made YouTube operate a bit more like TV, and analysts say the ad rates YouTube generates are in the same range as television ad prices.

YouTube is working with the advertising industry on standardizing viewership ratings across traditional television and web video -- another step to get advertisers comfortable with YouTube. YouTube is also creating a new business model, with the creation of its first significant subscription video service -- and soon to be a second -- including programming exclusive to YouTube. That makes YouTube dip into the same business as cable television and Netflix.

Even while the winds are at YouTube's back, it has more competition than ever for people's leisure time and advertisers' money. Facebook, Netflix, Snapchat, AT&T, Twitter, Amazon, Verizon, Apple and many of the traditional TV networks are also vying at least to some degree with their own digital video features, and in some cases for the same crop of professional new media stars and the advertising money that follows.

Wojcicki has in her favor Google’s limitless resources, and growing credit from advertisers for catering to their needs. YouTube has already changed entertainment and the internet. Now for YouTube to get to the next level, Wojcicki has to bridge the canyon between the worlds of TV and the web. No pressure.

It’s launching not one but two second-generation Android-powered, wrist-worn devices in early 2017.

Other manufacturers are also expected to unveil smartwatches based on the Android operating system during the coming year, distinguishing its smartwatch business model from the one employed by Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Only Apple makes smartwatches that utilize the iOS operating system.

Will Alphabet do what Apple wasn’t able to do, which is measurably improve the value of GOOGL stock by tapping into the relatively new category of consumer technology?

Maybe, but if it does, it’s going to take a massive paradigm shift that hasn’t even come close to taking shape yet.

Numbers Don’t Lie

Most owners of GOOGL stock may not even realize that Google actually beat Apple to the smartwatch market by launching one in 2014. Indeed, that’s a key tenet of the problem. If people don’t realize Alphabet makes such a device already, it’s because the company has done a poor job of marketing itself.

Fortunately for Alphabet shareholders, this shouldn’t be an impasse with the upcoming unveilings.

Unfortunately, better marketing and more consumer familiarity with the idea of wearables isn’t going to help much.

See, the smartwatch market is not a significant market for companies that drive tens of billions of dollars worth of revenue per year selling goods and services other than smartwatches. As of the most recent tally, only 39.5 million U.S. adults are expected to be smartwatch users by the end of the year. Initial estimates from a year ago said that figure would be 63.7 million.

For comparison, as of the end of last year, 68% of the nation’s 242 million adults own smartphones. That’s 164 million smartphone owners, most of whom just don’t see the advantage of yet another piece of technology on their person.

We’re seeing comparable metrics on a global basis.

What’s It Going to Take?

To answer the overarching question of marketability, look at the feedback consumers have served up about the Apple Watch and other smartwatches. Each device has some rabid fan because … well, there’s always someone who finds something to love about anything. But some of the criticisms have been repeatedly voiced.

The brokerage firm also waxed optimistic on, saying the company is ""extremely well positioned,"" and cited ""enthusiasm among its advertisers"" over changes to its core search. However, at least one analyst more recently expressed reservations about the Google Pixel smartphone.Specifically, Flurry Analytics looked at the most popular smartphone brands in the week leading up to Christmas. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was in the lead thanks to its iPhone, followed by Samsung, Huawei, and LG. However, GOOGL was noticeably absent. ""With only two devices, the Pixel and Pixel XL, and mixed market reception, Google struggled to drum up excitement this holiday season,"" Flurry opined.This isn't the only space in which Alphabet has struggled to win supporters. In the options pits, too, trading activity has tilted in an unusually bearish direction. The stock's 10-day put/call volume ratio of 0.91 at the International Securities Exchange (ISE), Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX) sits just 1 percentage point from a 12-month peak. Echoing this, GOOGL's Schaeffer's put/call open interest ratio (SOIR) of 0.97 ranks in the top quartile of all readings from the past year.Whether bullish or bearish, short-term options traders can score a bargain at the moment. GOOGL's Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) of 17% sits at an annual low. In other words, options in the front three-months' series are pricing in extremely low volatility expectations.Technically speaking, though, there hasn't been much to see on the charts. For the past five months, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has been chopping sideways around the $800 level, last seen at $800.79. In fact, the post-election boost that most stocks have seen hasn't benefited GOOGL shares, which are actually lower relative to their Nov. 8 close.

(GOOGL) to investors, the conglomerate’s chairman, Larry Page, wrote that “the whole point is that Alphabet companies should have independence and develop their own brands.” The newly named company, Alphabet, was the grown-up Google, which had diverse interests and money-making ventures.

At the end of Alphabet’s first year as a conglomerate, things have not turned out as Page had anticipated.

Google Is Still the Soul

Google still remains the heart and soul of the company and the search engine mints money for the conglomerate. For example, the Mountain View company reported revenues of $22.2 billion in the latest quarter on the back of mobile and video advertising.

To put that into context, rival Facebook Inc. (FB) reported revenues of $17.9 billion for the entire year of 2015. Google is essentially the bank from which other ventures within the Alphabet umbrella borrow money to finance themselves. (See also: Google's Six Most Profitable Lines Of Business.)

Struggling Ventures

But the individual brands that Page referenced in his introductory letter will take time to come into their own. They did not make news for all the right reasons in 2016.

In June, the New York Times reported that Nest founder and CEO Tony Fadell had quote the company after leadership problems. The company is a maker of hardware products and had been acquired by Google $3.2 billion back in 2014. Another casualty within the Alphabet umbrella was Google Fiber, the company’s broadband division. According to an October report in The New York Times, the company dismissed its 130 employees and stopped expansion to other cities.

Scaled-Back Ambitions

Google also scaled back its ambitions of manufacturing a self-driving car after it failed to find a manufacturing partner. Instead, the self-driving unit was spun out into a separate software unit – called Waymo - that partners with established car manufacturers to install self-driving car technology. (See also: Google Spins Off New Self-Driving Car Technology.)

Perhaps the overarching theme in these news bits is Alphabet’s attempts to rein in profligate spending, a quality that separates the company from its contemporaries. The entry of Ruth Porat from Morgan Stanley has brought about this change.

A July report in the Wall Street Journal detailed Porat's efforts to pare spending by spending more judiciously on research and cutting back on profligate hiring. She has also forced divisions within the conglomerate to reconsider their moonshots within the context of costs and budgeting. A Bloomberg report towards the end of this year detailed how Google X, the company’s moonshots division, instituted cost controls and budgeting after her entry.

Risks and Budgets

This does not mean that Alphabet has become a boring venture aimed at minting money and profits. It was the company’s unpredictability and willingness to take risks that endeared it to investors. The markets reflected that optimism and faith this year, when they pushed it to become the world’s most valuable company, surpassing rival Apple Inc. (AAPL). (See also: Alphabet Is Now Bigger Than Apple).

That said, Alphabet has matured. It’s risk-taking will now be underpinned with greater Wall Street transparency and budgeted timelines, if developments in 2016 are any indication.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The reports are coming in through Google's own forums (see here) and popular third-party communities such as Reddit (here).

Update: A Google spokesperson has told me that ""we're investigating the three reports we've received of battery drain issues on Pixel and we'll get back to you as soon as we have more information.""

The curious feature is the point at which the battery issue kicks in. It appears to happen around the 25 to 35 percent mark, so it's easy to call the error the 'thirty percent battery' issue... a value that will be hauntingly familiar to iPhone users where a similar problem is being worked on by Cupertino.

With a bit of work there's probably a Saturday Night Live sketch in there about Google wanting to follow Apple so closely it even replicates the same bugs, but with the error also showing up in some Nexus 6P handsets it's more likely something in the Android Nougat code than ammunition for Lorne Michaels.

One advantage over previous Android issues is that over-the-air updates for the Pixel and Nexus devices are something that Google has far more control over, compared to other Android-powered handsets. These flagships can be updated in many cases direct from Mountain View, while arrangements with some carriers are in place to expedite critical fixes. Surely power issues and unexpected loss of functionality will allow Google to trigger this fast update route?

I can see this turning into an interesting comparison exercise. Apple has a similar issue with the iPhone, and it has come to light in a similar way through forum reports and online discussion. While the problem is not yet solved, iOS updates have been rolled out which included battery diagnostic tools to report data back to Cupertino.

Google now has a similar situation with the Pixel devices. Can it identify issues, roll out fixes, and communicate these to consumers and exceed Apple's unresponsive approach to publicly acknowledging issues?

Now read how the critics reacted to the Google Pixel when it was released...

One could never confuse International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM ) with Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ) or even Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) for that matter. However, those looking for income in 2017 should put aside all the negativity that has followed IBM stock in recent years and add it to your portfolio.

Here's why.

The key to any good dividend stock is consistently growing dividends. IBM has increased dividends for 21 consecutive years; in the last five years, International Business Machines has averaged annual dividend growth of 13.4%, a positive sign for anyone looking for yields of 3% or higher.

IBM stock currently yields a healthy 3.3% despite its stock being up 21% year-to-date through Dec. 27.

It's especially positive given how much free cash flow the company has been allocating toward share repurchases in recent years. Since 2012, it has reduced its share count by 16.5% to 964 million shares. During those three years, it repurchased $32.2 billion of its stock and paid out another $13 billion in dividends representing 112.4% of its cumulative free cash flow.

It's no secret, then, why International Business Machines' revenues shrunk from $102.9 billion in 2012 to $81.7 billion in 2015 and non-GAAP operating earnings declined by 18% over the same period - a lack of investment in research and development and no meaningful acquisitions to speak of has literally been choking the life out of IBM.

However, all that appears to have changed in 2015, providing dividend investors with a renewed interest in IBM stock.

What's Going on With IBM Stock?

In 2013 and 2014, International Business Machines paid out $18 billion for share repurchases and dividends; in 2015, that dropped to $9.5 billion and so far, through the first three-quarters of 2016, it has shelled out just $6.5 billion, which means the company will have more available to pay down some of its $35.6 billion in long-term debt while still increasing the amount it invests in R&D.

At the height of its free cash flow in 2012, IBM was generating $18.2 billion, paying out 86% of it to shareholders. In 2016, if International Business Machines generates $15 billion in free cash flow and allocates no more than $9 billion to shareholders, it will have paid out just 60% of its free cash flow in the form of dividends and share repurchases, leaving a substantial amount to reinvest in its business.

IBM has been on a journey over the last decade and it still has a lot of work left to regain a prominent place in technology. That said, it has made progress.

In 2005, its gross margin was 40%; today, it's 11 percentage points higher. A big driver of that is its software and services business, which includes the cloud. While its overall revenues are falling, International Business Machines' revenue from strategic imperatives established in 2014 such as big data, analytics, cloud, mobile, social and security are rising.

In 2015, revenue from its strategic imperatives increased by 26% excluding currency to $28.9 billion or 35% of its overall revenue. Its cloud revenue increased 57% in 2015 to $10.2 billion. In Q3 2016, its strategic imperatives generated $8 billion in revenue representing 40% of its total for the quarter.

Its financial model for the long-term looks to generate low single-digit revenue growth, mid-single-digit pre-tax income growth and high single-digit earnings-per-share growth through more share repurchases.

Bottom Line on IBM Stock

But before investors worry about share repurchases getting out of hand as they did in 2013 and 2014, IBM's long-term plan calls for annual dividend increases along with annual share reduction of 2% to 3%.

So, it will be buying back approximately 24 million in IBM stock for the foreseeable future, which works out to $4 billion in annual buybacks - a much more tolerable level.

Although International Business Machines' transformation might not appear to be moving quickly enough, it has made progress in the past two years generating more of the kind of revenue it needs to in order to grow profitably.

With $10 billion in cash on the balance sheet and free cash flow turning higher, IBM stock is reasonably cheap at the moment despite being within 2% of its 52-week high.

If you're an income investor you ought to be begging for International Business Machines stock and its 3.3% yield because you won't get too many deals as good as this one.

As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

During its most recent conference call, CEO Robin Li mentioned AI no fewer than a dozen times, and in a recent speech made this bold pronouncement:

Gone is the era of PC, and soon will we say goodbye to the era of mobile internet ... We believe that coming is the era of artificial intelligence.

Andrew Ng, Baidu's chief scientist, has some experience in this area. During his previous tenure at Google parent Alphabet , he led the Google Brain AI project. He is also an adjunct professor at Stanford University, where he taught AI. In a recent interview , he stated:

AI is very much baked into the DNA [of Baidu]. Recent advances of AI have accelerated our progress and the impact that AI can have.

Deep learning is the area of AI behind all this excitement. With a paradigm shift of this magnitude, a rudimentary understanding of the science might help investors better understand its applications.

So, what is deep learning? In it's simplest form, it is a way to teach computers to learn. Using a software model and algorithms, scientists attempt to replicate the structure and function of the human brain, in an effort to recreate its capacity to learn. The result is an artificial neural network.

Teaching the system takes massive computers and enormous amounts of data. It is fed a multitude of examples, discovers similarities across the examples, and interprets how they are related; it learns to distinguish or differentiate. This process involves hundreds or even thousands of examples and the correct answers for each. The system uses what it learns to solve future equations.

Baidu is the search leader in a country with a base of 700 million internet users. This provides it with the requisite data, and a clear advantage. In a recent article , Mr. Ng had this to say:

Among leading AI teams, many can likely replicate others' software in, at most, 1-2 years. But it is exceedingly difficult to get access to someone else's data. Thus data, rather than software, is the defensible barrier for many businesses.

Baidu began work on AI more than five years ago, and the Baidu Brain is the fruit of that labor. It focuses on four functional areas of deep learning: voice recognition and synthesis, image recognition, natural-language processing, and user profiling. With a multitude of potential applications, Baidu has been implementing these deep-learning capabilities across its ecosystem to drive success in many areas of its business.

Here are three ways Baidu is harnessing deep learning to power its business:

1. To improve user engagement

Baidu is using AI to deliver a better user experience and improve customer satisfaction by making its apps more useful and efficient, beyond optimizing its flagship search.

Image source: Pixabay .

Chinese writing uses thousands of characters, which makes internet searches on a smartphone extremely impractical. Most consumers in China prefer the ease of voice recognition for the task, and Baidu claims a 97% success rate in the field. Its Deep Speech 2 algorithm can, in some cases, recognize English and Mandarin better than people. Its Baidu Translate, based on deep learning, can translate 28 languages and processes, on average, over 100 million requests a day.

Baidu is also using its AI-driven data to suggest customized restaurant and retail suggestions in its online-to-offline platform Nuomi. The data more accurately predicts traffic conditions for users of Baidu Maps, and provides more relevant content for the company's recently launched news feed.

2. To improve efficiency

Baidu's corporate headquarters is incorporating advances gleaned from AI. It uses a voice-recognition-based CRM (customer relationship management) system to field customer questions, and provides sales staff with real-time answers and data. It is also testing a facial-recognition-based entry-control system at Baidu Campus in Beijing.

As Baidu Delivery service (formerly Baidu Takeout Delivery) expands from restaurants to other areas such as fresh-food delivery and on-demand logistics, AI provides better estimates for delivery times. During its most recent quarter, Baidu attributed 150% year-over-year growth in gross merchandise volume for its delivery devision to improvements based on this technology.

3. To pursue new business lines

Image source: Pixabay .

Baidu recently entered the financial-services market. Here, it uses AI-based risk-control techniques including facial and fingerprint recognition, liveliness detection, and optical character recognition of identification documents.

Baidu sees autonomous driving as an important area for future growth. It began testing driverless cars both in China and in California earlier this year. These cars use image recognition and deep-learning-based processing to navigate. Baidu has plans for small-scale mass production of autonomous vehicles by 2018.

The Foolish bottom line

Baidu is leveraging its advantage in AI by implementing the knowledge gained throughout its portfolio of products and services. With applications in voice recognition, search, and much more, it is reaping the benefits of its considerable trove of data. It believes that AI has improved the majority of existing products, increased monetization, and provided better user experiences across the vast array of its consumer-facing products. While the value of these benefits would be difficult to quantify, the result may be priceless.

Facebook (FB) - $118.01, up 12.76% in 2016 - 12-month target $160

Fake news might have dominated the last three months of Facebook's 2016 campaign, but there's nothing fake about the company's profits. The results of its fiscal third quarter, where it posted adjusted earnings of $1.09 per share on revenue of $7.01 billion, was the perfect example. Not only did both measures crush Wall Street estimates for 97 cents per share on $6.92 billion, it marked year-over-year growth of 91% and 56%, respectively.

Facebook's dominant advertising prowess, thanks to almost 2 billion global users on its platform, is matched only by Alphabet's (GOOGL) strong search business. Plus, with the company now boasting more than 1 billion active mobile users, while Q3 average revenue per user rose to $4.01, Facebook's financial power will come into play in 2017. And with the stock down more than 8% in three months, my price 2017 target of $160 is good for 35.5% returns.

Amazon (AMZN) - $771.40, up 14.06% in 2016 - 12-month target $950

As with Facebook, Amazon shares have lost some steam, falling 5.5% in three months. But the e-commerce behemoth, led by billionaire CEO Jeff Bezos, is coming off the all-important holiday quarter, where Amazon has already announced record shipments. From its interest in drone deliveries, its new grocery store concept, long-haul freight trucks, its fleet of airplanes, and a host of other endeavors, Amazon continues to strike fear in the hearts of any market leaders who believes their businesses can't be disrupted.

And we haven't even mentioned the dominance of its cloud computing arm Amazon Web Services, which continued to rake in the big bucks. For the full year, ending December, Amazon is expected to earn $4.76 per share on revenue of $137 billion, marking year-over-year increases of 96% and 28%, respectively. I expect both figures to beat consensus and for Amazon to raise full-year 2017 guidance. Accordingly, AMZN stock, which I expect to reach $950 in 2017, should deliver 23% gains.

Microsoft (MSFT) - $63.28, up 14.13% in 2016 - 12-month target $76

In 2017 Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella will affirm his place as one of the best leaders in the tech industry. While he may never earn the level of respect or perceived a genius in the realm of CEO/founders Mark Zuckerberg or Bezos, Nadella has done something many thought was impossible: Detach Microsoft from the dying PC-dependent business it has been and turning it into a respected cloud juggernaut.

Just as important, because of Nadella, the market has now forgotten how much it hated Microsoft under former CEO Steve Ballmer, who was blamed for missing the mobile trend, which cost Microsoft hundreds of billions of dollars. In 2017 Nadella's biggest job will be to integrate LinkedIn. Are you willing to bet against him? I'm not. MSFT stock will hit $76 in 2017, delivering 20% returns.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Facebook is crushing it

In line with Facebook's recent impressive global growth in monthly active users, the world's largest social network's user base continued to grow handsomely in the company's home U.S. market. Facebook's average monthly active users (MAUs) in the U.S. during 2016 increased 14%, according to Nielsen.

Facebook's Messenger also performed exceptionally, raking in 28% year-over-year growth and coming in second only to Facebook's own native app. Messenger's success follows a year of big investments in the messaging app, including live video, messaging bots, and business integrations. Messenger's 28% growth in U.S. MAUs doesn't necessarily come as a surprise, considering Facebook's global Messenger MAUs increased from 700 million in the third quarter of 2015 to over 1 billion by July.

Instagram. Image source: Instagram.

And Facebook's Instagram was a smash hit in 2016, too. Coming in at number eight on Nielsen's list, the photo- and video-sharing app saw its U.S. MAUs increase 36%.

Further, not only was Facebook's growth notable, but both Facebook and Messenger's 146 million MAUs and 130 million MAUs, respectively, were still well ahead of third-place YouTube's 114 million MAUs.

Alphabet is succeeding on numerous fronts

Google parent company Alphabet continues to shine in terms of the quantity of Google-branded apps making it into Nielsen's top 10, highlighting Alphabet's robust ecosystem of apps for simultaneously serving its customers and generating data for its advertisers. Alphabet's YouTube, Google Maps, Google Search, Google Play, and Gmail all made Nielsen's top-10 list.

Apple Music remains a key player in streaming music

While streaming music company Spotify continues to outperform Apple Music when it comes to paying members across the globe, Apple Music is winning in the U.S. when it comes to unique monthly visitors to the streaming music app. In a nod to the continued success of Apple's streaming music service, Apple Music was number nine on Nielsen's list, clocking a notable 20% year-over-year uptick in monthly active users. Spotify didn't make the list.

This data reflects recent updates about Apple Music from the tech giant. The streaming service's paying subscribers recently surpassed 20 million, Apple said earlier this month. This is up considerably from 10 million in January.

Amazon's soaring growth puts it in the top 10

Thanks to its monstrous 43% growth in monthly active users, Amazon's shopping app made a surprising entrance to Nielsen's top-10 list this year. The app's inclusion in Nielsen's top 10 apps shows how successfully the company has been riding the e-commerce wave in the wake of rising mobile adoption.

Amazon's own data about global usage of its shopping app during the peak holiday season points to a similar trend. Shopping on the company's free mobile Amazon app increased by 56% during this important period, according to an update from the company this week.

These observations reinforce how Facebook, Alphabet, Apple, and Amazon consistently earn customer attention.

Google is the dominant online search engine nearly everywhere in the world except China. China just so happens to be the largest internet population in the world, but censorship laws in the country prevent the Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) company from operating how it would like to there. In its absence, Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU) has built a commanding position, modeling itself off of the global leader in search.

Investors may look to Baidu for the significant growth opportunities that still lie ahead for it as China transitions from 3G mobile internet speeds to 4G and more consumers come online. But the steady growth of Google and its larger global presence may present a better buy right now.

Let's take a look at how they compare.

Revenue growth

Baidu is a much smaller company than Alphabet with a market capitalization of $57 billion compared to $555 billion. And it was growing revenue relatively quickly as it rapidly brought on more advertising customers and its active user count increased.

However, over the last year, revenue growth slowed to a crawl as it has gone back and validated all of its advertisers, weeding out some bad apples. Last quarter, Baidu's total revenue declined 0.7% year over year. If you exclude the impact of Qunar, the online travel search engine it sold its stake in earlier this year, revenue grew a modest 6.7% year over year last quarter. Over the trailing 12 months, Baidu's revenue grew just 3%.

Baidu does expect revenue growth to return next year as it finishes validating its advertisers. Still, the company has experienced slowing revenue growth for several years now.

By comparison, Alphabet's revenue grew 14% over the last year. In fact, the company's revenue growth is accelerating. During the third quarter, Alphabet reported 23% revenue growth on a constant currency basis, up from 21% growth the year before. Most importantly, Alphabet's revenue growth has remained relatively steady over the last several years even as it's become one of the largest revenue generators in the world.

Earnings growth

Google's parent company is also better at turning its revenue into profits. Alphabet's profit margin through the first nine months of 2016 was 22%. Baidu posted a profit margin of just 14%.

Again, Baidu has the potential to improve margins if and when its current investments in its varied market opportunities pay off. Sales, marketing, general, and administrative expenses amounted to 32% of Baidu's revenue in the third quarter. Alphabet, by comparison, spent just 20% of revenue on SG&A expenses last quarter.

Analysts currently expect Baidu to grow earnings per share 33% next year. That's slightly better than expectations for Alphabet, which is anticipated to grow 19%. But where analysts expect Alphabet to continue growing at a fairly steady 19% clip over the next five years, they see Baidu's earnings declining an average of 2% per year over the next five years.

Valuation

Despite the poor long-term outlook for Baidu, investors are still giving it a premium price. Shares currently trade for 29 times next year's earnings expectations. By comparison, Alphabet shares trade for just 19 times next year's earnings expectations.

Baidu's sales are slightly discounted to Alphabet's with a price-to-sales ratio of 4.7, compared to 5.3 for Alphabet. But with Baidu's slowing sales growth, the discount ought to be much bigger.

The relatively cheap valuation of Alphabet combined with its steady revenue growth and higher profit margin make it a better buy right now than Baidu. Baidu has a lot of potential, but as it transitions out its advertiser validation, it needs to prove it can attract more legitimate advertisers to its platform and grow their average spend. Alphabet just needs to keep doing what it's doing.

(NYSE: IBM ) with Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ) or even Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) for that matter. However, those looking for income in 2017 should put aside all the negativity that has followed IBM stock in recent years and add it to your portfolio.

Here’s why.

The key to any good dividend stock is consistently growing dividends. IBM has increased dividends for 21 consecutive years; in the last five years, International Business Machines has averaged annual dividend growth of 13.4%, a positive sign for anyone looking for yields of 3% or higher.

IBM stock currently yields a healthy 3.3% despite its stock being up 21% year-to-date through Dec. 27.

It’s especially positive given how much free cash flow the company has been allocating toward share repurchases in recent years. Since 2012, it has reduced its share count by 16.5% to 964 million shares. During those three years, it repurchased $32.2 billion of its stock and paid out another $13 billion in dividends representing 112.4% of its cumulative free cash flow.

It’s no secret, then, why International Business Machines’ revenues shrunk from $102.9 billion in 2012 to $81.7 billion in 2015 and non-GAAP operating earnings declined by 18% over the same period — a lack of investment in research and development and no meaningful acquisitions to speak of has literally been choking the life out of IBM.

However, all that appears to have changed in 2015, providing dividend investors with a renewed interest in IBM stock.

What’s Going on With IBM Stock?

In 2013 and 2014, International Business Machines paid out $18 billion for share repurchases and dividends; in 2015, that dropped to $9.5 billion and so far, through the first three-quarters of 2016, it has shelled out just $6.5 billion, which means the company will have more available to pay down some of its $35.6 billion in long-term debt while still increasing the amount it invests in R&D.

At the height of its free cash flow in 2012, IBM was generating $18.2 billion, paying out 86% of it to shareholders. In 2016, if International Business Machines generates $15 billion in free cash flow and allocates no more than $9 billion to shareholders, it will have paid out just 60% of its free cash flow in the form of dividends and share repurchases, leaving a substantial amount to reinvest in its business.

IBM has been on a journey over the last decade and it still has a lot of work left to regain a prominent place in technology. That said, it has made progress.

In 2005, its gross margin was 40%; today, it’s 11 percentage points higher. A big driver of that is its software and services business, which includes the cloud. While its overall revenues are falling, International Business Machines’ revenue from strategic imperatives established in 2014 such as big data, analytics, cloud, mobile, social and security are rising.

In 2015, revenue from its strategic imperatives increased by 26% excluding currency to $28.9 billion or 35% of its overall revenue. Its cloud revenue increased 57% in 2015 to $10.2 billion. In Q3 2016, its strategic imperatives generated $8 billion in revenue representing 40% of its total for the quarter.

Not unlike, say, when powerhouse FANG stocks Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet (GOOGL) lit up the market in 2015. But with year-to-date gains of almost 14%, compared to 9% rise in the Nasdaq Composite Index, there's little for tech investors to complain about.

Here's the thing, however: Unlike 2015, FANG stocks this year didn't do the heavy lifting and more of the wealth was shared among other tech names. The FANGs lost tons of bite and were pretty pedestrian in 2016. Take a look at the chart a few graphs below.

After gaining 141% last year, Netflix shares have risen just 10% in 2016, marking the biggest drop among the FANGs on a percentage basis. This was followed by Amazon, which has gained about 12.5% year to date, falling from 120% returns last year.

Meanwhile, Facebook and Alphabet, which have posted respective 2016 gains of 12% and 4%, struggled to duplicate their 2015 respective returns of 37% and 49%.

In all four cases, expecting these companies to repeat their 2015 success would have been unrealistic. But with three out of the four names besting the or -- at least -- tracking the S&P 500 Index's 10% rise, the group didn't stink up the joint. And while Alphabet's 4% rise would seem as a disappointment, take it as a buying opportunity. I expect next year's recap will yield better results.

All told, the FANGs were displaced by the likes AMD (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA), which posted respective gains of 303% and 235%. Add in Qualcomm's (QCOM) 38% rise and you've got a nice chip party. All that's missing is the dip and soft drinks. Speaking of soft, Microsoft (MSFT), which rose 17% in 2016, seems rejuvenated under CEO Satya Nadella's cloud-first strategy. While 17% is nothing to brag about compared to AMD, Microsoft stock will end 2016 at near tech-bubble highs.

Likewise, IBM (IBM), which has soared some 26% this year, will end the year as one of tech's biggest surprises. Raise your had if you saw Big Blue posting such green. Notably, despite suffering iPhone revenue and shipment declines, the fact that Apple (AAPL) has gained 13% in 2016 underscores the level of optimism investors have about 2017. It remains to be seen whether Apple can deliver. But with some $230 billion in cash on the balance sheet, a 2.00% dividend yield and new products on the way, taking a bite out of Apple never seems like a bad idea.

By contrast, despite Twitter's (TWTR) 28% decline, it will be tough for the company to turn things around in 2017. Same with GoPro (GPRO), which lost some 50% of its value in 2016. But if either company gets acquired in 2017, all bets are off.

Two stocks to keep an eye on are Intel (INTC) and Cisco (CSCO). Both pay respective dividend yields of 2.8% and 3.4% and are making strong headway in the Internet-of-Things, which is expected to be a huge market in 2017.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As should be no surprise, Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ) had another eventful year.

Source: Mike Lau via Flickr (Modified)

The company dealt with production issues with the Model X as demand surged. Then there was the mega acquisition of SolarCity, as well as the announcement of nearly 400,000 advance deposits for the Model 3.

Now, fresh off of the holiday season, traders are bidding Tesla stock up on a deal with Panasonic Corporation (ADR) (OTCMKTS: PCRFY ) to drop more than 30 billion yen (about $256 million USD) on a Tesla production facility to make photovoltaic cells and modules.

Today's 3%-plus move exemplifies the broader theme - TSLA stock is erratic. In 2016, Tesla had a range of $144 to $265 - with the year-to-date loss coming to 8%. That's disappointing considering the markets have ended the year on a very bullish note. It's important to keep in mind, however, that Tesla stock has had a long run of strong gains. During the past five years, compound annual growth hit a staggering 50%.

So what kind of opportunity are we looking at with Tesla stock? Well, to see, let's consider three pros and cons on Tesla stock.

TSLA Stock Pros

Innovation: Tesla Motors has made major breakthroughs in battery technologies (allowing for drives of over 300 miles on a single charge), electric powertrains and software systems. Yet the company has also been innovative with its business model, such as having online purchases of vehicles as well company-owned showrooms and service centers. The result is that Tesla has direct connections with its customers and better control on quality service.

Interestingly enough, a Tesla car is kind of like an app. That is, there are periodic updates to the systems with ""over-the-air"" transmissions. This has definitely been key with the Autopilot technology, which allows for semi-autonomous driver assistance. So is it any wonder that Forbes currently ranks Tesla as the world's most innovative company ? Not really.

Megatrend: The auto industry is in the midst of major technology changes. Companies like Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ), Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM ) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC ) have made big investments and acquisitions in the category. Of course, the main focus is on autonomous driving. According to research from Mobileye NV (NYSE: MBLY ), the market could hit $15 billion within the next few years.

All this is certainly good news for holders of TSLA stock. The company has been investing in new-fangled auto technologies since 2003. What's more, the Autopilot hardware has logged over 1.3 billion miles so far. In other words, Tesla has a major advantage in terms of data and analytics. But the growth is likely to ramp for some time. For the second half of 2016, TSLA expects to ship 50,000 cars , which is roughly the same amount for all of last year.

The Elon Factor: At 45, Musk is already a legend of the tech industry. Besides Tesla, he has launched other breakout companies, such as Zip2, Paypal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL ), SolarCity and SpaceX. Along the way, Musk has made billions for shareholders. Unlike many in Silicon Valley, though, he is not only technically super smart but has incredible marketing chops. Oh, and he is not afraid of ""going big."" Let's face it, how many people have the goal of eventually living on Mars? Such qualities have inspired Musk's workforce, which has led to amazing achievements.

TSLA Stock Cons

SolarCity Deal: On Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR ), Musk sent out the following regarding the acquisition: ""Tesla + SolarCity future: solar roofs + batteries + electric cars."" Definitely ambitious, right? Of course. But there has still been quite a bit of skepticism on the Street.

One of the issues is that SolarCity has been a big-time money loser. For the past year, the company has reported nearly $2 billion in negative operating cash flows . Keep in mind that there are heavy capital costs and marketing expenditures. The competitive environment is also intense and there are concerns that the regulatory environment could get tougher. Let's face it, the Donald Trump Administration may not be too interested in maintaining tax credits for solar energy projects.

In light of all this, analysts at Morgan Stanley provided the following grim assessment : ""Given (SolarCity's) financial condition and recent reduction in guidance, we have assumed zero value for (SolarCity) equity to (Tesla) shareholders.""

Valuation: Even with the recent drop, TSLA stock is still far from cheap. The multiple is at about six times sales. No doubt, this is at quite a premium to traditional auto manufacturers. Consider that General Motors Company (NYSE: GM ) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F ) sport multiples at about 0.3 or so.

It's true that the premium valuation for TSLA is due to the strong growth ramp. And there is lots of value for the intellectual property. But then again, profitability has remained elusive. If anything, TSLA will likely continue to voraciously raise capital to meet production targets, build the massive Gigafactory and fund SolarCity. In other words, there will likely be ongoing dilution for shareholders.

Perhaps this is why short sellers have been targeting TSLA stock. Right now, the short interest is at a hefty 40% of the float, which certainly indicates that many investors are expecting a fall in the value of the shares.

Production Issues: Demand has not really been a problem for Tesla. Instead, the real challenge has been to produce enough vehicles. After all, the company has a limited number of facilities - and technical complexities are mind-boggling. It seems inevitable that there will be snags. Yet the biggest problem may be to achieve profitability on a unit basis. According to a recent 152-slide presentation from hedge fund manager Mark Spiegel , the Tesla Model 3 could cost $48,000 to produce. However, the company has plans to sell it at $35,000!

All in all, this seems like a pretty good deal for customers - but not for holders of TSLA stock. Granted, TSLA may ultimately decide to hike the price. But this could mean a drop in sales. No doubt, this essentially highlights the extreme difficulties of succeeding in the mass market.

Bottom Line on TSLA Stock

Musk has always had many doubters - and he has had a knack for proving them wrong. And so far, he has done a tremendous job with TSLA. It's actually downright amazing that he was somehow able to stave off bankruptcy during the financial crisis.

But going forward, TSLA will deal with its biggest challenges - such as selling into the mass market and also managing a solar energy company. Just doing one would be incredibly tough. In other words, there is really not much margin for error.

OK then, should you buy Tesla stock? No, not for now - the risks just seem to high, especially in light of the valuation.

Ask anybody how Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) makes its money and, chances are, they'll say it's an online retailer. There's no denying that the company is a behemoth in the e-commerce space and all but invented the category back in the go-go days of the dot-com boom. It's also a fact that Amazon still gets the bulk of its revenue from online sales.

Source: Atomic Taco Via Flickr

But, there's more driving AMZN stock than just online sales.

Jeff Bezos and Company have created an interesting web services business on the side. Through its own data collection efforts, Amazon has continued to expand on that premise and is now one of the rising stars in cloud computing and data analytics. It's in these projects that AMZN could see the biggest growth down the road.

For investors, the continued growth in its web services and data center division might be the most promising driver of AMZN stock over the long term. It's pretty clear that Amazon is much more than just another retailer.

It's All About Data at AMZN

Believe it or not, Amazon and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ) have a lot in common. Yes, one is a search/advertising company and the other is a retailer. But, they share a love of data. A lot of it. Terabytes worth of information.

Every time you perform a search on Google or send an email via Gmail, Google is quietly searching through all your information, using complex algorithms to tease out whatever information it can. Advertisers love this info and it's what has made GOOGL a powerhouse.

Guess what? AMZN is doing it too.

Every time you search, buy, or buy again, Amazon is collecting millions of pieces of information. The company stores and processes that information on its vast server computers. For years, AMZN quietly did all of this collection and analyzation behind the scenes. But, one day, Bezos and his cohorts had a thought: ""If we're collecting and searching through all this data, I bet someone else is, too."" And, just like that, the Amazon's Web Services (AWS) division was born.

Initially, AWS was simply an outsourced server farm. You could contact Amazon to host your business processes on one of its data center sites and access it via the cloud. Thousands of smaller businesses flocked to this easy-to-access ""public cloud"" as the costs to implement it vs. the cost of building out an entire IT infrastructure are next to nil. Revenue for AWS has grown more than 55% year over year.

AMZN Stock Hooks the Big Boys

But, just offering a space for storage isn't the end of Amazon's cloud computing endeavors. AMZN has continued to build an entire ecosystem of tools and software designed to massage its customers own data analytics, as well as provide access to some of its generated data. Since 2014 (when the business launched) Amazon has added over 500 features and software tools.

Its latest pushes are designed to attract Fortune 500 companies to its cloud services.

These include a host of new artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning products, as well as a new managed services offering. This allows customers to offload the boring, mundane tasks such as updating software, patching systems and similar IT chores. Believe or not, using a data center doesn't get you access to these sorts of tasks. Companies still need to do it themselves.

This is a huge differentiating point for AMZN vs. cloud rivals such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ). More importantly, these services have been designed with Amazon's overall mantra in mind: save customers money. Businesses can fire their entire IT staff and save bundles by switching to AMZN's services.

Heck, Amazon will even drive over a 100-petabyte mobile hard drive to help corporate clients upload their data to AMZN's cloud.

All of these efforts seem to be working to attract corporate clients. Amazon's case studies include Kellogg Company (NYSE: K ) using AMZN's data analytics to improve commodity trading, and drug maker Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE ) improving its R&D to more efficiently answer consumer questions.

The Big Win for AMZN Stock

It's clear that retail operations still run the show at AMZN, but the new AWS division is what's really driving growth. As it is able to plug more big corporate clients into its system, the potential at Amazon is huge.

Right now, AWS accounts for less than 10% of Amazon's revenue. Shopping still rules the roost. But, margins at AWS are crazily high as, once it's in place, Amazon doesn't have to do much. As a result, last quarter, the company's cloud services division contributed roughly 75% of overall profit.

If Amazon is able boost revenue from the sector - and it should because SaaS applications and web-hosting is a fee based business, not a one-time sale - profits from AWS should continue to soar. In the end, cloud computing could be the real driver for AMZN stock, and retail sales might eventually become the side business.

For investors looking at AMZN stock today, its future continues to be tied to cloud computing. Don't think of Amazon as merely a play on e-commerce.

The Bottom Line

It's no secret that Amazon is a monster retailer. But, what will really drive AMZN stock over the long term is its cloud computing division. Margins and profits here are what dot-com dreams are made of. At the end of the day, Amazon's future will be all about the cloud.

Picking the right stocks for your nest egg while you're in your 40s can make a huge difference in providing a financially comfortable retirement. With anywhere between two and three decades to go until you call it quits on the working world, you should be looking for stocks that share two key traits: dominance and optionality in their fields, and the potential to pay a dividend in the future.

Most financial experts would argue that paying a dividend now is more important, and that's certainly not a bad stance to take. However, I think the most relevant companies -- and the ones most rewarding to shareholders -- come 2041 have yet to start paying dividends. Owning a piece of Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) , Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , or Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) can help ensure both capital gains and the potential for dividend payments...come retirement time.

What the heck is optionality?

Dominance within a field is pretty easy to understand, but what in the world does optionality mean? Before I answer that, let's firmly establish that all three of these companies are dominant.

Alphabet's Google owns 75% of the global desktop search market share, and an astounding 92% of mobile search globally, according to Net Market Share.

Facebook's monthly active users has now eclipsed 1.75 billion people, or likely over 50% of all people with regular Internet access!

It may be hard to believe, but e-commerce accounts for just 8.4% of all U.S. sales. There's lots of room for growth, and Amazon is capturing the lion's share of it. According to Forrester Research, Amazon captured 60% of all e-commerce growth in 2015.

But let's get to that second part: optionality. In short, companies that embrace optionality realize the pace of change in the world is accelerating. The ability to know what will be relevant tomorrow has diminished, and only those that are light on their feet and able to adapt will survive.

The ideal mode for addressing this uncertainty is -- quite simply -- a trial and error approach. Companies that embrace learning via small failures will be the most relevant tomorrow. By accepting the pain of non-fatal errors, companies can expose themselves to ideas that can spawn entire new industries.

Consider that Amazon started out only selling books. Then it moved to media. Then it added merchandise. Then it added an e-reader. From there it has moved on to groceries, tablets, and now -- the real cash cow -- cloud hosting. Along the way, founder and CEO Jeff Bezos has embraced trial and error, and it has proved enormously valuable for shareholders.

Last year, Google changed its name to Alphabet to emphasize its stance on optionality (Alpha-bet). While the advertising dollars from Google still make up almost all of the company's sales, its moonshot projects -- including Nest, Calico, and driverless cars -- have the potential to create huge new businesses, while their failures will not render Alphabet dead in the water.

Facebook hasn't taken quite as dramatic a stance on optionality but it still has lots of ways to remain relevant in the future. When the company went public, it had just its namesake platform. But that has expanded rapidly to four uber-popular services -- Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp -- and Oculus VR has the potential to join the list in the coming years.

But optionality isn't enough

While I am confident all three have the type of optionality in their DNA that's necessary to remain relevant for decades to come, that alone isn't enough to recommend buying shares for a 40-something's nest egg. The second piece comes from dividend-paying potential.

While none of these three currently offers a payout, it wouldn't surprise me at all if they started doing so between now and when you decide to retire. But by getting in now, the actual yield you'll be getting on your purchase price will be much higher than if you waited.

For example, let's assume you buy Facebook now at $120. It starts paying a $5 dividend ten years from now. Because the stock has appreciated so much (it's worth $500 in 2026), its yield is only 1%. But since you bought at $120, you're getting a 4.2% yield on your original purchase price.

By looking at the growing cash hoard of Alphabet and Facebook, it's not hard to see how a dividend could easily be in the offing.

Data source: SEC filings. Growing Cash Hoards At... Create column charts

I'll be the first to admit that -- right now -- Amazon doesn't seem nearly as likely to offer a dividend. Facebook and Alphabet have seen phenomenal growth in their cash hoards, and neither sports any significant long-term debt. Amazon's growth has been far more tepid, and it has $8.2 billion in debt to boot.

That being said, this is simply part of Jeff Bezos' long-term strategy. By the time he's done building his moat around Amazon -- if that time ever comes -- he will have such operating leverage that I don't think it would take long at all to extinguish the company's debt and start raking in free cash flow at levels we haven't seen the company accomplish...yet.

That's why I think anyone in their 40s who is trying to build out a winning nest egg would be wise to include all three players in their portfolio. And lest you think these are empty words, my skin is in the game: these three combine to form 45% of my real-life holdings!

Two FANG stocks, Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet (GOOGL), neared buy points Tuesday along with Apple (AAPL), while Amazon (AMZN) approached a key support level and Facebook (FB) continued its struggle.

Apple plus the FANG stocks — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google-owner Alphabet — are among the most closely watched tech stocks.

Apple closed at 117.25, up 0.6%, in the stock market today. Apple has risen for 13 of the last 15 trading sessions and is approaching a 118.79 buy point. A technical buy point comes amid reports that Apple is taking steps to increase its presence in India.

Making products locally would allow Apple to open its own stores in India, a country where it has less than a 5% share of the booming smartphone market. Apple currently sells its devices through Indian-owned distributors and retailers.

IBD'S TAKE: Apple has been a relative laggard as the election of Donald Trump has propelled the Dow Jones Industrial Average ever closer to 20,000 offering. These five stocks are leading the way.

Alphabet rose 0.3% Tuesday to 809.93. The internet giant has formed a flat base with a buy point of 839.10. Alphabet tested its 200-day line a few times in recent weeks, but this month has rebounded off that level and then, on Dec. 9, retook its 50-day moving average on Dec. 9.

Netflix rose 2.2% to close at 128.35, part of a large handle in a cup-base formation going back a year, with a buy point of 129.39.

Netflix had its price target raised last week by Stifel Nicolaus on the strength of its original-content catalog.

Amazon briefly touched its 50-day moving average then pulled back to close at 771.40, up 1.4%.

The holidays were happy ones for Amazon, which says that its very own hardware products, led by the Echo Dot, were its best-selling products.

Facebook rose 0.6% to 118.01, but the stock has been underperforming since late October.

The stock once again failed to recapture its 200-day line, is ending a second month below its 50-day line and has seen its Relative Strength fall sharply.

12/27/2016,0.388026992,0.089622596,790.68,797.86,787.66,791.55,789321,10.2,0.87,1,"Waze, the free mobile navigation application owned by Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), recently announced that they are launching a new initiative, Waze Beacons, deploying Bluetooth beacons inside major tunnels to enable their navigation application to monitor the locations of cars moving inside tunnels.

Bluetooth beacons are one of the technologies used for indoor location positioning, the growing field that includes mobile applications and electronic devices that can measure location in a manner similar to GPS, but indoors, where GPS signals are not available. Indoor location solutions are currently being rolled out in retail stores to help customers find products, in malls to help customers find stores and help friends find each other, in airports to help travelers find their gates, and much more.

The Waze Beacons are the first time that indoor location technology is being used commercially to help automobile navigation in GPS-deprived places. The beacons transmit unique identifying data that the Waze app, running on phones in cars, receives and uses to estimate location. The beacons do not receive any data; all the calculation happens on the phones. The beacon signals can also, in principle, be received and utilized by other apps.

With GPS signals unavailable in tunnels, navigation applications and devices in cars cannot update their location as they move through the tunnels. In tunnels that include exits and turns, such as Boston's Central Artery and Chicago's Lower Loop, the GPS systems will be unable to navigate drivers through the turns. Even in tunnels that just go from point A to point B, such as New York's Lincoln and Holland tunnels, the lack of updated location positioning means that apps cannot warn you about turns you need to make immediately after leaving the tunnel. This is the problem that Waze engineer Gil Disatnik set out to solve. The result was Waze Beacons.

Regular Wi-Fi access points and Bluetooth beacons were not up to the task of moving cars. One challenge related to the speed of moving cars. Bluetooth beacon signals are generally received with a delay of 1-2 seconds, if not more. This may not be a problem while walking around a mall or an airport, but in 2 seconds a car moving at 55 mph (90 kmh) will travel 50 meters, which is 10 meters more than the 40 meter range that most Bluetooth devices deliver. This means that before a smartphone in a car is able to read a Bluetooth signal, it will move out of range and have to start processing the next beacon's signal.

Another set of challenges revolved around mounting beacons on tunnel walls. First, the beacons had to be strong enough not to be damaged by tunnel cleaners or flying objects. Second, concrete tunnel walls reflect Bluetooth signals and de-tune the antenna, sending the signal back to the transmitter and interfering with the signals.

These problems were solved by Waze in partnership with their partner in the project, beacon maker Bluvision (recently acquired by HID Global), which created a customized patch antenna with a large ground plane, which can transmit towards the cars without interference from the tunnel walls.

The Waze team also worked hard on having the beacons be easy to install. Requiring a tunnel to be closed for installation and maintenance would not be effective for rollout. The solution to this problem involved reducing the physical installation time to one minute per beacon. They also reduced configuration time by crowdsourcing configuration through Waze apps driving by.

The resulting system enables Waze to monitor car locations in tunnels to an accuracy of 13 meters, roughly the distance a car travels in half a second at 55 mph. They did this by simplifying the location positioning problem to a one dimensional one. This is certainly accurate enough for Waze to give navigation instructions effectively. The beacons should operate for up to 6 years without maintenance.

Waze is not saying much about their rollout of Waze beacons in tunnels worldwide, but discussions with city governments and other government authorities are underway. Waze is working with governments and other tunnel owners to market the new capabilities. Grizzly Analytics reports almost 200 companies working on technology for location positioning in GPS-less environments, and the Waze beacons are the first to address the practical issues presented by cars driving in tunnels in a practical solution.

What other in-tunnel uses can Waze Beacons have? One likely possibility is self-driving cars, based on Google's or other's R&D, which integrate several technologies for location positioning both on ground and underground. If deployed widely, Waze Beacons could give self-driving cars a strong corroborating source of location data.

What will be next? Now that Waze has beacons that can be effectively installed in tunnels and other underground places, where else can they be installed usefully? Unfortunately, the Waze team isn't talking. But it is easy to see how useful beacons could be in underground parking, underpasses, GPS-challenged areas of big cities, and other areas where GPS signals are not available. In underground parking garages, Waze Beacons could enable car-finding applications, as well as enabling Waze to start routing before reaching the garage exit.

Bluetooth also has an advantage of being much lower power consumption on the phone than GPS. Over time, if beacons are installed in above-ground public areas, the same technology that works inside tunnels can enable Waze (or Google Maps or other apps) to offer location services with less power usage than GPS currently requires.

More esoterically, I believe that Waze beacons are another step in the direction of Google establishing ownership over the complete information chain. Waze is an independent subsidiary of Google, but the ownership is Google's. GPS signals are public, and Waze Beacon signals can be read by anyone, but Waze beacons will give Google ownership of information that will be theirs even as they choose to share.

Google has been very adept at leveraging their control of information all along the chain. It would presumably not be hard for Android to use Waze Beacons to provide location positioning to all Android apps while cars are underground.

Does this effect Google's competition with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)? Apple has purchased several indoor location companies in recent years, two of which gave them technology for self-learning GPS-less location positioning, one based on Bluetooth and one on visual data. But Apple is not competing in the area of navigation applications.

For the public, Waze beacons are going to be great, extending the reach of mapping and navigation applications. Time will tell what other applications Google has for this technology, and what the technology will enable next. Whatever that is, Google will own it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I wouldn't go so far as to say that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has failed in catalyzing the smartwatch market over the past year and a half, but I also wouldn't say that Apple Watch has been a blockbuster success. Sure, Apple Watch is easily the most successful smartwatch to date, but that doesn't actually say a whole lot since it's one of the first wearable devices in the nascent category. There isn't much competition to begin with.

Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) technically beat Apple by a few months, with Android Wear devices becoming available in late 2014. Since then, Apple has taken over and Android Wear has hit a wall. The search giant just re-acqui-hired some smartwatch engineers in preparation of its big 2017 push, as Android Wear 2.0 was recently delayed until next year amid lack of hardware partners. Meanwhile, just days after Google unveiled the Pixel, the first smartphone that it fully designed, rumors surfaced that the search giant was working on its own flagship smartwatches.

It turns out those rumors were at least partially true.

A tale of two flagship smartwatches

In an exclusive interview yesterday with The Verge , Android Wear product manager Jeff Chang confirmed that the company has two flagship smartwatches in the pipeline for the first quarter. The wearable pair will be the first devices to run Android Wear 2.0. Despite the smartwatch market's recent hesitation, Google still wants to show consumers that smartwatches are viable products that can add value to people's lives. Simply put, Google wants to save the smartwatch market.

However, Google isn't designing the smartwatches entirely by itself, nor is it manufacturing them. Instead, Google is taking the same approach that it did with the Nexus phones of yore, where it collaborates with a third-party original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to develop the devices, which will primarily carry that OEM's brand. Chang declined to specify which OEM it is partnering with, beyond noting that it is a current Android Wear partner. That's a sprawling list, but more than likely it'll be one of the familiar Android OEMs like Huawei, Samsung , LG , or Motorola, among a few other candidates. Notably, HTC has not released an Android Wear device ( yet ), so although it is manufacturing the Pixel, we can safely rule out the Taiwanese company.

2017: The year of the smartwatch?

The key to unlocking the smartwatch market's potential will be to empower devices for general purposes. Thus far, manufacturers have focused heavily on fitness functionalities, given wearables' natural applications for tracking activity metrics. Whether or not Android Wear 2.0 can deliver this remains to be seen, although it has potential. The major headliners of the update will be stand-alone apps, additional user customizations, and requisites like messaging and notifications.

While Google can't singlehandedly save the smartwatch market, the subsequent and persistent competition will inevitably improve all products within the category, and that may do the trick.

This podcast was recorded on Dec. 16, 2016.

Dylan Lewis: The quote from John, as we'll refer to him: ""We're in the business of making better drivers. We're a self-driving car company, not a car company."" I think, if you look back at some of the things that have happened in the last month or so, you see that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) seems to be taking kind of a similar route with their autonomous driving ambitions.

Daniel Sparks: Right. We see these big tech companies, and then you look at the giant automobile segments, where companies like Alphabet and Apple don't have any significant revenue, and in theory, it looks like this awesome opportunity for Alphabet and Apple to start making these cars. Maybe that's why a lot of the speculation received so much attention, thinking about a Google-branded or Apple-branded car is a really powerful idea. It could open up the companies to huge new revenue opportunities. But, when you actually get down to think about it, especially in Alphabet's case, it would really be out of their core competency to start making cars. Even Apple, by outsourcing their manufacturing and building Apple-branded hardware products, along with their software, cars is just a whole 'nother breed. It's a really capital-intensive business. By Alphabet doing this -- and now, like we're going to talk about, Apple focusing on the software part of the business -- it really de-risks these new segments. But on the other hand, may decrease some of the potential upside if things do go well.

Lewis: Yeah, you look at the margin profile for the car business and the smartphone business, and they are dramatically different. It would be very tough to achieve high-30% margins in cars. For as much as I know about the industrials business, I know that. So, you can understand why these huge tech companies are instead choosing to focus on something that's super scalable and can be easily brought into millions of cars without actually having to manufacture them themselves.

Meanwhile, just days after Google unveiled the Pixel, the first smartphone that it fully designed, rumors surfaced that the search giant was working on its own flagship smartwatches.

It turns out those rumors were at least partially true.

A tale of two flagship smartwatches

In an exclusive interview yesterday with The Verge, Android Wear product manager Jeff Chang confirmed that the company has two flagship smartwatches in the pipeline for the first quarter. The wearable pair will be the first devices to run Android Wear 2.0. Despite the smartwatch market's recent hesitation, Google still wants to show consumers that smartwatches are viable products that can add value to people's lives. Simply put, Google wants to save the smartwatch market.

However, Google isn't designing the smartwatches entirely by itself, nor is it manufacturing them. Instead, Google is taking the same approach that it did with the Nexus phones of yore, where it collaborates with a third-party original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to develop the devices, which will primarily carry that OEM's brand. Chang declined to specify which OEM it is partnering with, beyond noting that it is a current Android Wear partner. That's a sprawling list, but more than likely it'll be one of the familiar Android OEMs like Huawei, Samsung, LG, or Motorola, among a few other candidates. Notably, HTC has not released an Android Wear device (yet), so although it is manufacturing the Pixel, we can safely rule out the Taiwanese company.

2017: The year of the smartwatch?

The key to unlocking the smartwatch market's potential will be to empower devices for general purposes. Thus far, manufacturers have focused heavily on fitness functionalities, given wearables' natural applications for tracking activity metrics. Whether or not Android Wear 2.0 can deliver this remains to be seen, although it has potential. The major headliners of the update will be stand-alone apps, additional user customizations, and requisites like messaging and notifications.

While Google can't singlehandedly save the smartwatch market, the subsequent and persistent competition will inevitably improve all products within the category, and that may do the trick.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The marketing firm revealed paid search spending from clients saw a 15% year-over-year rise, which marks quite an acceleration from last quarter’s 3.9% year-over-year decline, thanks to 28% in impression growth, 10% in click volume growth, and 5% in CPC growth. Although, the firm notes there also was a 15% dip in click-through-rates.

From Anthony’s standpoint, “The CTR decline was attributed to the jump in impression growth. Mobile was the key driver with spend increasing 69% YoY, desktop increasing 5%, while tablet spend declined 28% YoY (bid modifier effect). The retail and finance verticals were very strong while travel was flat and education spend was down YoY. IgnitionOne is expecting healthy growth in search in 2017.”

Overall, “Both IgnitionOne and RKG reported accelerating growth in search spend in 4Q16, suggesting that Google search growth is very strong this quarter. Add to that, strong growth at YouTube given that app tracking data show a sharp jump in MAUs in 4Q (see our last GOOGL note for details), we see Alphabet reporting strong FX-neutral results,” Anthony concludes.

Following the conference call, the analyst reiterates a Buy rating on GOOGL with a price target of $980, which represents a 21% increase from where the shares last closed.

Victor Anthony has a very good TipRanks score with a 63% success rate and he stands at #78 out of 4,289 analysts. Anthony garners 12.9% in his annual returns. When recommending GOOGL, Anthony earns 8.5% in average profits on the stock.

TipRanks analytics indicate GOOGL as a Strong Buy. Based on 27 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 25 are bullish on Alphabet stock, 1 remains sidelined, and 1 is bearish on the stock. With a return potential of nearly 20%, the stock’s consensus target price stands at $967.50.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GOOGL’s self-driving car project, now known as Waymo, is in discussions to bring a second auto heavy-hitter under its belt.

On Wednesday, Honda made some waves revealing it is in conversation to test Alphabet’s Waymo in assorted cars, exploring use of sensors to computers to software.

This would mark Waymo’s second strategic partnership, as there already is a collaboration in the making with carmaker Fiat Chrysler, widely anticipated to kick-start a ride-hailing service with self-driving cars by the close of 2017.

Just one week prior, after having been in the Google X research lab for eight years, Alphabet’s self-driving car project realized into an independent, separate company, Waymo, with a priority on selling its technology over building cars.

Worthy of note, the Google-parent company plans to keep under wraps the revenue and profitability of its self-driving tech company, with its financial results to be mixed under a branch titled “Other Bets” with the rest of non-Google businesses.

Ruth Porat, GOOGL Chief Financial Officer has advocated for investors to judge Other Bets throughout the course of a “long horizon,” keeping in mind viewing financial results through an “early stage” dose of perspective.

Waymo is adamant in its quest “that there will be more self-driving cars sooner, available from a variety of automakers.” Meanwhile, from Honda’s perspective, “These discussions are an initial step that will allow Waymo and Honda R&D to further explore the potential of a broad range of automated driving technologies.”

Though these discussions are only just the beginning of a potential partnership, clearly both companies are serious enough to make even just initial talks a matter of news-worthy attention. Clearly both Waymo and Honda see it to their favor to make this dialogue public, perhaps to drum up further investor interest.

Brian Fitzgerald of research firm Jefferies for one finds the move encouraging, asserting, “The news supports our expectation that Waymo will be focused on technology with the potential to license to vehicle manufacturers rather than making the cars themselves.”

Moving forward, Waymo outlines the goal that this collaboration ignites future “opportunities to collaborate with Honda to advance fully self-driving technology and make our roads safer,” with hopes to add Honda’s vehicles instilled with GOOGL technology to the existing fleet already under evaluation throughout four U.S. cities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12/22/2016,0.449586311,0.145549492,792.36,793.32,788.58,791.26,972169,4.74,-1.1,0,"For eight years, Google always held its biggest event of the year, its I/O developer conference, in San Francisco.

This year, however, it moved it out (and outdoors) to an amphitheater in Mountain View, right next to its campus. Looking back, that move now feels symbolic. In many ways, 2016 was a year of change for Google: It was the first full year after the surprise Google/Alphabet reorg and the year that saw Google get serious about its own hardware, the cloud and the enterprise. Across the industry, 2016 was also the year of AI and machine learning — and Google was very much at the forefront of this.

Let’s get Google’s misses right out of the way: the launch of its Allo and Duo messaging apps only led to mass confusion and very little adoption; smartwatches are struggling and the fact that Google delayed the launch of Android Wear 2.0 to early next year isn’t helping its wearables strategy; Project Ara, Google’s Lego-like smartphone project, also died a sudden death.

But given the amount of products Google offers, it’s no surprise the company occasionally misses the mark. So let’s get to the good part.

Google used the last year to sharpen its product portfolio and to go after potentially lucrative markets that it previously allowed to linger. Hardware is an obvious example here. After years of working with different hardware manufacturers to produce what were essentially Android reference phones under the Nexus brand, Google ditched that effort this year and launched its Pixel phones under its own name and brand.

That itself would have been a big deal, but Google also launched Google Home (its Amazon Echo challenger), Google Wifi, a new version of the Chromecast dongle and the Daydream VR headset. That’s an unprecedented amount of hardware from Google — and even more so because virtually all of these were developed from the ground up.

If you needed any evidence that Google is serious about making its own hardware, just read over that list again (and you could maybe even add the Pixel C tablet to it, though that launched late in 2015 and has lingered ever since).

At the core of a lot of these products and Google’s overall AI ambitions is the Google Assistant, Google’s effort at building a conversational personal assistant that’ll work across its product line.

The company’s interest in machine learning and AI isn’t new, of course, and the Assistant built on years of developing the Google Knowledge Graph and other projects (which include Google building its own machine learning chips).

But in 2016, Google found a bunch of new surfaces to highlight its AI smarts that actually make sense to consumers. While the Assistant in Google Home wasn’t first to market, I find it to be smarter and more useful than Amazon’s current efforts. And with TensorFlow and other projects, Google has also found a way to seed the developer community with the tools to replicate and improve upon its own work (which will eventually flow back into its own products, too).

As Google competes with Microsoft and others in the productivity space, it has also started to bring some of those AI smarts to its own productivity tools. Those tools previously fell under the Google Apps for Work (or Education) moniker. This year, Google decided that name wasn’t good enough, so it went for “G Suite” instead. I’m not a fan of that name, but that, too, shows how Google is trying to reset expectations.

Indeed, maybe the one area that most clearly shows the changes Google went through last year is its Google Cloud (there’s another new name) division. As Google announced at a small and exclusive event in late September, both the G Suite and all of its products for developers and small businesses now fall under the Google Cloud umbrella. Internally, Google had been using “Google Enterprise” as the name for all of these efforts, but somehow decided that wasn’t the right name, either.

Crunchbase Google Founded 1998 Overview Google is a multinational corporation that is specialized in internet-related services and products.

A lot of that change — and Google’s clearly renewed efforts to finally take the enterprise seriously after letting both its productivity tools and cloud platform linger for a bit as both Amazon and Microsoft made huge strides in the last few years — comes down to Google bringing Diane Greene onboard in 2015. Her arrival signaled that it wasn’t going to cede a lucrative market like that to its competitors.

Google Apps

Over the course of the last year, it finally started opening up more data centers for its Cloud Platform, launched a slew of new cloud products (including a series of machine learning-based services ) to better compete with AWS and Azure, made Firebase its core developer platform , and bought a training company to help enterprises teach their employees how to usethe G Suite apps. It even launched low-code enterprise app development tools. It also made a number of updates to the G Suite apps to help make them more useful for large enterprises.

Most of these are small moves, but taken together, they show Google has hit the reset button on its enterprise efforts and started to go after this market.

The Alphabet/Google reorg probably helped to push some of these changes along, but it also complicates things. Waymo, formerly known as Google’s self-driving car project, is now an Alphabet company, for example. It does seem to have served its purpose in getting Google itself to look at its own projects, though, and search for revenue opportunities beyond the advertising machine that continues to print virtually all of its money.

As for next year? Google I/O will be at Moscone again (according to what I’ve heard), but I don’t think Google is done reinventing itself just yet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12/22/2016,0.448451139,0.140214499,792.36,793.32,788.58,791.26,972169,4.74,-1.1,0,"Honda (NYSE: HMC) said on Wednesday that it is ""entering into formal discussions"" with Waymo, the Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) company formerly known as the Google Self-Driving Car Project, about a tie-up that could put Waymo's technology into some Honda vehicles.

What Honda said about its discussions with Waymo

The two companies are discussing a collaboration similar to the one that Waymo entered into with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE: FCAU) earlier this year (when it was still a Google project.)

Under that deal , Waymo and FCA engineers and technical experts worked together to integrate the Waymo technology into FCA's Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans. One hundred of the Waymo-ized Pacificas will join Waymo's on-road test fleet early next year .

Honda said that its collaboration could ""initially"" provide Waymo with Honda vehicles modified along similar lines. But Honda's statement hints that the collaboration could go beyond that. After noting that Honda is already developing its own self-driving technology, it said the tie-up ""could allow Honda R&D to explore a different technological approach to bring fully self-driving technology to market.""

Why announce discussions when there's no deal yet?

It's a little odd for companies to put out a press release announcing that they're beginning discussions about a collaboration. But Honda did, and the announcement clearly had Waymo's blessing. Why?

I think both companies get some benefit from letting the world know that they're in serious talks about a collaboration.

For Honda, the announcement lets investors and other potential technology partners know that the company is serious about incorporating self-driving technology into its products sooner rather than later. Honda has its own self-driving research project underway, but a collaboration with Waymo could give it a big boost -- albeit at a cost.

All of the established automakers are under considerable pressure to show that they can keep up with potentially disruptive technology companies entering the automotive space. Honda hasn't had much to show recently; this announcement could put it back in the forefront of some tech-minded investors' minds.

It's also possible that the timing of this announcement is related to Honda's product plans. Honda is expected to reveal an all-new version of its Odyssey minivan at the North American International Auto Show (NAIAS) in Detroit in January. Given Waymo's established interest in minivans and apparent intent to start a ride-hailing service, it's very possible that any collaboration will be centered on the new Odyssey.

So why did Waymo play along? Waymo just last week became a separate company under the Alphabet corporate umbrella, and reports have said that it plans to launch a ride-hailing service using semi-autonomous Chrysler minivans late next year. That would be a big step forward for its relationship with FCA, and suggests a deeper tie-up between the two companies, maybe even an exclusive one. (Waymo CEO John Krafcik has made it clear that the company has no intention of building cars on its own.)

I think Waymo might want the world to know that it's not bound to an exclusive relationship with FCA -- or put another way, it's letting other automakers beyond Honda know that it's open for business.

What's next for Honda and Waymo?

That will presumably depend on how these ""formal discussions"" pan out. A statement like this is a strong hint that both companies are inclined to do a deal, but that perhaps the specifics and limitations of the deal are still being debated.

We'll have to wait and see, but it seems more likely than not that Honda will soon be working with Waymo in some capacity. We might learn more next month at NAIAS, where the new Odyssey will be revealed -- and where Waymo's Krafcik is scheduled to make an appearance.

Earlier this year, a consortium of investors led by Baidu CEO Robin Li wanted to buy out the iQiyi business for $2.3 billion, but later dropped the bid after investors claimed that the price was too low. Various market research firms and hedge funds estimate iQiyi's valuation at anywhere between $2.5 billion and $5.5 billion. According to our estimates, the online video division makes up around 5% of our $178 price estimate for Baidu's stock . Our price estimate is roughly 8-10% higher than the current market price, valuing the company at around $62 billion and the iQiyi business at around $3.1 billion.

See our complete analysis for Baidu

Key Metrics For iQiyi

Baidu started its online video business back in 2012 in an attempt to capture the shifting customer demand from television to online video streaming. Baidu's online video business includes its iQiyi video platform, which has an extensive video content library that includes licensed movies, television series, cartoons, variety shows and other programs. In addition to sourcing licensed content, iQiyi also produces a wide array of original content and provides online community services to facilitate user communication and interaction - similar to what Netflix ( NFLX ) does in the U.S. and internationally. We forecast the company's online video services revenues to increase at around 60% annually in 2016 to $1.3 billion - which would be about 11% of Baidu's net revenues - making it the fastest growing revenue stream for Baidu.

Although it is the fastest-growing revenue stream within the company, Baidu has operated its streaming video business at a loss over the past few years. The trend is likely to continue over the next few years until the segment matures. The operating costs for Baidu's online video segment consist primarily of content acquisition costs, bandwidth costs, and other SG&A and marketing expenses. Content costs for iQiyi increased almost tenfold from $140 million in 2013 to to $1.3 billion in 2015. Similarly, both marketing expenses and bandwidth costs increased by over 80% in 2015. In the long run, however, we expect the business to generate positive margins for two primary reasons. Firstly, most of iQiyi's bandwidth costs are fixed in nature, which means that these costs may not recur with revenue gains. Secondly, high content acquisition costs are unlikely to increase at the rate of revenue growth, owing to economies of scale. We currently forecast Baidu's online video segment to report an operating profit starting in 2018.

According to an estimate by iResearch, the online video market in China has grown at a CAGR of over 70% since 2013 to become a RMB 14 billion ($1.8 billion) market by the end of 2015. One of the key factors driving the online video market in China include internet penetration, which has increased from 35% of the population in 2010 to over 50% last year, as well as an increasing mix of high-definition content on the internet. Another primary driver of current and expected growth is the mobile video business, which is being driven by increasing smartphone penetration in China. Factoring in these reasons, iResearch estimates that the online video market in China will grow at 55% this year and at a CAGR of just under 35% from 2016 through 2018 to become a RMB 110 billion market by 2018. In this market space, iQiyi primarily competes with Alibaba's ( BABA ) Youku Tudou, and Tencent's video business, with all three roughly valued at $5-7 billion each.

Baidu's online video revenues grew at over 30% from 2013 through 2015, with its share in the market increasing from under 10% in 2013 to 13.3% in 2015. We forecast Baidu's share in the market to go up to 15% by the end of 2018. Correspondingly, the company's video revenues could continue to grow at around 25% annually over the next few years.

Baidu has not only made large expenditures to acquire premium copyrighted movies and television shows, it has also produced original content exclusive to its platforms and affiliated third party platforms. Earlier this year,Baidu announced that it will invest roughly $1.4 billion to purchase and produce content in the coming year. ((Baidu Plans $1B IPO for Video-Streaming Site, Fox Business, December 2016)) Given the massive amount of investment required to compete with its rivals, it might make sense for the company to spin off the video business in the short term. According to our estimates, the iQiyi business is worth $3.1 billion to Baidu. If the company can raise $1 billion for iQiyi at a valuation of almost $5 billion, it could be a favorable decision for the company. You can modify the interactive charts in the article above to gauge how a change in the online video market and Baidu's market share can have on our price estimate for Baidu.

Based on regulatory filings, the company has saved $3.6 billion in worldwide taxes by making a maneuver known as the “Double Irish With A Dutch Sandwich.” A report in Bloomberg broke down Google’s strategy for decreasing its tax commitments.

The Mountain View company established Google Netherlands B.V, a Dutch subsidiary without employees, back in 2004. The main purpose of this subsidiary is to route Google’s profits to and from its Irish subsidiaries, which are located in a low-tax jurisdiction and are responsible for Google’s IP outside the United States. Money from the Netherlands office is routed to Bermuda, which has zero corporate income tax. Google moved $15.5 billion to this company in 2015. In 2014, that figure was approximately $12 billion. (See also: How Big Corporations Avoid Tax Bills).

According to the Bloomberg report, Google’s effective income tax rate outside the United States was 6.5 percent in 2015 and the company routed $58.3 billion of its profits to the Bermuda tax haven. Google's income tax outside the U.S. was 6 percent in 2014. In a statement, Google said that it complies with tax laws “in every country that we operate.” To be sure, the company’s elaborate ruse to avoid taxes is the result of a prohibitive income tax at home. President-elect Donald Trump has offered a flat taxation rate of 10% to technology companies to make it easier for them to repatriate their profits back home.

In the meanwhile, Google’s tax strategy is sure to draw the attention of EU Commissioner Margarethe Vestager, who hinted earlier this year that the company could be the organization’s next target after Apple Inc. (AAPL). (See also: After Apple, EU Takes Aim At Amazon). According to a study conducted earlier this year, tax evasion by corporate entities cost the EU between $54.5 billion and $76.4 billion. Governments in France and Spain have already conducted raids on Google’s offices. The idea of a “Google Tax” is also spreading across the world. For example, Indonesia has asked the company to pony up back taxes or pay as much as $223 million in fines. India introduced a measure aimed at levying tax on technology behemoths, such as Google and Facebook Inc. (FB), earlier this year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This remains true despite a paltry 4% gain for Google stock in 2016. Investors will forgive a company when its return over five years are over 150%, almost twice the gains of the S&P 500.

Many InvestorPlace writers love GOOGL. Chris Katje thinks its Wing Marketplace, a food delivery start-up, could soon stand on its own. Chris Tyler says you should buy Google stock for a breakout to the upside. Craig Adeyanju insists it leads the self-driving space and is well positioned. Ryan Fuhrmann says the boom story is not over.

But Alphabet is no longer politically favored. CEO Larry Page’s attendance at the Trump “tech summit” continues to anger the company’s allies. Tech companies have reason to fear Trump. GOOGL has $58 billion in cash overseas and the company is not on the President-elect’s Christmas card list.

GOOGL Priced to Perfection

When most smart people are predicting great things, it is always wise to consider a bear case. When everyone is in a stock, or any financial instrument, it makes a fall more likely.

Right now, Alphabet is priced to near-perfection — it has a price-to-earnings multiple of 29 — and it is anticipating a steady rise in profits. That looks baked-in for 2016, with $20.77 per share in net income already booked against last year’s $22.84. The balance sheet looks pristine and cash flow is accelerating, reaching over $26 billion just last quarter.

So far, so good … but Google is changing its alphabet.

The company’s past is based entirely on cloud software delivering advertising revenues. Google has spent 2016 preparing for a big push into hardware, with a new phone to go against the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhone, a voice-activated assistant to go after Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Alexa, a VR headset to go against the Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) Oculus, and a new router that will compete with carrier-delivered gear from Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) and AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T ).

There are two types of risk associated with this move. There is the market risk of going against other big companies. And there is political risk, because every move of the search engine will now be measured against what it means for its growing hardware ecosystem.

There is reason to believe Alphabet knows this. Google Fiber is being scaled back, and the auto business, now called Waymo, is being slowly transformed from a carmaker to a parts-and-software supplier.

Alphabet Can Lose

GOOGL is already facing political headwinds, especially in Europe, which has filed an antitrust case and is demanding global censorship of the internet resource, including erasing statements from people supportive of the new U.S. Administration.

Google was already under pressure on issues of privacy and the so-called “Right to be Forgotten,” designed to make negative statements on people more difficult to trace. Google is still being kept out of China as that country demands the same thing Europe does, obedience to local laws even when they conflict with American norms.

In this clip from the Industry Focus: Tech podcast, Motley Fool analyst Dylan Lewis and contributor Daniel Sparks explain what Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) subsidiary Waymo has said so far in regards to monetizing autonomous cars (and autonomous car technology), and how realistic the company's plans are.

A full transcript follows the video.

This podcast was recorded on Dec. 16, 2016.

Dylan Lewis: One of the other things we got some color on regarding Google's self-driving car project, I guess I should be calling it Waymo now, is exactly how they plan to monetize self-driving car technology. This is something that's been kind of up in the air for a while. At times, they've talked about not wanting to be a car manufacturer, but it's hard to take them at face value there, because they're looking to obscure this as much as possible. You want to talk a little bit about what we got in terms of commentary there?

Daniel Sparks: Yeah, that was one of the big takeaways when they were coming out with this Waymo announcement. There was some speculation that Alphabet could be working on its own Google-branded car. While they might not actually have thought of planning of manufacturing it, as they do with their hardware products, they often outsource the manufacturing and then slap that brand on, similar to the way Apple does with Foxconn, but, there was some speculation that they could try to be working on some Google-branded car, and we have seen their cars with no steering wheel, their ambitious vision of a totally autonomous driving experience. There has been some speculation in the past that they would be planning to bring a larger fleet of those to the market. But the CEO of Waymo, John Krafcik -- I think that's how you pronounce it?

Lewis: I think it's pronounced another way, but I'm not sure. I've only seen it and writing, I have not heard it said. I understand how neither of us are totally sure.

Sparks: OK, that sounds better, we'll go with that. We'll just call him John today. John, he emphasized that they're not trying to turn into a car business, but rather wanting to focus on the technology behind the cars, and basically, Waymo's mission to make driving autonomous, to make it safer, and, as in their name, really focus on the mobility. I think this is a good move. This is something that Alphabet has succeeded at in the past by really focusing on software and gathering data -- because, essentially, that's the company's core mission, to organize data. So, by doing this, I'm actually more bullish on the segment by seeing that they're really going to focus on their core competencies with it. And maybe similar to the way Alphabet tries to add in Google-branded hardware later on with Android, maybe they'll do a similar things with cars by trying to bring in Google-branded cars later on after they've really developed and honed in on their expertise and the autonomous area of the technology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A Google Inc (GOOGL.O) product manager has sued the company, accusing it of unlawfully prohibiting employees from sharing concerns with coworkers, shareholders or the press, and maintaining a ""spying program"" to prevent leaks.

In the class action lawsuit filed on Tuesday in California state court in San Francisco, the employee, identified only as ""John Doe,"" says Google's employment agreements are illegally broad and violate various state labor laws.

The plaintiff says the confidentiality agreements that all Google employees are required to sign essentially bar workers from saying anything about the company, even to each other. The agreements define confidential information as ""without limitation, any information in any form that relates to Google or Google's business that is not generally known,"" according to the lawsuit.

The lawsuit says the agreements violate state laws that provide that employers cannot bar workers from discussing their wages or disclosing information to government agencies.

A spokesperson for Mountain View, California-based Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc, said in a statement that the claims were ""baseless,"" and said the agreements were designed to protect sensitive business information and not to bar employees from discussing working conditions.

""We're very committed to an open internal culture, which means we frequently share with employees details of product launches and confidential business information,"" the spokesperson said.

Google is facing similar claims from an unidentified employee in proceedings before the U.S. National Labor Relations Board, which recently struck down confidentiality agreements and other employment contracts that could discourage workers from discussing concerns at T-Mobile USA Inc, DirectTV and a number of other companies.

In the lawsuit, the plaintiff says that to enforce its policies, Google forces workers to spy on each other through a program called ""Stopleaks"" that requires them to report the disclosure of confidential information. Employees can be fired or sued for violating employment agreements or failing to report leaks, according to the lawsuit.

""Google continues to insist that Googlers refrain from plainly communicating with others that Google is violating the law or endangering consumers,"" the complaint says.

Plaintiffs in court cases are rarely allowed to proceed anonymously absent extraordinary circumstances. The Google worker says that being identified could harm his reputation at the company and his future job prospects.

The plaintiff is seeking to represent all current and former Google employees who signed the agreements. The lawsuit says the company has about 65,000 workers.

12/21/2016,0.51494717,0.187155379,795.84,796.68,787.1,794.56,1211346,9.58,-1.28,0,"Google (or Alphabet, if you prefer) has long been plagued with a problem with its advertising business: while the number of ads people are clicking on has been growing, the value of those ads has been constantly dropping. Google has always excelled at showing the best ads against a search result, but that business may not last forever as the way people interact with technology starts to change rapidly.

That’s all fine as long as Google can keep those clicks growing and coming along, but as we’ve seen in the case of Apple’s smartphone market share topping out, there are only so many eyeballs to get ads in front of people. And for now, it might be able to keep its stock price in a good place. Google has to keep padding those impressions, or get creative around the way it advertises to its users. Wall Street, as usual, is looking for growth — especially in the largest companies in the world. Apple has more or less been punished (or at least, not rewarded) for its slowing smartphone sales and so far lack of dramatic new growth engines.

And that’s just what the company has been doing. This year, Google unveiled two major new hardware products: the Pixel smartphone and the voice-driven living room assistant Google Home (in addition to a few smaller launches like Google Wifi and an updated Chromecast dongle). These more or less fit into the vision of getting people to engage with Google’s search engine in some active way with the hope that if Google figures out how to get it right, it’ll be able to monetize it down the line.

Whether that will convince Wall Street that Google is able to get beyond the search engine by diversifying its touch points — whether that’s voice, phone, VR or any other new interactive medium — is still yet to be seen. Google’s core competency has always been advertising, and while it might be able to build a business on cloud services (as we’ve seen with Amazon is becoming very successful) or new hardware, Google still has so much data that if it can figure out next-generation advertising products on new mediums it might have a new fantastic growth story for Wall Street.

It needed to at least show that intent to Wall Street. A healthy stock price — and also a story about innovation and looking forward — is important to keep attracting the best talent. Google’s problems are some of the hardest in tech, and it needs to be able to tell a story to not only investors but prospective employees that they can work on those hard problems and also be well-compensated for doing so.

Google is trying to flex the power of its machine learning algorithms, which given the data it has may arguably be the most powerful in the world. That helps Google understand complex queries from products like the Google Assistant — and get people to stick to Google’s voice interface versus Apple’s. Amazon exposed latent demand for a voice-driven interface with the Amazon Echo, and Google is essentially hoping to perfect the experience.

As such, while Google has shown that its advertising business isn’t so challenged, it’s showing that it’s already looking toward the future. And that’s been largely reflected in the company’s share price from Wall Street. Despite some bumps in the road, Google at the very least looks on track to hold steady or end the year up a bit from where it was around a year ago today:

All of Google’s efforts to figure out what the next-generation “search” interface will be will have to eventually play out. The way it works is this: Google’s paid clicks are going up, but the cost-per-click — which is the key metric Wall Street is looking at when it’s looking at the health of Google’s business — is still on the decline. That’s because mobile ads are generally less valuable than the company’s desktop search ads.

Here’s a look at the decline, from the company’s last earnings report:

And meanwhile, the paid clicks, also from the last earnings report:

So, if Google’s core business is eventually at risk of a slowdown, or decline, where does it go from here?

Google has shown clear signs that it’s trying to diversify its revenue. Perhaps the largest indicator was the hiring of Diane Green and the ramping up of its cloud services tools in an attempt to challenge Amazon, whose AWS business is rapidly becoming a huge growth engine for Amazon without the excessive costly fiscal baggage of its retail business. Amazon unveiled a huge number of updates to its AWS service earlier this year — including literally driving a truck to your office to put your info into the cloud — and Google is going to be playing catch-up for a while. But, clearly, it’s trying to show Wall Street that it’s more than a search engine.

There’s also its increasing number of updates to its online productivity — which also puts it in competition with Microsoft. It’s also competing with Microsoft through both its cloud services and productivity tools, which Microsoft will never let you forget. And Apple is rapidly trying to ramp up its own services, regularly pointing to the success of things like Apple Music, in order to show Wall Street that it isn’t just a hardware company and can level the playing ground against companies looking to be a combo of hardware and software like Microsoft or google.

And that’s also why there’s a whole section devoted to Google’s “other bets” in its earnings reports, though they haven’t shown themselves to be dramatically successful yet. Google’s core growth engine has been its search ads, but it’s also been known for its “Google X” labs, where it experiments on anything from network fiber to balloons and self-driving cars.

Alphabet — through its CFO Ruth Porat — has been clear that it wants to be more judicious about the way it invests in these other bets. It’s all fine to invest in experimental projects like Fiber and self-driving cars, but if there isn’t a clear path to revenue, the company is going to have to figure out whether or not to move on to the next project and where to devote its resources. Alphabet may be one of the most valuable companies in the world, but even then it still only has so much runway and faces the constant threat from other companies emerging with experimental projects that could be runaway successes (the most obvious threat being the Amazon Echo).

If you wanted any evidence as to how absolutely tiny Google’s bets are for now, here’s a chart for you:

Google saw the demand that Alexa tapped, and it is now looking to essentially smash Alexa — and Siri — with its own assistant powered by machine learning. And there’s a good bet it’ll work. Google has collected data for years and years on how people use the Internet, what kinds of questions they ask a search engine, and where they travel around after those questions have been asked. Google at a very fundamental level has a pretty good understanding of how we tick, and every time you use its services, it gets smarter and smarter. That’s why Google is constantly trying to bury its own interfaces within everything it does.

Sure, Google has a large portfolio of services that it can still throw ads up against. And that, at least for now, is something that can add a lot of value for its investors and keep the ship steady for a while. It has Gmail, with more than a billion users. It has one of the largest browsers in Chrome. In fact, it has a wide portfolio of services with a billion users or more. But those are not Google’s key revenue drivers, and Google has to show that it can keep growing revenue if it’s going to keep Wall Street off its back.

There’s a barrier that Google still has to overcome: while it is constantly learning, refining, improving and helping its users figure out what they are looking for, it also has to do so in a manner that doesn’t seem creepy. Google wants you to be constantly wired to the Internet — whether that’s through your phone, your voice or the way you move throughout the physical world. Google wants to tap your experience through everything from a screen to a virtual reality experience in the case of Daydream. And the company is aggressively spending in order to expand into all of those areas.

Apple still has an ace in the hole. It’s trying to roll out its own wireless earbuds that will give you Siri in your ear and, in theory, because of its proprietary technology it’ll be able to control the entire experience and make it uniquely Apple-y. Like Google, Apple is trying to figure out what kind of user experience looks like beyond the phone. Alexa and Google Home are in the living room, Google Assistant is talking to your phone, but the Airpods and Siri are a sort of wild card that we don’t know how it will play out yet.

In short, Google hasn’t cleared the way and gotten away from its existential crises. As long as those paid clicks keep going up, it’ll be able to keep the runway and hopefully figure out how to apply its strong machine learning capabilities to wherever users are drifting to next. And then once it gets people comfortable talking to, or clicking around, on their controlled user experience it can figure out how to monetize them the way it knows best — through advertisements.

Alphabet’s opportunity is very big. For a moment earlier this year, Alphabet was the most valuable company in the world. In the face of slumping hardware sales, Apple clearly showed the risk that comes with focusing on a business beyond simply hardware, and that for growth it’s important to have a revenue base that exists as a collection of software and hardware. That’s what Google is looking for, with the unifying component being whatever search looks like after people are no longer using a search bar. And it’s a new story for Wall Street that just might work.

The amount the company shifted through its Dutch subsidiary, Google Netherlands Holdings BV, and then on to a Bermuda mailbox was 40 percent greater than in 2014, according to filings the company made with the Dutch Chamber of Commerce on Dec. 12 and which were made available online Tuesday. News of the filings was first reported by the Dutch newspaper Het Financieele Dagblad.

Alphabet moves the bulk of its non-U.S. profits through this Dutch subsidiary, which has no employees. The company has used the Netherlands company since 2004 as part of a tax structure dubbed a "" Double Irish"" and a ""Dutch sandwich."" By moving most of its international profits to Bermuda, the company was able to reduce its effective tax rate outside the U.S. to 6.4 percent in 2015, according to Alphabet’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

“Google complies with the tax laws in every country where we operate,"" a Google spokesman said in a statement. In February, Google also said such calculations of an effective tax rate do not reflect the methods actually used to determine its international taxes in any jurisdiction.

Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.

Some 12 billion euros of the money funneled through the Dutch company in 2015 came from Google Ireland Limited, which collects most of Google’s international advertising revenues. The rest came from a Google subsidiary in Singapore that serves a similar role. The Dutch company then transfers this money on to Google Ireland Holdings Unlimited, which has the right to license Google’s intellectual property outside the U.S. That company is based in Bermuda, which has no corporate income tax. The use of the two Irish entities is what gives the structure its ""Double Irish"" moniker.

The total amount of profit Google had sheltered from U.S. taxation, most of which passes through its Dutch subsidiary en route to Bermuda, grew to $58.3 billion in 2015, according to Alphabet’s SEC filings.

The Irish government closed the tax loophole that permitted ""Double Irish"" tax arrangements in 2015. Companies already using the structure, however, are allowed to continue employing it until the end of 2020.

Google is under pressure from regulators and tax authorities around the world for not paying enough tax. On Tuesday, Indonesia set a Dec. 31 deadline for Google to resolve a tax dispute there, including a possible $223 million fine. The company’s offices in Spain and France have also been raided by tax investigators in the past year.

U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has discussed possible changes to U.S. tax laws in order to allow American companies to repatriate foreign profits at a one-time tax rate of 10 percent. That would eliminate some of the incentive U.S. companies currently have to hold foreign profits outside the U.S. Tech firms have some of the largest such stockpiles, with Apple holding $181 billion outside the U.S. and Microsoft holding $94.4 billion, according to their 2015 annual SEC filings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The analyst initiated coverage on GOOGL with a Buy rating and a price target of $980, which implies a potential upside of just under 20% from where the stock is currently trading.

Anthony believes, “Despite Google continuing to benefit from multiple secular tailwinds and management actively repurchasing shares, investors have been reticent to buy into the stock this year due to tough revenue comps and the prospect of margin pressures at the core Google segment. And recently, the Trump impact and FX have been a concern. We see the stock working through these concerns due to growth opportunities in Search as a result of new and enhanced ad formats and AI, continued strength at YouTube, and growth of enterprise cloud computing. The confluence of these should help offset the tough compares and margin pressures from rising traffic acquisitions costs, hardware sales and growth investments.”

In fact, not only does the analyst dismiss apprehension falling upon Trump and foreign exchange variables and their resultant impact, he sees rapid-fire EPS acceleration bounding from a dip in corporate tax rate as well as a rise in share repurchases, surmising, “if the 60% of Alphabet’s cash domiciled oversees was repatriated and used to aggressively repurchase shares (both subject to several caveats within the Republican tax proposals).”

Victor Anthony has a very good TipRanks score with a 64% success rate and he stands at #67 out of 4,291 analysts. Anthony earns 13.3% in his yearly returns. When recommending GOOGL, Anthony gains 8.7% in average profits on the stock.

TipRanks analytics indicate GOOGL as a Strong Buy. Out of 28 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 26 are bullish on Alphabet stock, 1 remains sidelined, and 1 is bearish on the stock.

The company has spent large amounts of money acquiring companies and investing in new upstarts. Google’s Project Wing, for example, recently announced plans that could soon boost the price of GOOGL stock.

Alphabet announced plans to create an online exchange named “Wing Marketplace” that would allow customers to get deliveries from selected retailers and restaurants.

Drone deliveries aren’t new, but they have not been officially approved in all 50 states. Alphabet is but one of several companies that has tested drone deliveries and showcased its successful launches, but it’s also highlighted possible concerns.

An announcement like this isn’t usually that exciting. However, Alphabet named two companies that are actively looking at using this service, which would give the GOOGL Wing project a huge tailwind. Both Whole Foods Market, Inc. (NASDAQ: WFM ) and Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE: DPZ ) are considering using this service in some capacity.

While they have already declined to sign on due to concerns over the user experience, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX ) also considered the Wing Marketplace as an optional coffee delivery system.

Delivering groceries by drone might need some work (how much weight can a drone carry and how much power will that require?). Delivering items like pizza or fast food, however, are more realistic achievements. For Dominos this represents another technological advancement.

This is a company that caught on to online ordering, mobile ordering and other technology quicker than other pizza companies. Domino’s even played a hand in the world’s first commercial pizza delivery by drone when its New Zealand franchise completed the task earlier this year with drone company Flirtey.

Along with Flirtey, a company backed by Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM ), competition to Google in its drone ambitions comes from Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ). Amazon Prime Air, which successfully delivered a bag of popcorn and Amazon Fire TV Stick to a customer in the United Kingdom earlier this week, leads the way in drone delivery.

As mentioned above, several companies have successfully delivered items by drone in test runs. Project Wing was one of these successful companies earlier this year when it delivered Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE: CMG ) burritos to students at Virginia Tech University. Alphabet has also been a heavy investor in small private companies in the drone sector. From 2012 to 2016, Alphabet trails only Qualcomm for amount invested in the sector for private funding.

Alphabet's early forays into self-driving cars, nanotechnologies, and wearables -- among a host of other futuristic endeavors -- have set it apart.

The notion of IBM as an innovator is more recent, but significant strides in cognitive computing, big data, and cloud analytics has positioned Big Blue on the cutting edge. But the two behemoths are markedly different from an investor's perspective. This makes answering the question of which is the better buy an intriguing one.

The case for Alphabet

Alphabet's stock has performed relatively poorly this year, up just 4.5% despite growing at a phenomenal clip, which is particularly impressive given it's one of the largest companies on the planet. Meanwhile, IBM isn't posting revenue gains quarter in and quarter out, yet its stock has shot up over 21% year to date.

A year ago, Alphabet generated $18.68 billion in total revenue, a 13% improvement over 2014's third quarter. And that paled in comparison to 2016's third quarter, in which revenue climbed 20% year over year, to $22.45 billion. The fact Alphabet is gaining sales momentum at its size is largely due to its focus on mobile search and video, a recognized area of weakness a year ago.

Thanks in part to improving margins, earnings per share soared 27% last quarter despite Alphabet's infamous spending: Both cost of revenue and operating expense increased. However, Alphabet's other revenues skyrocketed 39% in the third quarter, and its ""Other Bets"" losses narrowed. Alphabet's spending is beginning to pay off, which bodes extremely well for continuing its stellar run.

The case for IBM

Investors and pundits seem to realize that for IBM, total revenue takes a backseat to its ""strategic imperatives"" results -- which explains why IBM shareholders are enjoying a banner year. Last quarter's $19.2 billion in sales was flat compared to a year ago, when the company posted a solid result compared with the revenue declines of the past.

IBM's strategic imperatives -- which include data security and mobile sales, in addition to the aforementioned cloud, analytics, and cognitive computing -- generated $8 billion in the quarter, up 16% compared to a year ago. CEO Ginni Rometty's focus on the sales of cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) and business process solutions is driving IBM's strong results.

This year cloud-related SaaS and business process revenue is expected to generate over $80 billion, which explains IBM's phenomenal annual run-rate increase of 66% in the third quarter in what it calls cloud as a service. The annual run rate of $7.5 billion in cloud service sales last quarter was nearly a third of IBM's total strategic imperatives revenue of $31.8 billion.

Surprisingly, IBM actually enjoyed a slight decrease in total expense and other income in the third quarter. The spending decline was surprising in that IBM has invested literally billions of dollars in its strategic imperatives this year alone. And then there's the appeal of IBM's 3.4% dividend yield to investors in search of income. By contrast, Alphabet steadfastly refuses to pay a dividend, though it is giving back to shareholders via its recently announced $7 billion stock repurchase plan.

Which is the better buy?

Alphabet should continue to report quarterly sales and earnings that are simply off the charts, but it's become a victim of its own success. When 20% revenue growth and 27% per-share earnings gains warrant little more than a yawn from investors, it calls into question how much upside Alphabet really offers. That said, its stock should slowly but surely climb over the years, just not as much as it has earned based on its financials.

IBM stock isn't likely to skyrocket any time soon, either. But what IBM stock should do is continue its steady climb, translating to more upside than Alphabet over the long haul -- because of the company's strategic imperatives success, and because it had underperformed for so long. Add in a solid dividend and the nod goes to IBM.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both companies stressed that the talks are about research, rather than full production vehicles, at this point. If all goes well, Honda may provide Waymo with vehicles that are modified to run the self-driving system, and those cars would join the existing Waymo fleet currently being tested in four U.S. cities.

Discussions with Honda underscore that Waymo wants develop the brains behind self-driving vehicle technology rather than build the cars that use it. The talks also show that Waymo, the new name of Google’s Self-Driving Car Project, is eager to work with more car companies as it races to rack up test miles with its autonomous-drive systems and prepare it for commercialization.

“For companies like Apple and Google, it makes more sense to supply the technology than to get into the car business, which is capital intensive and highly regulated,’’ said Michelle Krebs, an analyst at Cox Automotive’s Autotrader.com. “It makes sense for them to provide their technology to companies that are already making cars.’’

Waymo already has a deal with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, which has built 100 Chrysler Pacifica plug-in hybrid minivans equipped with its computers and a suite of sensors, telematics and other systems. FCA’s vehicles will join the company’s fleet of self-driving cars early next year.

General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. tried to strike deals with Google’s self-driving unit last year, but were unable to do so.

Automakers had been wary of working with Google, thinking the internet search giant could dominate their businesses, but that attitude is changing, said Mark Bünger, a vice president covering digital transformation at Lux Research.

Honda shares rose 1.2 percent to 3,570 yen as of the close in Tokyo trading Thursday, compared with a 0.1 percent decline for the Nikkei 225 Stock Average.

First Step

Honda previously announced plans to start selling self-driving cars capable of operating on highways sometime around 2020. That effort will continue, the company said in a statement. But with Waymo’s help, Honda said it could start considering different technical pathways.

“These discussions are an initial step that will allow Waymo and Honda R&D to further explore the potential of a broad range of automated driving technologies,’’ the automaker said in the statement.

Alphabet announced last week that it was separating the car project into a free-standing business called Waymo as it seeks to sharpen its focus on changing the transportation industry.

John Krafcik, who’d previously worked in management at Ford Motor Co. and as chief executive for Hyundai Motor Co.’s U.S. sales unit, is CEO of Waymo.

Frustrating Progress

The Google project lost several top executives this year as some members of the team were frustrated by the pace of progress, especially as traditional automakers and rivals like Uber Technologies Inc. and Tesla Motors Inc. develop their own autonomous-vehicle systems. After revealing the company name last week, Krafcik didn’t offer any details on Waymo’s plans for a viable commercial business.

“It shows a lot of momentum for the self-driving car project, which had seemed to stall just a few months ago,"" Lux’s Bünger said. ""It matters a lot in the sense that there will be more self-driving cars sooner, available from a variety of automakers.”

Waymo said in a statement it’s ""looking forward to exploring opportunities to collaborate with Honda to advance fully self-driving technology and make our roads safer.""

Japan’s third-largest automaker, meanwhile, inherited a legacy of fierce independence from its founder Soichiro Honda, who died in 1991. Wednesday’s announcement reflects the growing credibility of Waymo’s self-driving technologies. It also shows the immense strain automakers face not just in the race toward self-driving, but also in the simultaneous upheavals taking place in ride-sharing and the electrification of the engines to meet emissions limits.

While cautious regarding the need for drivers to maintain responsibility for vehicle operation, Honda has made its semi-autonomous technology package, called Honda Sensing, available on affordable models including its compact Civic. Similar packages of features such as lane-keep assist and adaptive cruise control are typically found on luxury models such as the Volvo XC90, Lexus LS 460 and Mercedes-Benz E-Class.

Partnering with Waymo should help Honda speed development of its own self-driving systems or decide to use what the Google unit has developed.

The suit, filed today in California Superior Court in San Francisco, alleges that Google operates what amounts to an internal “spying program” on its own employees.

Google encourages employees to report one another to superiors

These policies are put in place to allegedly prevent the leaking of potentially damaging information to regulators or law enforcement. They in turn prohibit employees from speaking out about illegal activity within the company, even to its own lawyers, and encourage them to report other employees suspected of leaking information. The Verge has obtained a copy of the complaint, linked below in full.

“Google’s motto is ‘don’t be evil.’ Google’s illegal confidentiality agreements and policies fail this test,” the lawsuit reads. One policy allegedly even prevents employees from writing a novel about working for a large Silicon Valley corporation — like, for instance, Dave Eggers’ dystopian novel, The Circle — without first getting final draft approval from Google. The Information confirmed that this lawsuit was filed by the same individual, known in the suit only as “John Doe,” who filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board earlier this year over many of the same confidentiality policies.

The goal of these confidentiality policies is both to prevent leaking to regulators and law enforcement and to stop employees from handing sensitive information to the press. The suit alleges a Google co-founder — it does not name either Larry Page or Sergey Brin — reiterated at a company all-hands meeting that anyone who leaks confidential info would be terminated.

However, if Google is found guilty of violating California labor law, it could be fined up to $100 for each of the 12 alleged violations, multiplied by its more than 61,000 employees. That fine doubles to $200 per pay period per employee, up to an entire year, if any of the violations persisted past a single pay period. That means the maximum payout here could be as much as $3.8 billion, netting each Google employee around $14,600, The Information estimates. The suit specifically calls out a Securities and Exchange Commission guideline that bans companies from preventing their employees from interacting with the agency about potential violations.

Google won’t let employees write a novel about working in Silicon Valley without final approval

The lawsuit says that Google’s Code of Conduct classifies confidential information as “everything at Google.” It also says the company operates a program called “Stop Leaks” that encourages employees to report suspicious behavior, which includes other employees asking detailed questions about projects or other work details. The suit alleges that Google “suppresses information” about potentially illegally products or regulatory-skirting practices by advising employees not to include emails signaling how the company may have broken the law or violated contract terms.

In a statement obtained by The Verge, a Google spokesperson says the lawsuit is without merit. “We will defend this suit vigorously because it’s baseless. We're very committed to an open internal culture, which means we frequently share with employees details of product launches and confidential business information,” the statement reads. “Transparency is a huge part of our culture. Our employee confidentiality requirements are designed to protect proprietary business information, while not preventing employees from disclosing information about terms and conditions of employment, or workplace concerns.""

(NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL).

Sebastian gleaned new insights into holiday e-commerce trends from the conference call, recognizing these trends point to post-election weakness recovery thanks to robust Cyber-Five growth coupled with mobile traffic. For context, the “Cyber Five” period is the time frame following Thanksgiving through December to-date. Commentary shines the most for Amazon and Facebook, and is “mildly positive” for eBay and Alphabet.

Colin Sebastian has a very good TipRanks score with a 68% success rate and he stands at #37 out of 4,283 analysts. Sebastian garners 14.5% in his annual returns. When recommending AMZN, Sebastian earns 32.8% in average profits on the stock. When suggesting FB, Sebastian realizes 18.4%. When rating EBAY, Sebastian yields 11.6%. When advising GOOGL, Sebastian gains 15.3%.

Let’s dive in:

Amazon’s Competitive Edge Likely to Rise

Amazon appears to be in a “strong” position based upon Sebastian’s conversation with Cobb of eBags. Leading him to reiterate an Outperform rating on shares of AMZN with an $850 price target, which represents a just under 10% increase from current levels.

In fact, the analyst notes that from Cobb’s viewpoint, Amazon rivals its competitor eBay in the spectrum of mobile experience, asserting, “In particular, Mr. Cobb believes that eBay’s mobile experience lags Amazon, as it requires customers to manually sort through a larger number of search results.”

However, Sebastian bears in mind, “As Amazon continues to build out private brands across multiple categories, merchants and brands may become increasingly cautious in selling on the platform. While Amazon continues to generate significant order volumes, we note that sellers may, over time, seek out alternative marketplaces and/or develop and nurture their own online retail sites and apps.”

“In the event of another recession, Amazon will likely see its growth reduced again; however, longer term downturns typically increase Amazon’s competitiveness as weaker competitors may be forced out of business or have less capital flexibility to make long-term investments,” the analyst surmises.

TipRanks analytics exhibit AMZN as a Strong Buy. Out of 34 analysts polled in the last 3 months, 32 are bullish on Amazon while 2 remain sidelined. With a return potential of nearly 23%, the stock’s consensus target price stands at $950.19.

Facebook is a King of Advertising Spend- Thanks to Mobile and Video

Facebook and Alphabet were among two of the shining lights of the conference call, thanks to domination of ad spend on back of driving forces in mobile and video. Accordingly, the analyst reiterates an Outperform rating on FB without listing a price target.

Sebastian accentuates, “Mobile traffic continues to improve and drive an increasing share of visits and engagement, as expected, with merchants allocating larger portions of their advertising budgets to mobile and mobile video despite the lower conversion rates vs. desktop ads. Both executives mentioned video as an increasingly important format to engage with consumers.”

Furthermore, the analyst opines, “With respect to customer acquisition, Google and Facebook are still dominating advertising spend, with mobile video on Facebook emerging this holiday as a new driver of engagement and sales. Separately, eBay CEO Devin Wenig tweeted mobile GMB (gross merchandise bought) share vs. desktop reached 38% on Thanksgiving (up from 35% in 2015), suggesting the growth in mobile traffic has more than offset the related decrease in average order value.”

However, with reigning clout also comes the careful watch of government authorities. “Facebook has achieved overwhelming dominance in the bulk of its key markets and consequently is likely to face increased scrutiny from the DOJ, the EU, and other government watchdogs,” Sebastian concludes, positive on the social media giant, but aware of impending risks.

TipRanks analytics indicate FB as a Strong Buy. Based on 38 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 35 rate a Buy on FB while 3 maintain a Hold. The 12-month average price target stands at $157.71, marking a 32% upside from where the stock is currently trading.

eBay’s Potential Lies in Forthcoming Platform Updates

Whereas Cobbs of eBags sees weakness in eBay, Insley of Quick Ship Brands sees the company as “healthy and improving, and Sebastian tends to agree. The analyst reiterates an Outperform rating on shares of EBAY with a $35 price target, which represents a close to 20% increase from current levels.

Sebastian underscores a general sense of positivity surrounding the platform, as he believes, “Overall, commentary around the planned updates to eBay’s platform seemed optimistic, as merchants and brands anticipate better organic search visibility as a result of improved product/category indexing. In particular, Mr. Cobb believes that eBay’s mobile experience lags Amazon, as it requires customers to manually sort through a larger number of search results. As eBay structured data initiatives progress through 2017, he expects to see better product visibility from both an SEO and on-site search standpoint, giving customers more relevant results and alleviating some of the biggest challenges for marketplace sellers.

“eBay has previously disclosed that the marketplace hosts over a billion live product listings, and many sellers find it difficult to stand out, particularly in crowded product categories. By introducing improved sorting and filtering tools, eBay will seek to streamline the shopping experience for customers while giving sellers greater product exposure,” the analyst contends, anticipating that enhanced customer mobile experience will bode well for the e-commerce and online auction giant.

TipRanks analytics demonstrate EBAY as a Buy. Out of 23 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 9 are bullish on eBay stock, 11 remain sidelined, and 3 are bearish on the stock. With a return potential of nearly 14%, the stock’s consensus target price stands at $33.21.

Alphabet’s Big Threat: Facebook

Google, much like Facebook, has made great strides in mobile and video, with robust growth in Search, a key to winning in both mobile advertising as well as customer acquisition, which are on a surge in expectation of rising volumes.

Therefore, the analyst picks Alphabet as his fourth bullish call, reiterating an Outperform rating on GOOGL without listing a price target.

However, like Facebook, Sebastian is wary that success will bear anti-trust and regulatory-related risks, warning, “As Google’s dominance has grown in Search, the DOJ has increased scrutiny of the company’s activities. This may hamper Google’s competitiveness in the future.”

Moreover, Facebook remains a viable threat to Alphabet, as Sebastian predicts “Facebook may also, over time, compete in search, by using its social network data to augment a search index compiled of public web data.” Additionally, “It is possible that Facebook will launch a third-party Display Network to compete with Google’s network, and thereby take market share,” the analyst adds.

Overall, though Sebastian nonetheless maintains buying opportunity is still compelling for GOOGL, he remains more confident on Facebook in the long-term.

TipRanks analytics show GOOGL as a Strong Buy. Based on 28 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 26 rate a Buy on GOOGL, 1 maintains a Hold, while 1 issues a Sell. The 12-month average price target stands at $968.33, marking a 19% upside from where the stock is currently trading.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has been involved in developing self-driving vehicles since 2009 as part of its [in]famous moonshot projects. The company reported in 2015 that its self-driving cars had logged more than a million driving miles and established an impeccable safety record. But now for the first time, the company has created an independent self-driving car unit and named it Waymo. Waymo will build on self-driving technologies that the company has been developing at its Google X (moonshot) division. Here's why this moonshot could be the next biggest growth driver for Alphabet Inc and GOOGL stock.

Self-Driving Vehicles Could Go Mainstream Sooner Than You Think

Unlike Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) whose self-driving car roadmap is anything but an open book, Alphabet has been quite clear about its autonomous car ambitions. The fact that the company is going all-in into self-driving at a time when Apple has begun scaling down Project Titan signals greater confidence by Alphabet in the autonomous car concept.

Self-driving cars could actually come sooner than many people think. Lack of a proper regulatory framework has been partly to blame for the slow advancement of the self-driving cars concept. Up until recently, a patchwork of regulation in the U.S. and Europe only allowed for testing of self-driving cars in certain states, cities, and towns.

But recent advancements in the industry could push it forward by several years. The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) released new self-driving car regulations in September. Although these are mere guidelines and not rules, they are a clear indication that NHTSA is willing to work with tech to provide tools that make self-driving a reality sooner than the standard 4-8 years that it takes to introduce comprehensive changes.

Also Read: GOOGL Stock: Is Facebook Inc Really A Threat To Alphabet Inc?

Top on NHTSA's guidelines is safety. Companies that manufacture autonomous vehicles will be required to sign a 15-point safety checklist to pre-certify their vehicles. But the safety of self-driving vehicles is not likely to become a major concern. So far, self-driving cars have proven to be considerably safer than human-driven vehicles. The global safety record of human-driven vehicles across all models is one death for every 60 million driving miles. Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) vehicles have logged more than 130 million miles on Autopilot, with only one fatality recorded. Meanwhile, Alphabet's autonomous cars have logged a couple of million miles but with only a dozen or so minor accidents with no serious injuries or fatalities yet. Alphabet's impeccable safety record can partly be chalked up to the fact that it's self-driving cars have a speed limit of 25 miles per hour.

Self-Driving Can Disrupt The Private Automobile Market

Ultimately it's not very likely that the superior safety record of autonomous vehicles is going to change for the worse. As people become increasingly comfortable about hitching a ride in driverless cars, self-driving technology will likely disrupt the private automobile market.

Alphabet will use Waymo to explore opportunities in personal vehicles, public transportation, logistics, and ride sharing. Alphabet is, in fact, one of the foremost companies in the autonomous driving field, and graduation of the project into a targeted revenue generating enterprise is a big positive for Google X and GOOGL stock. But perhaps nowhere is the opportunity for self-driving car greater than in the burgeoning shared mobility market, one that is championed by the likes of Uber and Lyft.

According to Morgan Stanley, cars will drive 19.6 billion miles globally in 2030, almost double the 10.2 billion miles they travelled in 2015. That growth rate is much faster than the estimated production of light vehicles over the same period which will lead to fast growth in the shared mobility industry. Shared cars accounted for just 4% of global miles travelled in 2015, but will account for nearly 30% by 2030.

And, sharing a ride will gradually become cheaper than owning a car. Currently, it costs $0.76/mile for a self-owned car compared to $1.50/mile for a shared ride. But the tables will eventually turn and by 2030 it will cost $0.50/mile for a shared ride compared with $0.75/mile for a private vehicle. Vehicle sharing is seen as the biggest potential market for autonomous vehicles because they remove the human bottlenecks and improve the economics substantially. Morgan Stanley predicts that the shared mobility market will grow to a $2.6-trillion industry by 2030. In a wildly successful scenario, Alphabet might be able to sell as many self-driving cars in 7-8 years as BMW currently does. BMW sold 1.9 million vehicles in 2015. At an ASP of $75k, that would net the company $142.5B, almost triple its current annual revenue. So that's a solid opportunity for Alphabet. Even 20-30% of that would still present a healthy incremental revenue stream for the company.

Investor Takeaway

In the recent past, the future of the autonomous vehicle remained unclear due to lack of a proper regulatory framework that would support mass sales of such vehicles. But with NHTSA starting to move quickly to introduce such regulations, the future of the industry looks bright.

Alphabet is amongst the first companies that are fully dedicated to the self-driving car industry. And now with Waymo the company will be in a better position to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the growing shared mobility market. It will probably take 3-4 years before Alphabet can start selling its autonomous vehicles in large enough volumes. But this is ultimately a long-term catalyst for GOOGL stock.

Love was in the air at President-elect Donald J. Trump’s summit meeting last week with tech executives. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, was really feeling it, coming as it did a day after the company announced that its self-driving technology was ready for commercialization. The meeting was a giant green light for an industry and the multitrillion-dollar investment it will represent, the cost largely to be borne by consumers and government.

Automobile, telecom, tech and e-commerce industries, and their marketers, have spent the last decade enabling the public’s addiction to wired living, working feverishly to bring the phone and the internet into the driving environment. And yet this trend has never been voted on or discussed seriously by our politicians. Even when the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation brought industry leaders to Washington for hearings last spring, congressional interlocutors sought mainly to have their guests tell them how government could help usher in this new age of driverless technology. The assumption was: game on.

In the glorious future, we are assured that driverless cars will save lives, reduce accidents, ease congestion, curb energy consumption and lower harmful emissions. These purported benefits contain elements of truth. But the data is nowhere near complete. Even stipulating that all the claimed benefits will one day materialize, the near- and midterm picture from a public-interest perspective is not the same favorable one that industry sees. Legitimate areas of question and concern remain.

Take, for instance, the “safety” benefits of self-driving cars that include avoiding tens of thousands of highway deaths each year. The truth is, no one knows for sure how many lives could be saved by driverless cars, because data on the role of human error in crashes is incomplete and misleading, relying heavily on self-reporting. The types of accidents we’ll face in this automated future, in which these cars are meant to run together in proximity at high speed, may be fewer, but they’ll be new, different, unpredictable and, on occasion, larger and more grisly than the ones we know today.

SAN FRANCISCO — Facebook, Google and Twitter are being sued by the families of three victims slain in the mass shooting at an Orlando nightclub for allegedly providing ""material support"" to the Islamic State.

The lawsuit, first reported by Fox News, was filed Monday in federal court in the eastern district of Michigan on behalf of the families of Tevin Crosby, Javier Jorge-Reyes and Juan Ramon Guerrero.

The lawsuit is the latest to target popular Internet services for making it too easy for the Islamic State to spread its message. In June, the family of a California college student killed in last year's terrorist attacks in Paris sued Facebook, Google and Twitter. Keith Altman, the attorney representing the three families in the Orlando nightclub lawsuit, also represents the family of that student, Nohemi Gonzalez, in the Paris terrorist attacks lawsuit.

The Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, uses popular Internet services such as Facebook, Twitter and Google's YouTube to spread propaganda, to attract and train new recruits, to celebrate terrorist attacks and publicize executions.

Earlier this month, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter said they would share a database of terror images and videos to more quickly remove terrorism content.

Omar Mateen opened fire inside Orlando's Pulse nightclub in June, killing 49 patrons and injuring 53 others in one of the deadliest shooting sprees in U.S. history. A 29-year-old security guard who pledged his allegiance to ISIS, Mateen was not a member of the terrorist group but had been inspired by it.

""Without Defendants Twitter, Facebook, and Google (YouTube), the explosive growth of ISIS over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible,"" the lawsuit alleges.

In a statement, Facebook said its community standards bar groups from engaging in terrorist activity. ""We take swift action to remove this content when it's reported to us,"" Facebook said. ""We sympathize with the victims and their families.”

Google and Twitter did not respond to requests for comment.

The biggest hurdle the lawsuit faces is a federal law that shields publishers from liability for the speech of others.

Last month Twitter defeated a lawsuit brought by families of two American contractors killed in an attack in Jordan inspired by ISIL, reaffirming social media companies' immunity from liability for user-generated content. The law in question, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, shielded Twitter as a publisher of third-party content.

Altman is attempting a novel legal strategy. In an interview, he said Facebook, Google and Twitter should be held liable for what users post on their services because they pair content with advertising.

""They create unique content by combining ISIS postings with advertisements in a way that is specifically targeted at the viewer,"" the lawsuit alleges. ""Defendants share revenue with ISIS for its content and profit from ISIS postings through advertising revenue.""

Earlier this month, Altman revised his lawsuit on behalf of Gonzalez's family to allege there, too, that the companies created ""original content.""

""Although defendants have not created the posting, nor have they created the advertisement, defendants have created new unique content by choosing which advertisement to combine with the posting,"" the lawsuit contends.

Google Stock Outlook 2017

Markets have been on tenterhooks ever since Google morphed into Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG). Investors were confused about what it meant for GOOG stock, but everything is becoming clear. We can now say why it happened, and what it means for Google stock in 2017.

But before we go further, here’s a taste of what’s in store for the Google stock price in 2017:

A new business segment potentially worth tens of billions of dollars. A new service that could be as popular as “Android.” A new device that could be bigger than the “iPhone.”

Each of the above represents a “trigger point” for Google stock. When a new technology or product reaches its critical mass, the “trigger point” fires, propelling the share price skywards.

You’ll recognize it when you see it. One second there will be calm; the next, every two-bit investor is scrambling to buy the same stock. It’s herd mentality, plain and simple. The market is phenomenal at ignoring emerging technologies until the last possible moment.

But the moment those technologies become undeniable, investors become rabid.

We can lay out a time frame when these events could come to pass, but obviously trying to forecast the exact moment of a trigger point is a fool’s errand. No one has a magic 8-ball.

Anyone who tells you that they know exactly when something will happen is either a liar or a fool.

Steer clear of those charlatans. Think in terms of the next decade. What technologies are going to explode in popularity? Which company is best positioned to exploit that popularity? Once you know the answers to those questions, you can sit back and relax.

The rest happens like clockwork.

Let me give you an example. In the fall of 2015, there was mounting excitement about new technologies like virtual reality (VR) and self-driving cars. A lot of analysts were bullish on the potential of these devices, as they should have been. Both technologies are going to be huge.

But most of them missed a crucial connection. Both driverless cars and VR devices had something in common: they both require advanced graphics cards. Self-driving cars need to understand the world around them, and that requires graphics cards.

Likewise, VR needs to give you the impression of being submerged in a digital world. That also requires excellent graphics cards. We saw that connection. We understood its importance and, more to the point, we understood which company was best positioned to win that industry: NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).

Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com

Since that time, NVDA stock has tripled in value. It shot up 204% in the 12 months since we turned bullish on the graphics card maker. But here’s the best part: both driverless cars and VR haven’t reached their “trigger points” yet; these gains were just the tip of the iceberg.

But what does all this have to do with our Google stock forecast 2017? Let me explain…

#1 “Trigger Point” for Google Stock Outlook 2017

Earlier in this article, I mentioned—or rather hinted at—three trigger points which could send GOOG stock surging in 2017. I also mentioned two questions that needed answering:

What technologies are going to explode in popularity over the next decade? Which company is best positioned to exploit that popularity?

Based on extensive research (and conversations with industry insiders), we have identified three tech trends that are closing in on their “trigger points.”

As for the second question, the answer seems a little obvious. We clearly believe that Google stock will profit from these “trigger points,” or else we would have chosen a different stock to feature in this article.

But now let’s get into the details. The first of our three “trigger points” is an emerging technology trend which has slipped under the radar: Healthcare. I know what you’re thinking—what could a technology company do to impact the healthcare industry?

As it turns out, there’s a lot that a tech company can do for advancing diagnostic treatments. In this case, Google is making use of a company it acquired in 2014. The company, DeepMind Technologies Limited, was focused on “deep learning algorithms” and “neural networks.”

You may know those terms better by their more common name: Artificial Intelligence (AI).

There are a lot of companies hopping on the AI bandwagon, but Google has the cleverest strategy. It has embedded AI software into a range of healthcare apps that will help doctors detect diseases quicker and with greater accuracy. The potential for GOOG stock is amazing.

Imagine if you go in for a routine checkup at your doctor’s office. They do a few scans, the doctor barely glances at them, and then he sends you on your merry way. Fast forward a few years. You’re in for another routine physical, but this time they diagnose you with acute kidney injury.

Even with the best doctors that money can buy, there’s no guarantee that anyone could have predicted your affliction. So it’s not exactly the doctor’s fault. But that doesn’t help your situation.

Google thinks that artificial intelligence (AI)—or “deep learning algorithms,” to be more accurate—can help solve this problem. Its app basically churns through millions of kidney scans. Eventually it begins to understand how the disease evolves, which helps predict diseases earlier on.

Does it sound too good to be true? Well, apparently the National Health Service in the U.K. doesn’t think so. It is already using the app to catch early acute kidney injury. (Source: “NHS to use Google DeepMind AI app to help treat patients,” Engadget, November 22, 2016.)

It was a relatively small piece of news, so it hasn’t seeped into the Google stock price yet. However, the additional revenue from healthcare institutions could send GOOG stock skyrocketing in 2017.

The “trigger point” is all that’s left.

#2 “Trigger Point” for Google Stock Outlook 2017

The second major catalyst for Google stock is self-driving cars. Autonomous vehicles. Driverless tech. Whatever you call it, this trend is fast approaching its “trigger point.” Just look at the search traffic for the keyword “autonomous car”:

Chart courtesy of Google Trends

As you can see, interest in self-driving technology jumped dramatically over the last five years. This isn’t an accident. Companies like Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Uber Technologies, Inc. have made some high-profile investments into driverless technology.

But they weren’t the first. Google was the real pioneer of self-driving technology.

More to the point, Google is in a better position to win than Tesla or Uber. Rather than spending a bunch of cash on building cars. Google is just licensing the tech to existing manufacturers, much like it did with the Android operating system. (Source: “Google and Fiat agree to build a driverless minivan,” The Telegraph, May 3, 2016.)

When the smartphone wars reached their peak, Google didn’t just try to build its own hardware. It developed an open-source platform that other manufacturers could build on top of. It was a brilliant move that paid huge dividends. GOOG stock price has more than doubled since.

Likewise, big automakers—like Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE:FCAU) and Toyota Motor Corp (ADR) (NYSE:TM)—have already agreed to license driverless tech from Google.

Based on the success of Android, Google stock could be in for a huge tailwind once driverless tech has its “trigger point.” That scratches number two off our list, leaving us with one more “trigger point” to explore.

#3 “Trigger Point” for Google Stock Outlook 2017

Virtual reality is the third and final “trigger point” for GOOG stock. The technology is inching its way towards critical mass but, at present, only hardcore gamers and tech junkies have bought a VR system. That could soon change, much to the benefit of Google stock price.

Older and less tech-savvy consumers aren’t familiar with VR. To many of them, it sounds like science fiction. But rest assured that VR devices aren’t a thing of the distant future—they are available through Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and in Best Buy Co Inc (NYSE:BBY) stores around the country.

You can strap on one of these headsets and fall into another world. As someone who owns a VR headset, take it from me: this device is phenomenal. It is like nothing else you have ever experienced, which is why Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS) estimates a potential market size at $80.0 billion.

My only complaint is the limited amount of content.

Think about it: customers aren’t willing to shell out hundreds of dollars for a device when there are only a handful of games or movies to watch. They’d rather wait until more content is developed.

The good news is they won’t have to wait long. Production studios are tripping over each other to establish a foothold in the VR market. All of them know that VR devices could be bigger than the iPhone was in its heyday, so they experimented with new “VR experiences.”

Google is taking full advantage of its monstrous size in the VR world. Its first product was an inexpensive VR headset called “Cardboard.” It was exactly what it sounds like: a cardboard foldout headset that you put together and attach to your smartphone. It cost only $20.00.

Unlike its competitors, Google knew that customers were skittish about VR. So it gave them a low-risk option with “Cardboard.” If customers didn’t take well to VR, big deal. What’s $20.00 in the grand scheme of things? By contrast, competitors were selling VR gear for $600.00 to $1,600.

But excitement for VR is building. The technology is speeding toward its “trigger point” and Google knows it. In response to renewed interest in VR, the company has unveiled the “Daydream,” a high-quality VR viewer.

Granted, at $100.00 per unit, Daydream is more expensive than Cardboard, but customers are more familiar with VR now. They have access to more content and improved quality, so it makes sense for them to shell out the cash.

Moreover, this makes sense from a business standpoint. Google is ramping up its product offerings alongside the VR trend. This way, GOOG stock could be perfectly positioned when VR has its “trigger point.”

In summary: Google stock is on the cusp of extraordinary gains. This stock has already gleaned enormous returns for investors, but VR, autonomous cars, and AI could send GOOG stock soaring in 2017.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By David Nelson, CFA

Once again it's that time of year when financial firms lay out their predictions for the incoming year. I've played the game and while it's fun putting a target on the DOW (NYSEARCA:DIA) or S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY), most will prove wrong when we ring in 2018.

In the days and weeks ahead you're going to hear bullish predictions that seem out of touch with reality to perma-bears predicting a massive correction or bear market. If you keep saying the same thing over and over again, eventually you'll be right.

Let me put that on the back burner for the moment and focus on what professionals are really talking about.

Will it be Macro or Micro events that drive the bulk of 2017 returns?

The above is a conversation taking place at financial institutions around the world. Will it be a geopolitical event or a series of them that drive markets from Risk On to Risk Off and back again? Or, will we finally get back to traditional money management focused on fundamental returns and economic outcomes?

Post the financial crisis, investor performance was largely driven by central bank policy both here and abroad. Fixed income and stocks were in strong bull markets with central bank policies around the world supporting both.

Pay no attention to the man (or woman) behind the curtain





Sure, we had the occasional geopolitical setback with a terrorist attack or currency crisis causing the hiccup. But in the end, it was central bank policy that ruled the day. Post the crisis Bernanke, Yellen, Draghi and Kuroda all took turns playing the Wizard or man behind the curtain. The only thing that mattered was if central banks were accommodative and how much.

Last week's meeting confirmed what we already knew. The Fed, after a long delay has changed course raising the Fed Funds rate for the second time in a decade. We'll have to wait and see if the captain's order came in time but I suspect that the long overdue process of monetary policy handing the baton to fiscal policy has begun.

Of course, the process has started but is no guarantee that fiscal proposals actually become working policy in the months and years ahead.

I'm very encouraged many of the economic proposals discussed by the incoming administration will help drive GDP. However, I've been in this job long enough to understand that there is a huge economic divide between rhetoric and policy. Political compromise has been with us since the dawn of the Republic and I suspect will be a driving force in the years ahead.

Inflection Point

2016 may prove to be an inflection point for markets and maybe for management styles as well. It's pretty clear this was the year that Growth (NYSEARCA:IVW) finally gave up the thrown to Value (NYSEARCA:IVE). For the last several years investors have been crowded into a handful of stocks still exhibiting secular growth and willing to pay almost anything for the privilege. While I believe most of the FANG stocks Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) will perform well, I doubt it will be to the exclusion of all others.

While much has been made of the fact that Value has trounced Growth since Election Day, the peak for this trade really took place at the end of last year.

Another changing dynamic was the rise in rates along with Financials (NYSEARCA:XLF) coming months before the election beginning just after BREXIT in June. The great rotation has likely begun with bond bears like Jeff Gundlach taking a victory lap.

Even with the obvious headwinds for fixed income there are titanic forces in place to prevent a complete collapse of U.S. bonds. On a relative basis, they may not be attractive especially against stocks with dividends close to ten year rates but when compared to international sovereign counterparts, they look like a home run.

Consumer Staples Still at Risk?

The rotation that should continue is out of Consumer Staples (NYSEARCA:XLP) with dividends only somewhat higher than the index while offering little or no organic growth. Coca Cola (NYSE:KO), and many of the food companies fall into that basket. Short of potential M&A activity I find it difficult to make a case for the sector. Shorts, may have as tough time as longs with bankers focused on combining slow growth companies looking for synergies to reduce costs and increase shareholder return. (Expect more mergers in this sector)

While central bank policy may slowly be moving to the sidelines investors still have the inevitable geopolitical challenges to endure. Most will prove transitory creating opportunity but some will force us to change course.

My Prediction

I'm going to approach the challenge this way. Like any pilot, I look at weather reports before stepping into the plane knowing full well that any forecast is no guarantee of clear skies. I may be forced to change course even altering my destination.

Here's my prediction. I'm going to work as hard as I can, as long as I can to get the best investment outcome for investors. I know full well that some of these decisions will be right and some will be wrong.

There's only one thing worse than being wrong, ""It's Staying Wrong!""

Happy Holidays everyone.

Fiat Chrysler, the first major automaker to strike a deal with Alphabet’s Google for autonomous vehicles, has favored cooperating with tech giants to navigate potentially profound changes in the car industry. The company will reveal a fully electric vehicle based on the Chrysler Pacifica at the CES electronics show in Las Vegas next month as it pushes for a role in an industrywide shift toward battery-powered models, people familiar with the matter said last week.

Waymo plans to start a ride-sharing service with Fiat Chrysler’s minivans as part of a reorganization of the tech company’s automotive unit, people familiar with the matter said Dec. 13. Waymo will deploy a semi-autonomous version of the Pacifica for the new service as early as the end of 2017, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the matter is private. Alphabet and Fiat Chrysler declined to comment on their plans.

But while Google expects Waymo to become a revenue source soon, it’s been attacked for seemingly falling behind in the self-driving car race.

Waymo CEO John Krafcik, who by the way is an auto-industry veteran, made it clear that Waymo isn’t a car company.

He said Alphabet’s self-driving car business is into making better drivers. The Wall Street Journal paraphrased Krafcik as saying, “[Krafcik] saw opportunities in ride sharing, transportation logistics and trucking, as well as licensing technology to other auto makers.”

There were no definite statements on how the company intends to generate revenue, either. What is clear is that GOOGL is unlikely to make its own self-driving cars and investors should appreciate Alphabet’s approach. Here’s why.

Google Leads the Self-Driving Car Race

In recent months, Google’s been criticized for slacking off in the self-driving car race. However, its self-driving cars have not logged over 2 million miles over the past eight years for nothing.

Only Tesla Motors Inc’s (NASDAQ: TSLA ) Autopilot program has logged more hours (100 million miles as of May 2016.) That’s because there are around 70,000 autopilot-enabled Tesla cars on the road.

Critics have pointing to moves by traditional automakers like General Motors Company’s (NYSE: GM ) acquisition of Cruise Automation, and Tesla’s Autopilot, among others, as proof that GOOGL is now in the back seat. A report from earlier this year on how Toyota Motor Corp (ADR)(NYSE: TM ) had the highest number of patents related to self-driving cars also helped them buttress their points.

After all, Toyota had over a thousand patents as of when the report was published, while GOOGL only had a few hundred patents. However, what’s not being said is that the patents Alphabet holds are mostly related to Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-Infrastructure (V2I) technologies.

DeepMind, the London-based division of Alphabet Inc. that’s responsible for numerous recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, is hiring its first researcher in the U.S. to boost collaboration across the Atlantic.

Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.

The “applied research scientist position” described in a job posting on DeepMind’s website Thursday will be located at Google’s headquarters in Mountain View, California. It would be the first of “a couple dozen” the company hires, a spokesman said, as DeepMind builds ""a small team"" in the U.S. ""to bridge the gap between Google and our team in London, helping us collaborate even more closely to bring our research breakthroughs to Google users around the world.""

DeepMind has not previously had any researchers based outside of London.

“The Applied team in Mountain View will be made up of a mixture of software engineers and research scientists who work together to solve real-world problems at Google-scale,” according to the job listing.

The new hires will have their own offices at Google’s headquarters. Google’s other artificial intelligence research division, Google Brain, which uses machine learning to improve several Google products, also has offices on that campus. Both vie for the highly competitive field of artificial intelligence experts.

DeepMind is divided into two divisions, one of which does pure computer science research and another, called its applied division, which tries to build real-world products and services based on artificial intelligence. About three-quarters of DeepMind’s staff of 350 work for the research division, while the rest work for the applied unit.

The applied division has partnered with the U.K.’s National Health Service on two pilot projects, including one that uses AI to read eye scans. But its primary customer has been Google itself.

The division used machine learning to figure out how to improve the efficiency of Google’s data centers around the world, resulting in a 40 percent reduction in the amount of energy needed to cool the facilities and a 15 percent improvement in overall power usage efficiency, which measures the power consumed by the data centers’ computers compared with the total energy the facility uses.

DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman, who heads the company’s applied division, has talked about using similar techniques to try to bring efficiency gains to national electricity grids.

The company has said its AI technology has also been incorporated into unspecified improvements in how Google displays advertising and in the shopping experience in the Google Play store, which sells apps for Google’s Android operating system.

In the future, Google may seek to incorporate DeepMind’s recent breakthrough in computer-generated speech, using a technique in which the AI system correctly predicts how to form the next part of a sound wave, to Google products such as its personal digital assistant.

The newly advertised job’s responsibilities include making reinforcement learning --- which uses rewards, such as points in a game, to teach an AI program how to perform a task -- more relevant to solving real-world problems.

DeepMind is perhaps best known for AlphaGo, an AI agent that earlier this year beat one of the world’s reigning champions in the ancient strategy game Go. The victory was considered a major milestone in computer science because Go has too many possible move combinations for a computer to use raw computational power to win. Instead, it must rely on something more akin to human intuition to develop winning strategies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As Waymo becomes part of the Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) family of companies, most analysts are asking when or whether it will contribute to GOOG stock's bottom line.

Source: Brionv via Wikimedia (Modified)

The launch event on Dec. 13 featured a blind man given a ride around Austin, Texas in a car without a steering wheel, and vague discussion of how the project's 2 million miles of self-driving experience could be put to work in ride sharing, trucking or public transport.

While previous GOOG projects like Nest, the automated home company, and Google Fiber, the phone company competitor, quickly floundered as their teams tried to change the world, the car company Waymo seems interested in getting paid for helping others change the world.

It's an important distinction. Google X, the unit into which CFO Ruth Porat put CEO Larry Page's ""moonshots"" in technology unrelated to the search engine, is now expected to turn into a real company or go away.

A Real Market for GOOG

The new Waymo is being run by a car guy, former Hyundai USA President John Krafcik, leaving the experimental team under Chris Urmson by the side of the road. Urmson is launching his own startup.

Krafcik is building a team of experienced auto executives, and representing the company in the press, dealing with the fallout from a Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ) driver dying with the car in a self-driving mode, the opening of a Waymo design office in Detroit and initial questions of government regulation.

These are practical questions previous Alphabet launches tended to ignore. They also tended to ignore whether the opportunity before them was real or in their heads.

In the case of Waymo, it's clear there is a real market. Boston Consulting Group estimates it at $42 billion in software and services within 10 years, others say $560 billion in sales within 20 .

This has attracted real competition, not just from Tesla but from Uber, General Motors Company (NYSE: GM ), Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F ) and start-ups like nuTonomy .

The question for Krafcik is not whether Waymo can knock off these other companies, but where Waymo's experience, software and hardware packages can fit into their plans.

Deliberately Undefined

Krafcik is leaving that deliberately undefined. The company has sold Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE: FCAU ) on a package that will make 100 of its minivans self-driving members of the Waymo fleet.

But there are other assets Krafcik can capitalize on, and technical hurdles to be overcome along the way. The lidar ""bucket"" on top of current Google cars costs too much, for instance. The problems of scaling the solution are real ones. Getting the public, politicians and the insurance industry to accept self-driving as a concept is going to be a huge job for the company.

Waymo needs to bring in enough cash from what it has already done to fund research into these more specialized areas.

For now, Krafcik plans to make Waymo an enabling technology, leaving the heavy capital lifting to others, and making his own efforts self-sustaining.

The Bottom Line on GOOG Stock

This modest approach will free corporate assets to keep investing in software, in cloud data centers, and in device hardware, which is where CFO Ruth Porat wants the company to be.

It should also satisfy shareholders. If Waymo can break even going forward, it will leave GOOG stock's 29.3 price-to-earnings multiple and $554 billion in market cap alone.

Since Porat became CFO for what is now Alphabet in June, 2015, GOOG stock is up 49%, the bottom line growing 20% while the top line has grown 10%; it has kept its operating margins at about 25%, and the company will announce revenues of well over $80 billion for the year when it reports 2016 on Jan. 26.

Steve Jobs had just rejoined the company he had founded two decades earlier: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Two 20-somethings named Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded a company they thought could help organize the world's information: Google -- which later became Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).

The former was worth just over $5 billion, while the latter was worth virtually nothing. Fast-forward not even two decades and they are arguably the two most powerful companies the world has ever known, with a combined market capitalization of almost $1.2 trillion!

But which stock is a better buy at today's prices?

There's no definitive way to answer that question. However, there are many different ways to approach it that will help you get more comfortable picking one of these two titans. Here are the three aspects that I consider to be most important.

Financial fortitude

Too much cash is a good problem to have. Over the long run, owning a company that has this kind of cash ""problem"" is very desirable. That's because when difficult times hit -- and they will hit -- companies that have cash have options. They can outspend their more cash-strapped rivals, buy back their own stock, or even make acquisitions.

Companies that are debt-heavy, on the other hand, find themselves in the exact opposite boat: struggling just to make ends meet, exploring options to be bought out, or even succumbing to bankruptcy.

Here's how Apple and Alphabet stack up in terms of financial fortitude.

Company Cash Debt Net Income Free Cash Flow Alphabet $78 billion $2 billion $19 billion $24 billion Apple $238 billion $75 billion $46 billion $53 billion

It would be very difficult to find two companies that have stronger balance sheets. While it's clear that Apple's numbers are greater than Alphabet's -- even after accounting for the fact that Apple is valued 11% higher than Alphabet -- the point of this lens is to see if one company has substantially more flexibility due to its cash than another.

Once we get to the point that these two companies are at, it's essentially a wash.

Winner: Tie

Sustainable competitive advantages

Of these three factors, this is perhaps the most important. Commonly referred to as a ""moat"" in investing circles, a company's sustainable competitive advantages are often the special sauce that separate it from competitors.

Some might be surprised to hear that I think Alphabet has a much stronger moat than Apple. Apple's moat is two-fold. First, it has a very powerful brand -- even more so abroad. That allows the company to charge more for its products than competitors. Second, the company has been building out an ecosystem that keeps users hooked in the system. For example, if your iPhone is synced with your Mac, your iPad, and your Apple TV, you'd be loath to switch to a different phone.

But the major weakness here is that the company has traditionally relied on coming up with ""the next big thing"" to drive sales. The iPhone was arguably one of the biggest consumer hits ever, but it has been a long time since Apple has released a product that even comes close to touching the iPhone's popularity, and the competition is always clawing for market share.

Alphabet, on the other hand, has the type of moat that famed investor Charlie Munger once said might be the widest he'd ever seen. That's because Google has a dominant search market share globally. But search is just one of seven Alphabet products that have over 1 billion users. The others are: Android, Chrome, Maps, Google Play Store, Gmail, and YouTube.

Think about Alphabet's moat like this: With each additional user that gets in Google's ecosystem, the company collects copious amounts of data, all of which can be used to offer advertising that's more targeted than anywhere in the world. In the end, those ads are what pays the bills at Alphabet, and with the exception of Facebook, there isn't a company (or government) on earth that can come close to Alphabet's data trove.

Winner: Alphabet

Valuation

Finally, we have valuation. This isn't an exact science, but here are four metrics I like to check when evaluating stocks.

Company P/E Ratio P/FCF Ratio PEG Ratio Dividend Alphabet 24 24 1.3 0% Apple 14 12 1.5 2%

While Alphabet appears to be slightly cheaper relative to its growth potential (PEG ratio), Apple is a better deal on every other metric. It's tough to find a company as successful as Apple that's trading for quite so cheap. And the fact that you get a 2% dividend -- which is both safe and has room for growth -- is the icing on the cake that makes Apple the winner of this round.

Winner: Apple

Final call: Draw

Both companies are solid. Apple is the cheaper stock; Alphabet has a stronger moat. As a tie-breaker, I go where my own skin in the game is: I'd definitely side with Alphabet. The company represents 13% of my family's real-life holdings, while Apple clocks in at just under 4%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12/14/2016,0.464107143,0.1025,797.4,804,794.01,797.07,1704150,9.99,-0.33,0,"Yesterday, Google tentatively agreed to a series of changes in the way it collects data from Gmail, as part of a proposed settlement in Northern California District Court. If the court approves the settlement, Google will eliminate any collection of advertising-specific data before an email is accessible in a user’s inbox. The result likely won’t be noticeable to users, but it represents a real change to the way Google’s systems work, brought about after a voluntary settlement rather than a legal ruling.

The case, called Matera vs. Google, began in September 2015, when plaintiffs alleged the email scanning violated California and federal privacy law, calling it “the twenty-first-century equivalent of AT&T eavesdropping on each of its customers’ phone conversations, or of the postal service taking information from private correspondence.”

Google will pay up to $2.2 million in fees

The suit was specifically brought on behalf of non-Gmail users, who haven’t agreed to have their emails scanned under Google’s Terms of Service. Because Gmail’s ad-targeting system draws on every email a Gmail user receives, it inevitably catches some messages from non-Gmail addresses. Scans that take place before emails are available to the user are particularly sensitive, since they’re not yet part of Gmail’s inbox. In real terms, that gap lasts only a few milliseconds, but plaintiffs argued it still constituted a breach of both the federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act and the California Information Privacy Act.

The fix for Google was simple enough: close the gap. Google will still preemptively scan emails for malware and spam filtering, but any advertising-specific scans will be reserved until the email is accessible to the user.

Trump told them his regime is ""going to be here for you. You’ll call my people, you’ll call me. We have no formal chain of command around here.""

Remember now, the invited elites had to literally ascend a golden elevator to arrive at this Trump Tower meeting with America's favorite populist man of the people.

""This is truly an amazing group of people,"" Trump told them. ""I want to add that I’m here to help you folks do well.""

“And you’re doing well right now and I’m very honored by the bounce,” Trump continued.

“They’re all talking about the bounce. So right now everybody in this room has to like me — at least a little bit — but we’re going to try and have that bounce continue.” ""There’s nobody like you in the world. There’s nobody like the people in this room.""

""We’re going to make it a lot easier for you to trade across borders,"" said Trump.

It's not clear what he meant. Maybe the ""bounce"" referred to the chief narcissist's perception of his popularity as unscientifically gauged on the internet.

Shortly after that, the press was ushered out of the room. It wasn’t immediately clear what unfolded after that.

Trump was joined by sons Donald Jr. and Eric, daughter Ivanka, and son-in-law Jared Kushner, as he is at many of the official meetings he has held as Predator-Elect. It's almost like the Trump *family* is running America, which is so weird, because we didn't elect them but here they are, present at every meeting.

Search advertising giant Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has acquired smartwatch platform startup Cronologics for an undisclosed sum, according to a posting.

The acquisition was likely an ""acqui-hire,"" bringing Cronologics' cross-platform operating system knowledge in-house.

Expect some upgrades and input from the new team to show up in the next iteration of Android Wear.

Target Company

San Mateo, California,-based Cronologics was founded in 2014 by CEO Leor Stern, Lan Roche and John Lagerling.

The company's mission was to develop a new, cross-platform smartwatch OS (Operating System) that would integrate with a variety of existing platforms such as Android, Apple iOS (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa system.

To-date, Cronologics had been able to include its Alexa-compatible technology in iMCO Technology's CoWatch, which was called the 'first smartwatch to use Amazon's Alexa voice recognition.""

There were no known external or institutional investors in the company. The founders were all ex-Google business development employees.

Acquisition Terms and Rationale

The two companies did not disclose the consideration for the deal.

It is likely Google paid under $10 million for the acquisition due to its very early stage of development.

According to the team at Cronologics, they saw ""strong alignment with Android Wear's mission...to continue pushing the frontier of wearable technology and smartwatches with Android Wear 2.0 and beyond.""

The deal has the earmarks of a typical ""acqui-hire."" Google likely saw a talented team with some compelling ideas that it could use to move its wearable technology initiatives forward.

Commentary

Google, along with smartwatch makers Apple, Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Fitbit (NYSE:FIT), Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN) and others, has made admirable attempts to develop a smartwatch platform that intrigues consumers.

However, like the others, Google has largely failed to make a system compelling enough to be category-defining.

With the acqui-hire of Cronologics, Google is getting another perspective on the smartwatch segment and bringing cross-platform experience in-house.

I believe the major smartwatch players view the smartwatch as the first interface into wearable computing, and as such, are investing in obtaining market knowledge as they attempt to continue product development, miniaturization and new materials.

Cronologics' competency was in operating systems and interfaces, two important elements in the nascent wearables industry.

Holding a smartphone in your hand is a different proposition than ""wearing"" a device on your body and consumer expectations are still being figured out.

I don't expect major breakthroughs from the acquisition because I believe that wearables will become important when the hardware becomes lighter and form fitting, like Apple's soon-to-ship AirPods.

Rather, expect the next iteration of Android Wear 3.0 to contain some input and technology from the new incoming team as Google makes incremental improvements to the platform's capabilities.

HAVANA Google signed an agreement with the Cuban government on Monday granting internet users on the Communist-run island quicker access to its branded content.

Eric Schmidt, chairman of Google's parent company Alphabet Inc, signed the deal with Mayra Arevich Marin, president of state telecommunications monopoly ETECSA. It grants Cubans speedy access to the Google Global Cache network, which stores content from sites like Gmail and YouTube on servers located closer to end users.

In a country where public internet access is limited to slow and expensive Wi-Fi hot spots, it was not clear how the deal would actually impact service in the short term.

“This deal allows ETECSA to use our technology to reduce latency by caching some of our most popular high bandwidth content like YouTube videos at a local level,"" a Google statement said.

""This may improve reception of cached materials, but not for example email which depends on local bandwidth,” a local telecommunications technician said, requesting anonymity for fear of losing his job.

Google and ETECSA were not immediately available for comment.

President Barack Obama has made improved internet access a central part of his efforts to normalize relations with Cuba, first announced two years ago.

However, Cuba to date has balked at allowing U.S. companies to participate in wiring the country, citing national security concerns.

Whether because of a lack of investment or concerns about the flow of information in a Communist state that monopolizes the media, Cuba has lagged behind in internet usage. Only 5.6 percent of Cuban homes had either intranet or internet access last year, according to a U.N. agency.

The Google deal comes as officials in Havana and Washington are working to wrap up pending commercial accords before President Barack Obama leaves office next month.

President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to scrap detente between the Cold War foes unless Cuba makes political and other concessions.

Improved bilateral relations have been accomplished through executive orders circumventing trade embargo laws and can easily be reversed by Trump.

The Obama administration has said it hopes increased commercial links between the two countries will make it difficult for future administrations to undo the recent warming in U.S.-Cuba relations.

Breaking news holds that Alphabet has spun off its Google self-driving unit into a standalone bet under Alphabet’s umbrella. Google’s self-driving unit is now a standalone firm called Waymo. Don’t take offense with Google’s penchant for poor naming choices, Waymo means “a new Way forward in Mobility.”

The Waymo spinoff suggests that Google is now about to pursue ways to monetize its self-driving tech after spending 7 years in R&D. John Krafcik, who left Hyundai to join Google is the CEO of Waymo. Krafcik is also working with Shaun Stewart who held executive position at TripAdvisor before joining Google.

Waymo is not a car company

Despite the fact that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google was at the forefront of building self-driving cars, Waymo is not setting up shop as a car company. The firm notes that it is looking forward to licensing/selling its self-driving tech to automakers. The firm would also work with players in other industries such as ridesharing, trucking, logistics and public transport where self-driving tech could make a difference.

In Krafcik’s words, “We are a self driving technology company… We’ve been really clear that we’re not a car company although there’s been some confusion on that point. We’re not in the business of making better cars. We’re in the business of making better drivers.”

Waymo’s focus on software is similar to Apple’s recent move to scale down its Apple Car Project Titan to focus on car OS instead of building cars. However, Google and Apple’s move to scale down from hardware and to focus on software might make or mar Tesla Motors Inc Autopilot tech in the grand scheme of things.

To see a list of high yielding CDs go here

Here’s how Waymo might hurt Tesla

Tesla might lose its near-monopoly of Level 5 self-driving tech if Waymo and Apple succeed in the plan to license self-driving tech to carmakers. In fact, Tesla’s Autopilot would be like the iPhone of cars on the one side because Musk controls both the hardware and software of the cars. On the other hand, Waymo will turn out to be the “Android” of self-driving cars because just about every carmaker will build a self-driving car on Waymo in the same way that any tech firm could build a smartphone on Android.

Here’s How Waymo might help Tesla suceed

Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)might succeed by building an exclusive, premium, and elitist self-driving car brand if Waymo licenses its self-driving tech to every carmaker that comes asking. Tesla’s tight control over hardware and software could make its car more appealing to buyers who want privacy and ads-free commute.

If the situation with Android OS on smartphone replays itself with “Waymo OS” for self-driving cars, you should be ready to endure ads on your commute (possibly on the windshield) among other evils that Google is not. More so, each of the carmakers that licenses Waymo’s self-driving tech will personalize the tech to look different from rival offerings. Hence, Waymo-powered self-driving cars are likely to become a confusing bunch in an attempt to be unique.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12/14/2016,0.553180299,0.222675059,797.4,804,794.01,797.07,1704150,9.99,-0.33,0,"Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google self-driving car project is no longer just a project. Starting today, the tech company's self-driving car efforts have graduated from the Google X research unit, as one of Alphabet's ""moonshots,"" to an official Alphabet business called Waymo.

""Waymo stands for a new way forward in mobility. We're a self-driving technology company with a mission to make it safe and easy for people and things to move around,"" Waymo said in a blog post on Tuesday.

Alphabet's launch of Waymo comes nearly eight years after the company began working on self-driving cars, but it enters what is quickly turning into a fiercely competitive market as Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) asserts it is already including self-driving sensors in every vehicle and as other auto manufacturers, tech companies, and ride-hailing services explore ways to monetize the nascent technology.

Meet Waymo

Waymo was careful to emphasize that this is not the beginning of Alphabet's efforts in this important space, but rather the culmination of years of work.

""Waymo may be a new company, but we're building on advanced self-driving technology developed over many years at Google,"" said Waymo chief executive John Krafcik in the company's blog post.

Alphabet knew it was time for Waymo to begin the process of becoming its own company when the former Google X project completed ""the world's first fully self driven car ride"" in late 2015, Krafcik said. Navigating through Austin's suburbs with legally blind passenger Steve Mahan, Alphabet says the drive reflected everyday driving situations.

Mahan explained the importance of this milestone:

The ability to complete a fully self-driven trip on everyday public roads, with no test driver, was a big milestone for our team and the history of this technology. It was the signal that we could begin to shift our focus from foundational technical work toward launching our own company so we can offer many more rides, in more places, for more people.

Self-driving technology -- not self-driving cars

Interestingly, in conjunction with the announcement of Waymo today, Alphabet is reportedly backing off any plans to manufacture and sell its own self-driving cars, opting instead to partner with auto manufacturers in order to deploy the technology, according to The Information's Amir Efrati.

Alphabet has backed off plans to develop a revolutionary car without a steering wheel or pedals, at least for now, according to people close to the closely watched project. Instead, the self-driving car pioneer has settled on a more practical effort to partner with automakers to make a vehicle that drives itself but has traditional features for human drivers.

And a comment from Waymo's Krafcik during a press conference on Tuesday seems to confirm the new company's choice to abstain from auto manufacturing for now. ""We've been really clear that we're not a car company,"" Krafcik said (via The New York Times). ""We're not in the business of making better cars. We're in the business of making better drivers.""

Alphabet's decision to refrain from manufacturing its own self-driving vehicles differs from Tesla's emphasis on both the self-driving technology and the manufacturing of self-driving vehicles and it means Tesla doesn't have to worry about the technology giant becoming a direct competitor -- for now. However, it's worth noting it was never certain Alphabet ever intended on manufacturing its own vehicles in the first place.

Given how competitive and capital intensive the auto market is, focusing solely on the self-driving technology may arguably be the better move for software-centric Alphabet's Waymo. Indeed, Waymo isn't the only major company to acknowledge the challenge ambitious manufacturing plans could bring about. By focusing on the autonomous driving software instead of building self-driving cars, Alphabet's Waymo vision mimics a recent report that Apple has also shifted its focus from building its own self-driving car to emphasizing the development of the underlying technology for autonomous driving.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Size hasn’t stopped Alphabet from growing in double digits .

. What is the real potential impact of Facebook’s growth on Google ad revenues?

Can Google fend them off, and how can you benefit from this duel?

Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock price has been nearly flat in the last twelve months despite the company posting average YoY revenue growth of 19.65% in the last three quarters. The double digit growth rate is staggering because Alphabet’s quarterly revenues are already well over $20 billion. What’s even more surprising though, is the meek response from the market, which decided to completely overlook the strong growth numbers. Now with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) doing a stellar job both financially, and in terms of stock performance, comparisons are being drawn again. Can Facebook really dent Alphabet Inc?

A Valuation Problem?

One of the major factors that resulted in the market’s muted reaction is Alphabet’s current valuation. The stock is already trading above 6 times sales and 28 times earnings, which is a bit on the high side for a technology company of Alphabet’s size and scale. A lot of that double-digit growth seems to have been already priced in and, as a result, the stock kept moving sideways.

The other factor that is also playing an important role is the growth expectation. The online advertising industry still has plenty of room to grow, but a large portion of that growth will come from developing markets that are comparatively less profitable than developed markets, and also due to the shift from desktop to mobile.

The impact of that shift can already be seen in the way Alphabet’s aggregate cost per click has declined in the last two years. At the same time, the total number of clicks has increased. The shift to mobile as well as the increasing traffic from new markets are jointly giving more click volume, but lower revenue per click. This trend will continue, it is not something that Alphabet can snap itself out of that easily; and in all likelihood we might see this accelerate in the next few years as mobile usage in developing markets increases. (See Also: FB Stock: Is Facebook Inc (FB) Eating YouTube's Lunch- Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) ?)

Margins Gaining Stability, and No Competitor Breathing Down its Neck

Google’s operating margin has been coming down as result of these changes but, thankfully, the numbers are a tad more stable this year. The decline in operating margins was not because Alphabet had to cut down its pricing because of competition, but more because of the shift in market dynamics we discussed above.

Despite the decline, however, Alphabet’s advertising machine remains a cash cow for the company and will remain that way for many more years to come, as there is no clear rival that can give an advertiser more leverage for its ad dollars.

Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) might have overtaken Alphabet in the news traffic referral race, but the company is still many years away from the market leader in terms of revenues. Traffic referral is basically the volume of web visits that go to a website after users have clicked a link. With Google, it’s about clicks on search results, news links and so on; with Facebook, it’s about clicks to advertised or organic linked posts.

The Facebook threat is certainly there for Alphabet, but there’s plenty of time before the social media giant can mount a full-scale attack on Google revenue streams. Again, with the shift to mobile, Facebook benefits from increased traffic and ad revenues, but it’s far behind in the video space, which YouTube will continue to dominate for the foreseeable future.

“YouTube revenue continues to grow at a very significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView, with a growing contribution from buying on DoubleClick Bid Manager.” - Sundar Pichai, CEO, Google

Table for Two, Please!

That balance will keep Facebook at bay for now, but there’s also another factor to consider. The online advertising market might be growing at a rapid pace, but has yet to ‘come of age’, as it were. Print advertising may have taken a hit in the last five years, but television still holds the lion’s share of ad revenues globally.

Source: Intelliassist

That means the growth opportunity isn’t only there for newer players like Facebook; it is very much there for Alphabet as well, as they’ve shown over recent quarters.

Therefore, it stands to reason that even if Facebook is able to show rapid growth - and they’ve already warned of reaching optimal ad loads - over the next few quarters, all Alphabet needs to do is keep their own double digit growth intact for them to fend off Facebook.

In Summary

Put all these factors together and it’s clear that the runway is long for Alphabet’s Google. Notwithstanding the fact that Other Bets have largely shown disappointing results until now, the ad engine is sufficiently primed to sustain whatever growth levels Google is experiencing at this point.

For an investor, the only cause for worry will be the valuation of 6+ times sales. Your returns may take a while to come, so do give yourself some margin for error. The best way is to build your position over a period of time, especially during dips. That way, you get to keep your cost basis down as much as possible, yet accrue value to your portfolio over time.

The eight letters published today were sent to Google from FBI offices across the country. Cumulatively, the NSLs seek broad access to content for around 20 user accounts. The usernames of the targets are redacted, although the FBI does not require it. A Google spokesperson said the usernames were redacted to protect user privacy and that the targeted individuals had been notified.

The NSLs were sent to Google over a five-year period, from 2010 to 2015, with the majority coming from the Charlotte, North Carolina field office of the FBI. Others came from Florida, Arizona, New York and California.

NSLs have historically been issued with interminable gag orders preventing tech companies from discussing the letters or their contents, but the passage of the USA Freedom Act last year allowed companies to begin disclosing the letters. Yahoo became the first major tech company to disclose NSLs it received from the FBI, publishing three in June. Since then, Google and the Internet Archive have followed suit.

“In our continued effort to increase transparency around government demands for user data, today we begin to make available to the public the National Security Letters (NSLs) we have received where, either through litigation or legislation, we have been freed of nondisclosure obligations,” Richard Salgado, Google’s director of law enforcement and information security, wrote in a blog post.

Google has fought to make the letters public in part because the FBI can issue them without prior judicial oversight. Many tech companies have argued that, given the wealth of information held in their users’ accounts, the data should not be subject to a secret search without the approval of a court. Over the past several years, Google challenged 19 NSLs in court and last year won the right to tell WikiLeaks employees that their data had been requested.

Soon, Google will establish a home for its NSL disclosures as part of its transparency report, Salgado said. In the meantime, you can read the eight letters here

SAN FRANCISCO — By renaming itself Waymo, Google's self-driving car project officially changes lanes from research project to business enterprise that, at some point soon, will have to turn a profit.

""We'll continue to have access of infrastructure and resources Alphabet provides, but we also have this feeling of being a venture-backed startup,"" said John Krafcik, formerly CEO of Google Cars and now leader of Waymo, said at an event here Tuesday.

Krafcik said ""we are all in on fully driverless solutions, that's what we're all about."" He added that driver assist technologies, which often ask humans to take back control of the car, don't interest Waymo. But the car might still have steering wheels and pedals, even if the vehicle is fully capable of driving itself.

There were no details provided on Waymo's business plan, although the mission is to bring the company's technology to market and monetize it via a partnership with an automotive company.

Google has been working on self-driving cars for the past eight years. The team was under the Google X ""moonshot"" division, and largely was a research and development effort. But as more technology companies and automakers moved have stepped up their self-driving car efforts over the past year, the pressure grew for Google to steer its autonomous project toward becoming a commercial enterprise.

Last spring, Google inked a deal with Fiat Chrysler to outfit 100 Pacifica minivans with Google's radar, lasers and cameras. Google had said the deal was made to quickly add to its fleet in order to further test its systems and ready them for commercial use.

""We're in the build phase right now, so the next generation of our sensors will go into those Pacificas and they'll be on the road in the very near future,"" said Krafcik.

Michelle Krebs, senior analyst for Autotrader, said Waymo's reiterating that it plans to be a tech supplier could help accelerate a self-driving future.

“Google focusing on the software and the technology for self-driving vehicles make more sense, since that is its expertise, than trying to be a full-fledged automaker,"" said Krebs. ""By supplying its technology to others, Google has the opportunity to proliferate self-driving vehicles in a way many others cannot.”

""I'm a legally blind American, and there are millions of people like me,"" said Steve Mahan, the man who has helped Google test its driverless technology over the past years. ""I dreamed of being an astronaut as a kid. I had no idea that by 50 I'd be blind, and even the standard family car would no longer be available to me.""

Mahan said that being part of the Google car testing program has made him feel ""very empowered, in five minutes you're perfectly at home inside them.""

Dmitri Dolgov, the head of Waymo's self driving technology, said that the most difficult aspects of developing a commercial self-driving vehicle is anticipating the unexpected.

Per The Wall Street Journal, the small selective group is expected to include top-executives from Apple Inc. ( AAPL ), Alphabet Inc ( GOOGL ), Amazon.com, Inc. ( AMZN ), Cisco Systems, Inc. ( CSCO ), Facebook Inc ( FB ), International Business Machines Corp. ( IBM ), Intel Corporation ( INTC ), Microsoft Corporation ( MSFT ) and Oracle Corporation ( ORCL ), along with Tesla Motors Inc’s ( TSLA ) Elon Musk.

The event is significant for the technology and allied sector as it grapples with growing uncertainty over Trump administration’s economic policies and its impact on the industry.

Notably, top-most technology leaders of the Silicon Valley had openly protested against Trump’s rhetoric during election campaign. The President-elect had threatened to force technology companies like Apple to bring their overseas manufacturing operations back to the U.S.

Moreover, Trump’s views over antitrust enforcement, trade protectionism, immigration policy (particularly issuance of H1B visas used to hire skilled foreigners) and net-neutrality (Donald Trump is known as a criticizer of this policy) are some of the major headwinds for the U.S. technology companies like IBM, Alphabet and Netflix, Inc. ( NFLX ).

Another concern is Trump’s determination to cut clean energy spending.

Most of the big technology companies have been moving toward clean energy with the help of government tax breaks. Any spending cut will certainly be a dampener on these plans.

Technology Sector and Donald Trump – Common Ground

Despite the verbal volleys and pre-election enmity, it is now quite clear that none of them — Donald Trump nor the Silicon Valley bigwigs — can ignore each other. For the sake of smooth running of their businesses as well as the U.S. economy, a “common ground” is necessary as observed by the Cowen & Co. analyst Paul Gallant.

Corporate tax reform that has been blatantly advocated by the President-elect since early days of his campaign is an issue that can bring technology leaders and Donald Trump to a truce.

Per data from Moody’s Investors Service Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Cisco and Oracle together made up almost 30% ($504 billion) of the $1.7 trillion in cash and cash equivalents held by U.S. non-financial companies in 2015. According to figures from the WSJ: “Apple alone holds about 91% of its $237.6 billion in cash offshore.”

Notably, the U.S. government currently levies a 35% tax rate on repatriated cash, which Trump has promised to lower to 15%. An ideal restructuring of tax rates will enable companies like Apple to bring back a major part of their offshore cash to the U.S.

Will Technology Stocks Rebound?

Since Donald Trump’s selection (Nov 9), we note that the Zacks Computer & Technology industry has returned a modest 2.12% as compared with S&P 500 Composite’s gain of 4.22%. However, we believe that the upcoming meet will ease out some of those concerns that will eventually help the stocks to rebound.

We use our VGM Score to track technology stocks that shows characteristics to outperform the broader market. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of ‘A’ or ‘B’ when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) offer the best upside potential.

Here we pick four stocks that have a favorable combination of VGM score of ‘A’ and Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

This is according to a Japanese blog which has a decent record in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) scoops. The iPhone 8 is expected to be launched next year around September when Apple traditionally launches new products. The new iPhone color would be an addition to the ones that already exist including silver, black, gold, jet black and rose gold. Besides the new bold color, the Japanese blog also added that the new iPhone would sport a new processor, the A11 chip.

Information That the IPhone 8 Could Be Red Leaked by Supplier

The Japanese blog indicated that its source of information was a supplier based in Taiwan. The blog went on to say that the next iPhone was not the iPhone 8 but iterations of iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 7. Rival Apple news sites added to the confusion by saying there would be three iPhones released in the coming year. This would be the iPhone 7, the iPhone 7 Plus and the iPhone 8.

Rumors on how the next iPhone will look like have been increasing by the day as the iconic smartphone nears its tenth year of existence. Among the unconfirmed rumors, besides that the iPhone 8 could be red in color, is the fact that the iPhone 8 would no longer be having the Home button but the functionality would instead be placed at the rear of the phone or under the screen. Equally, it has also been rumored that the display area in the new iPhone would cover the entire front of the phone.

Curved Display

There have also been other rumors suggesting that the next iPhone, or at least one of the versions, would have an OLED display. Other features that have been speculated about include capabilities for wireless charging.

Adding strength to the rumors is the fact that for a long time now, Apple has been relying on incremental changes to the iPhone and it now needs to do something revolutionary in order to enjoy sales figures that would rival those of the first few generations of the iPhone. this will require doing more than offering more colors, like the rumors that the iPhone 8 could be red suggest.

Apple may lose the 'most valuable company' tag to Alphabet .

. What are the next steps for Apple to reclaim the throne?

What is the viability factor for future iPhones?

There is plenty of reason to believe that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) might lose its No. 1 market cap status to second-placed Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Apple’s market cap at the time of writing the article is $614.01 billion, while Alphabet is at $559.77 billion.

In the last twelve months, AAPL stock is only marginally up by 0.11% whereas GOOGL stock is up by 7.66%. The problem is that Apple’s revenue in 2016 declined by 8%, while Alphabet’s revenue in the first three-quarters of the year increased by 19.65%.There’s a valid reason why the positional switchover might happen. Let's take a closer look.

Market Segments and Valuations

The problem for Apple was that the bulk of their revenue, 63.4%, came from iPhone sales. With smartphone sales growth showing signs of plateauing around the world, the odds of iPhone sales picking up pace over the next few years is quite slim. Compare that to Alphabet’s continued double-digit growth and the fact that online advertising has plenty of room to grow in the future, the difference in the fortunes of both the companies is quite stark.

At this point, one might argue that the valuations of both these companies have already priced in these growth factors, as Alphabet is trading at 29 times its earnings, while Apple is trading less than half of that valuation, at 13.69 times. Clearly, Apple’s valuation looks extremely depressed compared to Alphabet’s, but so do the fortunes of the respective segments they compete in. The market can remain irrational much longer than we can remain solvent, and there is no guarantee that the situation will reverse soon.

Apple’s depressed valuation makes it a great buy at this price point, and the biggest factor that an investor needs to consider is the slowdown in smartphone sales. Though it might sound preposterous, the lack of growth opportunity in smartphone sales around the world is possibly the best thing that happened to Apple and its investors. This has already pushed Apple into a corner, and with smartphone penetration in developed markets at record levels, there are very few new hands left for the company to push their iPhone into. (See Also: AAPL Stock: Apple Inc. Hints At Its Next Disruptive Product )

What Next for Apple?

As a result, Apple has certain options in front of it. The company can now shift its focus to emerging markets, where smartphone penetration is still low. Though the return might be a lot lower than what you normally see in developed markets, this will at least provide some room for growth, albeit at a lower margin level. Apple has already started pushing its low cost model iPhone SE to address this market segment, and it will continue its push in that direction.

Though analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has indicated that there’s no iPhone SE refresh coming in March 2017, there’s no reason for Apple to discontinue the model. His argument is that Apple wants to maximise margins and prevent the SE from cannibalising potential iPhone 7 sales, but markets like China and India will still have room for SE sales through next year, which Apple can’t afford to let go of.

Now that it is acutely aware of the state of the market in developed countries, the company has no choice but to accelerate its innovation process to make its newer models irresistible to buyers in the United States and other developed markets.

In addition, the company may want to make refresh cycles as short as possible, with the possible exception of iPhone SE for early next year. And the only way to do that is by producing better phones than ever before, which will push the company to its limits when it comes to innovation. No more incremental innovations like iPhone 7 vs iPhone 6S, because it is just not going to cut it any more. And we’re not just talking about next year’s iPhone, dubbed iPhone 8. The company must think beyond its 10th anniversary edition of the iconic smartphone.

Beyond iPhone

Furthermore, as the company fights for its smartphone sales numbers, it also will scramble to build its alternate revenue streams that run through its services portfolio.

Case in point is the way Apple started focusing on Apple Pay’s rollout. After the launch in October 2014, Apple Pay was available in United States and United Kingdom by the end of 2014, and then added Canada and Australia in 2015.

But in 2016 when the smartphone sales slowdown shocked the company, Apple Pay was rolled out in China, Singapore, Switzerland, France, Hong Kong, Russia, New Zealand, Japan and Spain. That’s nearly nine countries in twelve months, and it's clear that a lot more will be added in the next twelve months.

Apple’s services revenue was the only bright spot in the company’s financial reports last fiscal, growing by 22% from $19.909 billion last year to $24.348 billion. It still accounts for little more than ten percent of their overall revenues, but a proper ecosystem that can add value to its loyal customers will go a long way in keeping those customers inside Apple’s world, eventually making sure that the company’s moat is as good as it can be.

The Edge Remains

Now throw in the fact that Apple captured nearly 91% of the smartphone industry’s profits in 2015, it’s amply clear that a lot of companies that are selling smartphones today won't be around five years from now.

Apple has a cash generating machine in the iPhone, and the innovation and applications that it brings to the table will be unbeatable in the market, creating a huge lead for the company over time. If such a company is selling at 13 times earnings, the best play would be to add them to your portfolio because the market hasn’t valued these strengths into its current pricing, which seems to reflect the current revenue growth rate and not the inherent strength of the company that will serve them well over the years.

Alphabet shares were up just 1.7% year-to-date through Dec. 8. “Imagine that,” my mother-in-law would say in her best Maritime accent.

However, if you’ve never owned GOOGL stock, don’t be put off by its lack of performance in 2016. It’s a must-own stock for any investment portfolio.

Here are three reasons why I feel this way.

GOOGL Stock Key #1: “Other Revenues”

You might think that Google is nothing more than a glorified advertising company — after all, 89% of the $76.1 billion in annual revenue Alphabet generated through the end of September came from its ad business — but you’d be mistaken.

In Q3 2016, GOOGL generated $2.4 billion in other revenues, 39% higher year-over-year and 12% sequentially. This represented 10.9% of the Google segment’s overall revenue of $22.3 billion. For the first nine months of the year, Google’s other revenues came to $6.7 billion, 31% higher than a year earlier. There’s nothing insignificant about this kind of revenue. On its own, it would be a decent-sized business.

The two biggest components of its other revenues: Google Cloud and Google Play.

While the advertising revenue generated by Google Play is included in the websites sub-segment of Google, the apps and media content sold in the Google Play store falls under other revenues. With the global mobile app market expected to surpass $100 billion by 2020, Google’s revenues in this area will jump exponentially.

On the cloud side of the ledger, GOOGL has been playing a weak game of catch-up with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), but the Q3 numbers suggest that’s starting to change for the better.

Keep an eye on this number. As long as other revenues continue to grow as a percentage of Google’s overall revenue, Alphabet’s winning.

GOOGL Stock Key #2: “Other Bets”

The “Other Bets” — not to be confused with “other revenues” — are the various businesses Alphabet owns outside its legacy Google segment. They include Nest, Verily, Access, X, etc. and represent the company’s constant push for innovation.

They’re also big-time money losers.

In the 12 months ended Sept. 30, they collectively lost $3.8 billion. Most of the early stage revenue is generated by Nest (thermostats, CO2 sensors), Access (Google Fiber) and Verily (contact lenses, healthcare analytics).

In the first nine months of 2016, its Other Bets saw revenues increase 85% year-over-year to $595 million, but still less than 1% of the legacy business’s overall revenue.

Innovation, while at the heart of the Other Bets’ DNA, can’t be carried out in a bubble. Profits do matter. When Alphabet was created, entrepreneurial leaders such as former Nest CEO and co-founder Tony Fadell felt hamstrung by a new financial discipline that asked more of its so-called “moonshots.” He left in June.

While that’s temporarily slowed innovation at Nest, ultimately it looks to be the first Other Bets business to actually make money.

Google’s antitrust battle with the European Union seems to be heating up. In recent weeks, the company has rebutted the European Commission’s charges that it uses its internet search engine to give its shopping services an unfair advantage over rivals, improperly uses its AdSense ad-placement service to restrict third-party websites from displaying search advertisements from Google’s competitors, and unfairly exploits the dominant position of its Android operating system with smartphone manufacturers and mobile network operators (see its November 3 and November 10 blog posts.)

We think Google’s rebuttal of the charges against its shopping and ad-placement services are effective, and it has even made some changes to its products to address issues raised by the European Union. But we think it is unlikely that Google will be able to prevail in the Android case unless it abandons its contention that E.U. authorities should adopt a U.S. perspective. Instead, it should try to persuade them that competition in the mobile space is radically different from that in traditional markets and consequently, the European Union — and the United States, for that matter — should revamp their antitrust laws.

Companies like Google operate simultaneously in multiple ecosystems, as do their competitors. As such, any analysis of competitive dynamics must be done across ecosystems — something the European Union hasn’t done. Instead, it has just focused on the mobile-operating-system market. Given that Google has a European market share of more than 90% in general internet search services, licensable smart mobile operating systems and app stores for the Android mobile operating system, E.U. antitrust authorities seem to believe that Google needs to be policed from stifling innovation in the marketplace.

In its response to the European Union, Google argues that its Android operating system has made it cheaper and faster for device manufacturers to bring devices to market, lowered prices for smartphones, and increased the distribution opportunities for apps. In other words, Google bases its reply on the prevailing perspective in the United States with respect to antitrust enforcement.

The Mobile Industry Stack

To understand the issues involved in this tussle, it is important to understand that firms like Google, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook are simultaneously competing and cooperating in multiple fronts — a phenomenon we call interlocking ecosystems. Since mobile devices play an important role in making it possible for these interlocking ecosystems to work smoothly, it is critical to understand the mobile industry stack.

The typical stack is comprised of layers of functionality, each of which delivers a unique value proposition for customers. Every layer of the stack depends on the layer below to deliver its promised function. Since the layers communicate using application program interfaces (APIs) provided by vendors operating in the layer below, those vendors that dominate one layer can use their power to control how the layer above develops. In a notorious instance, Microsoft reportedly hoped to “cut off Netscape’s air supply” by threatening to withhold crucial technical support from Intel. When a company uses its own products for each layer (e.g., Apple), the industry stack is vertically integrated. When different suppliers provide the required functionality for each layer, the leadership of the stack is divided.

Android is Google’s open-source operating system (OS), which means that it can be adopted by any device manufacturer and modified to provide different functionality. As a result, 90% of device manufacturers in Europe use Android as their OS. Some modify the OS; in those cases, it is called an Android fork.

The next layer of the stack, the application layer, is the most important for the majority of today’s consumers. People pay for, download, and use third-party applications via the Google Play Store. One of the most popular apps is Google Search, which is also the primary source of Google’s advertising revenue and therefore is vital to Google’s business model.

Google requires mobile-device manufacturers to sign an “anti-fragmentation agreement,” which states that manufacturers that want to pre-install Google proprietary apps (including Google Play Store and Google Search) on its devices cannot include Android forks on those same devices. Consequently, device manufacturers that adopt the Google stack must bundle both Google Search and Google Play, which essentially locks out the other search engine providers and store fronts. In other words, while Google supports divided technical leadership for part of the stack, it tightly controls the applications layer.

From a stack perspective, Google provides free functionality at a lower level of the stack and makes up for it by charging for the higher-level functionality. To subsidize the free Android OS, Google has ensured that consumers provide data and exclusively use its search application (supported by paid advertising) in the higher layer.

From Google’s perspective, this approach has the benefit of increasing efficiency in the mobile industry stack. Google has at once freed device manufacturers from having to invest in developing complex operating systems, allowed them to focus on their core competence of designing and manufacturing of devices, and thereby lower their costs. As Kent Walker, Google’s senior vice president and general counsel, argues, Android has made it cheaper and faster for device makers to bring new devices to market. At the same time, Google suggests, it has enabled consumers to benefit immensely by falling device prices, access to a variety of devices, and ease of use of thousands of apps.

Competition Policy: U.S. vs. E.U.

Google’s argument relies heavily on the prevailing American perspective of competition policy. In the United States, legal precedents, as well as enforcement efforts, approach competition policy with consumer welfare as its lodestar. This approach argues that promoting efficiency with which firms operate leads to enhanced consumer welfare since improved efficiency leads to lower costs which in turn leads to lower prices. In that context, preserving competition in the marketplace is only a means to an end. As one observer puts it, “efficiencies are the goal; competition is the process.” By this logic, Google’s approach to the mobile stack is efficiency enhancing whereby consumers benefit.

Unfortunately for Google, the E.U. antitrust enforcers have a slightly different perspective. They, too, start off with consumer welfare as the long-run goal, but they insist that moves by rivals that could be efficiency enhancing in the short run could be detrimental in the long run, especially if those moves could thwart technological innovation and competition. In other words, E.U. authorities put more stress on what one might call dynamic efficiency in markets.

The differing U.S. and E.U. antitrust perspectives can lead to different outcomes when confronted with the same set of facts. For example, in the case of the proposed merger between GE and Honeywell, U.S. antitrust authorities gave it a go-ahead based on projected cost efficiencies whereas the E.U. authorities denied it since it has the potential to lower competition in the long run.

In the case of mobile operating system, the European Union makes three arguments, all of which have the notion of dynamic efficiency at their core.

One, the European Union argues that since “Google has made the licensing of the Play Store on Android devices conditional on Google Search being pre-installed and set as default search service,” rival search engines are not able to get a foothold in the devices sold in the European Union. Moreover, it has also reduced the incentives of manufacturers to pre-install competing search apps, as well as the incentives of consumers to download such apps. This is important because the European Union’s research has shown that consumers rarely change or delete pre-installed apps (unless the pre-installed app is of particularly poor quality). In other words, Google’s approach reduces the likelihood of future competition in search.

Two, the European Union argues that Google’s “anti-fragmentation agreement” also has the effect of reducing dynamic efficiency. It says: “Google’s conduct prevented manufacturers from selling smart mobile devices based on a competing Android fork, which had the potential of becoming a credible alternative to the Google Android operating system. In doing so, Google has also closed off an important way for its competitors to introduce apps and services, in particular general search services, which could be pre-installed on Android forks.”

Three, in the European Union’s view, Google reduces dynamic efficiency through its moves to grant significant financial incentives to some of the largest smartphone and tablet makers as well as mobile network operators to persuade them to exclusively pre-install Google Search on their devices. Again, this has the effect of denying competing search devices a toehold in the market.

Incidentally, none of these arguments is novel or without merit. The European Union has before it instances where similar issues played out to the detriment of dynamic efficiency in other markets. For instance, in its dealings with PC manufacturers in the early 1980s, Microsoft used a seemingly innocuous pricing approach to ensure that manufacturers had no incentives to install a rival operating system. This led to Microsoft achieving a near-monopoly position that has lasted to this day. Moreover, Google itself has demonstrated how keen it is to preserve its ability to collect data through its search engine. It has used its dominant position to ban the privacy app called Disconnect from its Play Store since the app can shield users against invisible tracking tools. Through its anti-fragmentation agreement, Google can probably ensure that the privacy app does not get any traction in the market.

How Google Should Respond

Based on Microsoft’s experience with European Union in the context of its browser and more recent decisions that the European Union has made with respect to other firms in the context of mergers and acquisitions, it is unlikely that Google will prevail in the E.U case if its persists with its present arguments. Google, however, could argue that one of the E.U. assumptions about competition is flawed.

E.U. authorities claim that Android is dominating the mobile OS market. While it is true that Google is dominating the OS market, OS is only one part of several ecosystems in the digital universe. For example, in the home-automation market, Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft are all competing for market share. The OS layer is only a small part of the overall solution. The conversational layer (functional layer of the stack that allows consumers to talk to machines and execute commands) is currently dominated by Amazon and Apple. There are thousands of such ecosystems, and Google is certainly not dominating all of them.

Google is one of the digital titans, a group that includes, Alibaba, Amazon, Apple, Baidu, Facebook, and Tencent. These companies use their digital superiority to participate in countless ecosystems by investing in R&D, developing partnerships, or by using APIs in shrewd and unexpected ways. In doing so, they may dominate one market and, at the same time, be a new entrant in a different market. They apply their data assets, algorithms, third-party developers, and managerial and engineering talent across multiple ecosystems.

We live in a world where companies compete by being part of an ecosystem, a world where the winners can change at any time because there are always newer, shinier, and more innovative solutions in the works. Regulators are making a mistake by simply looking at one ecosystem and declaring Google the winner. That is like declaring a Super Bowl winner based on the team that scored the most points in the first quarter of the season opener! This approach doesn’t account for adjustments and improvements made by the opposing team or by future opponents.

Note how this argument takes EU’s dynamic efficiency concerns and turns them around.

Main topic of meeting said to be job creation in the U.S.

Amazon.com Inc. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos and Tesla Motors Inc. CEO Elon Musk will be among those attending President-elect Donald Trump’s gathering of technology industry leaders Wednesday in New York, people familiar with the matter said.

An invitation to the meeting went out last week from members of Trump’s transition team, including venture capitalist Peter Thiel. Oracle Corp. co-CEO Safra Catz, Cisco Systems Inc.’s Chuck Robbins and Facebook Inc. Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg plan to attend. Alphabet Inc.’s Larry Page and Eric Schmidt will be there too, as will Apple Inc.’s Tim Cook, according to people familiar with the matter. IBM CEO Ginni Rometty -- who is on Trump’s advisory panel of business leaders -- will also attend, said a person familiar with her plans.

The main topic of the meeting scheduled for 2 p.m. Wednesday is likely to be job creation, one of the people said.

While support for Trump was thin among technology executives during the presidential campaign, Bezos and Trump clashed the most publicly. The Amazon founder mockingly tweeted that he would send the Republican candidate to space on one of his rockets, and Trump accused Bezos of purchasing the Washington Post to gain political influence in the nation’s capital to help his growing e-commerce empire.

Bezos is doing the responsible thing for Amazon shareholders in attending the summit even though it promises to be a ""groveling session made for reality TV,"" said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc.

""Bezos has to participate because he and his company were singled out,"" Pachter said. ""He has to be honorable and protect his shareholders.""

Technology leaders in Silicon Valley and beyond had openly signaled an uneasiness with Trump, with most favoring Hillary Clinton -- contributions to her campaign were 114 times the level they were for Trump, according to statistics compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. Over the summer, a group of about 140 industry figures sent an open letter decrying Trump’s views on immigration, internet security and government investment, which they said would stifle innovation and growth.

Common Ground

Other significant issues for the industry that could be discussed are possible repatriation of overseas earnings and corporate tax reform, said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation.

Cisco’s Robbins said those issues are among “pretty important potential changes we could see in the corporate arena” under Trump.

Speaking at the company’s annual shareholder meeting in response to a question about how a change in repatriation rules or tax reform would affect Cisco’s strategy, Robbins said a shift on bringing back foreign earnings is “not being positioned as a tax holiday. It would be a permanent solution which we would be very happy with.”

A lower tax rate is “where I think the jobs get created,” he said. “So we’re optimistic and we’ll see how it plays out.”

Atkinson said the meeting may address China, where several U.S. tech companies have struggled to find a foothold. Recode reported earlier that Sandberg would be there and that Bezos was likely to attend. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported the main topic of the meeting.

The gathering will also be a chance for tech’s leaders to find some common ground with the new administration.

Bezos and Trump have had a long-running spat, played out largely via Twitter, beginning last December after the candidate attacked the Washington Post for publishing unflattering reports about him.

“The Washington Post, which loses a fortune, is owned by Jeff Bezos for purposes of keeping taxes down at his no profit company, Amazon,” Trump said.

In June, Trump’s campaign revoked the Post’s press credentials, accusing the newspaper of being a front for Amazon’s political agenda. The newspaper later was the first to report on the “Access Hollywood” footage from 2005 of Trump making lewd comments about women.

Following Trump’s victory in November, Bezos sought to strike a conciliatory tone, tweeting, ""I for one give him my most open mind.""

Musk’s attendance brings a triangle of tension to the meeting. He and Bezos are both tech moguls who made their fortunes on the internet and then plowed them into space exploration. The two have sparred publicly via Twitter about the accomplishments of their space exploration companies: Musk owns Space Exploration Technologies Corp. and Bezos owns Blue Origin LLC, which are both trying to advance space exploration with rockets that can be reused like airplanes.

Bezos’s first-ever tweet celebrated Blue Origin sending a rocket to the edge of space and landing it back on Earth. Musk initially offered kudos, then in a subsequent message said: ""It is however, important to clear up the difference between ‘space’ and ‘orbit’"" to highlight the current technology gap between the two ventures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The availability of Netflix VR App On Google Play Store has a lot to offer. Remember the app is live on the play store. However, it is unfortunate that the Gear VR owners may not access it because it is not compatible with non-Daydream systems. Those that have Moto Z series and LG G5 owners, Sony Xperia XZ, Google Pixel phone series as well as X Performance series, among others with Adnroid 7.0 Operating sytemtn are also compatible with Netflix VR.

Netflix’s VR platform cannot be compared to the likes of Hulu and HBO apps, which have a bit more options to take advantage of. It is a standalone application.

It has only been two years since President Obama met with officials from the Caribbean nation in a bid to improve relations between the two nations.

The “What ifs” are daunting. Not just for Alphabet Inc, but for other large-cap tech outfits such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) or the likes of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Silicon Valley would be on the butt end of Trump’s pro-business platform if his policies are actually pursued and ultimately implemented.

For digital ads, everyone else is begging for scraps.

The Chart of the Week is a weekly Visual Capitalist feature on Fridays.

Over the next couple years, digital advertising is expected to pass television to become the largest ad market in existence.

One would think that this simple fact should translate to a bright future for many publishers, but the reality seems to be quite different. That’s because digital advertising is increasingly dominated by just two players, and everyone else is just begging for scraps.

The Ad Duopoly

Today, close to $0.60 of every dollar spent on digital advertising goes to Google and Facebook.

The crazy thing is that these are still early days, especially for Facebook, which grew its digital ad revenue by 59% last year. The social media company recently smashed Wall Street’s expectations again, as it revealed that Facebook’s mobile business alone was bigger than its entire business back in 2015 Q3.

This lopsided growth is quite the juxtaposition to the media stalwarts of the world.

Iconic brands such as The New York Times have struggled to make a full transition to digital, making only $200 million per year from the online ad side of their business. That makes the Times, along with other traditional media companies like News Corp, Time Inc, or Hearst, too “small” to even show up on our chart.

It’s a Platform Kind of World

In the digital advertising landscape, it’s all about the power of platforms. The majority of our chart is loaded with companies that have created (or bought) platforms full of user-generated content that people use every day.

(NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL).

Online holiday sales proved to be good to these internet giants, as sales are tracking to the analyst’s growth projections of 16% to 18%. However, when looking at this week’s context of the market as a whole, the stocks underperformed.

Youssef Squali has a very good TipRanks score with a 68% success rate and he stands at #27 out of 4,274 analysts. Squali garners 10.3% in his yearly returns. When recommending FB, Squali earns 24.3% in average profits on the stock. When suggesting AMZN, Squali gains 25.8%. When rating GOOGL, Squali realizes 10.2%.

“While Internet stocks rose this week, the index trailed the overall market, reflecting continued rotation into Financials, Energy, Industrials and other categories positioned to benefit most from the President-elect Trump win. YTD the group remains ahead, however, up 21.2% Y/Y,” Squali notes.

Glancing at the bigger picture and thanks to “the strength season-to-date,” the analyst sings the praises of these three key players in the tech sector.

“We feel comfortable with our forecast for 16-18% Y/Y growth in total online sales over the holiday period and continue to view AMZN, FB and GOOGL as prime beneficiaries,” Squali contends.

As such, the analyst reiterates a Buy rating on shares of FB with a $170 price target, which represents just under a 43% increase from current levels.

In regards to Amazon, a big morsel of news was the unveiling of Amazon Go, a physical store that allows customers to shop for household items without requiring them to check out, with plans for a first store to open in Seattle at the start of 2017.

The store’s technology will maximize computer vision, sensor fusion, combined with deep learning to allow consumers to pick up and put away items in their shopping bags to carry out once ready to go, thanks to a virtual shopping cart’s tracking abilities.

Squali believes, “While the concept could be potentially disruptive to retail over time, we note that Amazon plans to debut the store initially in Seattle and that a wider rollout could be some time away. We believe that Amazon will likely use this as a test location to refine the offering and gauge consumers’ responses/adoption before rolling it out on a broader basis.”

Meanwhile, online sales, specifically desktop, charged forward 13% year-over-year for Cyber Week, according to comScore data.

“While this is below the 15% Y/Y growth over the Thanksgiving weekend (Nov. 24-27), when the peak shopping season kicked off, it’s still 200bps above the 11% Y/Y growth pre-Thanksgiving, attesting to an elevated level of consumer spending during the peak holiday season (so far),” Squali highlights.

Therefore, the analyst reiterates a Buy rating on AMZN with a price target of $1,000, which represents a 30% increase from where the shares last closed.

Additionally, Squali maintains full bullish steam ahead for Alphabet after an investor conference has highlighted strides toward live television, on back of a strategic alliance with YouTube. The analyst reiterates a Buy rating on shares of GOOGL with a $1,040 price target, which represents a 30% increase from where the stock is currently trading.

“GOOGL, AMZN take aim at traditional cable bundles. CBS CEO disclosed at an investor conference this week that the company had “been able to make a deal with Youtube”, suggesting that Google is making progress in its efforts to bring an over-the-top subscription offering for live TV. Separately, Amazon announced that Prime members would be able to subscribe to HBO and Cinemax for $15/mo and $10/mo, respectively, via Amazon Channels. The latest moves highlights ambitions of Internet companies as consumers spend more time online and cord-cutting picks up,” Squali surmises.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New Tailwinds for Google Stock

Although we usually think of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) as a sprawling business, 99% of the company’s revenues are advertising-related. Google stock (GOOG) is almost entirely concentrated in this one sector, but that could change very soon.

After years of research and development, Google is finally ready to package its self-driving program into an actual business. This would mean spinning the driverless project out of “Google X,” the experimental lab where the company tests out new ideas, into a newly formed entity. (Source: “Google’s self-driving car team is hiring executives as it prepares to spin out from Alphabet’s X,” Recode, December 7, 2016.)

If you ever wondered why Google reorganized itself into Alphabet, wonder no more.

These kinds of transitions are exactly why. In the founding letter, Google founder Larry Page wrote: “Alphabet is mostly a collection of companies. The largest of which, of course, is Google.”

By Page’s telling, Google’s moonshot ideas would eventually outgrow the company, so the company needed room for them to breathe. Under the new structure, they could evolve into full companies and have their own chief executive officers, all of whom would still report to Page.

This is what we think is happening for the driverless car project.

The first rumblings came from the head of the project himself, John Krafcik, when he spoke at the Nikkei Innovation Forum in October. Krafcik was vague about the timeline, but he made it clear that driverless cars were going to “graduate” from Google X’s lab.

Now we’re seeing conspicuous hires to the driverless car team. For instance, Kevin Vosen was hired as the project’s chief legal officer. To the layperson, this hiring looks harmless. But Google X already has lawyers. The new hire, skilled as he may be, is a duplicate that makes no sense.

That is, unless self-driving cars will become a new company under the Alphabet banner. Other recent additions to the Google workforce also seem redundant. Why else would they hire a second “head of real estate” if not to make sure that the new division was staffed properly?

Only one answer explains all of the above: Google’s autonomous car division is almost open for business.

Existing carmakers like Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE:FCAU) have signed deals to license the driverless tech from Google, which is a clever way for Google to ride the autonomous car trend without the heavy costs of vehicle production.

Moreover, the market seems ignorant of its effect on Google stock (GOOG). Investors still believe that self-driving cars are 20 or 30 years down the road, but the writing on the wall says otherwise.

If driverless cars truly graduate from Google X, it’s because Alphabet executives expect it to make a lot of money. With this potential growth not priced into Google stock (GOOG), I expect there to be enormous returns waiting for the patient tech investor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Facebook surpassed YouTube in Christmas social video campaign viewership and engagement in the UK.

Facebook has been testing the introduction of a dedicated video tab inside its mobile app.

Can Facebook take a big bite of YouTube's market share in 2017?

Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) has been in the eye of storm recently due to issues like fake news and overstatement of metrics. However, advertisers are not going to flee its platform. In fact, Facebook is slowly taking the fight to industry leader Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube in terms of online video viewership and advertising. New Research also shows that video content is outperforming all other types on Facebook. Here's how Facebook is edging closer to YouTube, slowly and steadily reducing its web video supremacy.

Facebook Is Challenging YouTube And TV For Ads

Facebook has been testing the introduction of a dedicated video tab inside its mobile app among a select group of users over the past year - a move Morgan Stanley analysts predict will help the social network capture a greater share of the TV ad market. This move will also help Facebook take on Youtube, trying to become a complete web video portal. This may also eliminate Facebook's weakness in the delivery of video content, which is still very much focused on distribution and in-feed viewing. Whereas YouTube benefits from discovery and intent.

YouTube’s biggest strength is its ability to offer customers a continuous viewing experience across multiple connected devices. Facebook seems to have come up with an answer to this as well with another of their recent move. Its new feature allows live streaming of videos on your TV. 85% of videos on Facebook are watched without sound where as Youtube has a more immersive experience. YouTube thus serves as a more complete, cinematic experience than Facebook. If the new dedicated video tab becomes operational then this competitive advantage of Youtube can be reduced to a great extent.

TV ad revenue in the US totaled close to $70 billion in 2015, according to PwC’s Media Outlook. Consumers continue to increase their time spent consuming digital media, which has put pressure on traditional TV ad spenders to increase their ad budgets on digital channels like Youtube and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). The dedicated video tab will solve advertisers reservations about Facebook videos being too fragmented and interspersed between feeds. So Facebook may take a huge pie of digital video advertising revenue from Youtube.

Source: Business Insider

How Close Can FB Get To YouTube

The category YouTube belongs to is ""Google websites,"" which contributed $16.1B or 72.3% of the Google segment top-line in 3Q16. It is not clear actually how much YouTube contributes to top line figures, but it is estimated to be around $3.1B for 3Q16 by Wedbush. Youtube is expected to grow at a CAGR of 30% through 2020. However, slowly and steadily Facebook is catching up. Recently it was reported that Facebook overtook YouTube for Christmas social video campaigns in UK. 90% of all interactions and 60% of all views of Christmas TV adverts on social were via Facebook, while just under 40% of views were on YouTube, proving Facebook is where audiences head to watch and share the content they love.

Also Read: FB Stock: Facebook Inc Could Gain The Most From A Snapchat IPO In 2017

In the US alone digital video advertising is estimated to be worth $23.5B by 2020, then the global market size is much bigger. There were 3.1 Trillion Facebook video views between November 2015 and November 2016; that's a staggering increase of 94% year-on-year. With Facebook users spending an average of 50 minutes per day on the site, and over 100 million hours of daily video watch time, the reach and influence of Facebook video content is only set to increase.

Though some of these numbers may not be very accurate due to Facebook's overstated metrics. Even if you go by moderate projections of these numbers, Facebook is well positioned to take on Youtube in digital video advertising space. The ever increasing market size gives these two players enough reasons to fight for.

The Next Big Digital Ad Revenue Battle Is On Videos

Most of the consumer internet traffic in the future will be around video. According to a Cisco Forecast, videos will represent 69% of all consumer-based Internet traffic by 2017; this is expected to rise to 80% by 2019. Zuckerburg himself has said, “I think video is a megatrend, almost as big as mobile.”

The only place in videos where Facebook is lagging drastically is original content creation, but here it is taking the Youtube way by paying both individual celebrities and news outlets to use it. There are also recent reports of some famous content creators leaving Youtube and music industry not being happy with payments from Youtube, so Facebook has a ray of hope here as well. (See Also: FB Stock: Don't Sell Facebook Inc Stock, But Do Read This )

The US digital advertising industry will continue to experience remarkable growth through 2021 to reach nearly $100 billion in annual revenue, driven primarily by the sustained migration of ad dollars from traditional TV to digital video and the continued increase in social spending. Digital video advertising will grow faster than any other segment over the next five years, as consumers shift time spent online to phones and tablets. So we are definitely headed for a ‘war for video supremacy' going ahead.

Source: Forbes

It will also be difficult to change consumers' default habit of going to YouTube for video content, but for that Facebook needs to come up with the right video offering which will entice both consumers as well as advertisers.

Facebook will deliver close to $31 billion in revenue in 2017 going by a slower growth of 25% over Facebook's TTM sales number. Its sales number can shoot up drastically if it captures a sizeable chunk of the digital video ad revenue going forward and FB stock would gain from this in a big way.

Offering a dedicated connected viewing and search experience is no doubt on the cards. If it can achieve this successfully and maintain its push into premium content, then Facebook may take the top spot as a complete entertainment and social hub. It's really a daunting task to go after YouTube, but the future looks bright for Facebook Inc.

Energy Independence for Google Stock?

As we inch closer to the end of 2016, companies are starting to release their big plans for next year. As always, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) had something memorable to add: namely that it will meet 100% of its green energy requirements in 2017.

This should add an interesting new dimension to Google stock (GOOG), at least for those who are worried about climate change. Having a corporate entity—one of the biggest in the world—behave with social awareness is not something we see every day. (Source: “We’re set to reach 100% renewable energy — and it’s just the beginning,” Google Blog, December 6, 2016.)

“[We are] the world’s largest corporate buyer of renewable power,” wrote Google Senior Vice President Urs Hölzle in a blog post announcing the news. He added that Google now plans to “[directly buy] enough wind and solar electricity annually to account for every unit of electricity our operations consume, globally.”

However, this doesn’t mean that solar panels are going to be plastered to Google’s rooftops. The company is too large an organisation to simply “move off the grid.” Instead, it chooses to buy all its green energy from renewable sources, even if that means going through a traditional utility.

For instance, if a green energy company decides to set up a big farm of solar panels, rather than sell to end consumers, it signs a contract with utility companies. The solar farms feed the green energy onto the grid, which can then be purchased by companies like Google.

Utilizing these third-party sources is an important step for Google stock. Like its competitors at Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM), Google is building new data centers across the world. The existing data centers use three percent of the world’s electricity; a number that is expected to triple once these companies are done expanding.

In other words, tech companies will be consuming roughly 10% of the world’s energy supply just to power data centers. The energy demands will be extraordinary, but they have made public assurances that most of the energy will come from renewable sources.

“The science tells us that tackling climate change is an urgent global priority,” Hölzle wrote. “We believe the private sector, in partnership with policy leaders, must take bold steps and that we can do so in a way that leads to growth and opportunity.

According to the Code of Conduct, these tech behemoths vowed to implement additional measures aimed at identifying and removing blatantly hateful content, with “the majority” of user reports of such content reviewed and addressed within 24 hours.

Further, each company agreed to implement comprehensive and ongoing training for staff members tasked with addressing these reports, with focus on “current soceital developments” as they may relate to potential surges in hate speech.

Training was supposed to include and encourage participation and involvement by various “civil society organizations” whose goals were to promote tolerance and education.

Apparently, that didn’t happen.

Where These Big Dogs Have Fallen Short

On Sunday, Reuters reported that the European Commission is disappointed at the speed with which the majority of hate speech reports have been handled since the Code of Conduct was signed. Apparently, an average of only 40% of such reports were reviewed and addressed within the 24-hour window.

However, the Commission admitted that “after 48 hours the figure is more than 80 percent.” Still, that one extra day is seemingly unacceptable and has prompted the Commission to consider drawing up legisltation that would force FB, GOOGL, MSFT and TWTR to maintain the agreed-upon 24-hour timeframe for reviewign complaints.

No information has been released regarding possible specifics of the legislation, but European justice ministers are scheduled to meet later this week for a closer examination of the report.

Will This Change Anything for Users?

Generally speaking, it’s not likely. Considering the sheer number of users that these companies have (FB has more than 1.2 billion, GOOGL has more than 2 billion, MSFT has 750 million and TWTR has 317 million), the relative number of complaints regarding hate speech that have been reported over the past six months is almost non-existent.

According to CNBC, “there were 600 notifications to the tech firms regarding hate speech.” Only 316 of them were determined to have possible merit, and of those only 163 resulted in content being removed or deleted. No information was shared as to the origin of those 600 reports and whether they came from Facebook, Google, Twitter or Microsoft.

After all, GOOGL had stolen many plays from Apple Inc.‘s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) playbook. Just like Apple, the company came to the fray with the Google Pixel and the Google Pixel XL with screen sizes of 5 inches and 5.5 inches, respectively.

Source: Google

But Google was not content to just copy a few iPhone moves. The marketing strategies employed by the two companies are remarkably similar:

Both lay claim to being the smartest smartphones on the planet,

Both claim to have the best cameras in their class,

Both sport rather humdrum designs that are nevertheless pretty impressive par the course nowadays and,

Both are pretty darn expensive, with the unlocked base 32GB versions starting and $649 for both smartphones.

GOOGL though has one-upped Apple by adding a touch of exclusivity to the Pixel to differentiate it from other Android phones. This includes special features such as a Pixel Launcher, Google Assistant and Daydream. By now, you might be wondering — what kind of affect does this have on GOOGL stock?

Not so Fast, Google Pixel

Not surprisingly, Google Pixel hit the ground running. Many GOOGL stock investors were willing to bet that the company’s first smartphone ever was on track to knock Apple down a peg or two after years of dominance in the smartphone business. Pixel managed to garner many glowing reviews, with The Verge declaring it ‘‘hit a homerun,” while Ars Technica described it as the ”best Android smartphone ever.”

But current indications are that the victory dance was a bit premature. Some numbers coming from Wall Street suggest that Pixel is unlikely to live up to the iPhone-killer hype. Morgan Stanley has come up with estimates that Google will sell a respectable 3 million Pixels worth $2 billion during the final three months of 2016, but only 5 million to 6 million for the whole of 2017 once the initial enthusiasm wears off.

Comparatively, Apple sold 212 million iPhone units in fiscal year 2016 netting $137 billion in revenue. Further, Apple averaged 41% gross margin for the iPhone in 2016, almost double the 22% to 25% range analysts are modeling for the Pixel depending on the configuration. So what Pixel will add to Google’s top and bottom lines really is a drop in the bucket compared with the iPhone, a device that brings in 60% of total Apple revenues.

But these disappointing projections should probably not come as a surprise to GOOGL stock owners. Most smartphone users tend to be very loyal to their brands, and the next handsets they buy are largely dictated by past purchases.

Close to 90% of consumers that currently own an iPhone are likely to stick to the Apple ecosystem; ditto for the Android camp. Moreover, asking the average Android smartphone user to upgrade to a Pixel is going to be a tough sell. The Android smartphone average selling price hovers around $250, less than half the price of an entry-level Pixel.

The reasons Google provided mainly had to do with clarity for investors. By creating two specific segments of Google, investors and shareholders could separate the strengths of Google — namely, search and ads — from its riskier endeavors, like self-driving cars. Another reason: Larry Page, then Google's CEO, wanted to take a backseat in operations in order to focus on his bigger dreams, like the company's moonshots in health and energy.

That's all well and good for Page, Sergey Brin, and the various executives at Google and Alphabet. But one year later, if you ask a random person on the street if they know what Alphabet is, they likely wouldn't know.

This Google Trends data, which compares the volume of Google searches for ""Google"" versus ""Alphabet,"" says it all:

And that is probably the biggest benefit from the name change: Google's more controversial projects, such as its efforts to expand its reach with accident-prone drones and sensitive healthcare technology, no longer have Google's name on them. They're now owned by Alphabet, an innocent-sounding company you've probably never heard of.

Google has wrestled with its public image for years

For over a decade, Google was the darling of the Internet Age, providing the best search experience, as well as the best online maps and email experiences. Its unofficial motto was ""Don't be evil,"" a reminder that while the company manages a ton of personal data, it must never use it for ""evil,"" which would tarnish the important bond of trust Google had with its customers.

(""Don't be evil,"" by the way, also created the notion that Google would never do anything perceived as evil, which is a challenging, if not impossible, expectation to live up to.)

Toward the end of the 2000s, Google's image started to change. A big moment was when Google introduced Android in 2008 — an operating system that looked and felt a lot like Apple's iPhone operating system, which was introduced one year before. People found it suspicious that Google developed Android while its CEO, then Eric Schmidt, sat on Apple's board of directors during the iPhone's development. Making matters worse, Apple's late founder, Steve Jobs, called Android ""outright theft"" and vowed to destroy Android, fueling feelings that Google wasn't living up to that ""Don't be evil"" mantra.

Other instances in recent years where Google came across as creepy:

In 2010, Google's Street View cars were caught eavesdropping on people's Wi-Fi connections.

In 2011, Google agreed to forfeit $500 million after a criminal investigation by the Justice Department found that Google illegally allowed advertisements from online Canadian pharmacies to sell their products in the US.

In 2012, Google circumvented the no-cookies policy on Apple's Safari web browser and paid a $22.5 million fine to the Federal Trade Commission as a result.

Also in 2012, Google tried to create a single privacy policy for all of its services, which outraged some customers, as they believed this would make it easier to sell data to advertisers.

While changing the name from Google to Alphabet and reorganizing Google's various properties under Alphabet doesn't change the past, it does help prevent similar public relations debacles from happening in the future. Since it's technically Google's parent company currently working on all of its projects that might be considered ""creepy"" — like drones, self-driving cars, genetic engineering, machine intelligence, or its project to extend the human life span — the name Google is kept out of people's mouths and out of the media, to some degree.

All of this is to say Alphabet and Google are not bad or evil companies just because of this PR shift. If anything, it's extremely smart of Page and company to separate Google's uncertain experiments from its solid-yet-mundane search and ads business. But the staggering difference in public awareness between Alphabet and Google is worth noting — so if you ever see a news headline about Alphabet, just think ""Google.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The idea behind the Wing Marketplace is that it will allow customers to place orders and have them delivered in a short period of time. It would cost customers $6 for the drone deliveries. However, Alphabet Inc has been having trouble getting drones ready for deliveries.

Alphabet Inc has had two successful tests delivering goods to non-employee customers. One took place in 2014 with a delivery to an Australian rancher. The other had it delivering burritos to Virginia Tech students and teachers. This test took place in September and deliveries were made from a Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.

Alphabet Inc isn’t the only company that wants to use drones for deliveries. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) has been making its own progress with drone deliveries. It revealed earlier this this that it wants to deliver packages to customers within half an hour. However, a launch date and delivery prices have not been announced.

United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE: UPS ) is also looking into drone deliveries. It started conducting its own tests with drone maker CyPhy Works in September. The delivery service has also been using drones inside of its own warehouses for different tasks.

Now Google is getting into the mesh router game with the Google Wifi, a multi-point router system that shares more than a few similarities with Eero.

It’s funny to think that the most interesting tech products of 2016 have been routers. The router has transformed from a utilitarian computer hardware with antennas sticking out of it to multiple, sleekly designed pods that are placed throughout your home. This method of using more than one device as a wireless access point is known as a mesh system, and it promises to fix those dead zone problems traditional routers often succumb to.

Google says that the Wifi system is the product of three-and-a-half years of work — and it has previously released a router, called the OnHub. But Google Wifi is different from what Google did before. First of all, Google is making it directly. Google Wifi also leverages both clever hardware design and cloud-based intelligence to make sure you have a strong Wi-Fi signal throughout your home, no matter its size, construction, or layout. In addition, Google designed the product so that it can be easily set up via a smartphone and managed and controlled remotely. Easy guest network setup and parental controls are also part of the Wifi pitch.

Google Wifi, which is hitting stores today, is sold individually ($129) or as a three-pack ($299). That’s a lot less than the $499 Eero asks for a three-unit setup and still cheaper than Netgear’s well-reviewed $399 Orbi, yet it makes many of the same promises. Google says a single unit can cover a 1,500-square-foot home, while a three-pack will span a 4,500-square-foot residence. Additional units can be added for coverage beyond that.

I’ve spent the past week testing a three-pack of Google Wifi in my modest, two-story home. To put Google’s claims to the test, I compared it to Eero and Orbi in the same environment. Though my home isn’t especially large, it presents challenges to traditional routers, thanks to older construction and lots of walls. It’s an ideal candidate for a mesh network system, and all three systems provided much better coverage than a single router has in the past. Google Wifi, while not the fastest system I tested, hits a good balance between speed, coverage, ease of use, and cost, which makes it a compelling option if you’re looking at a mesh router system.

The Google Wifi units are designed to live politely in your home

Design has always been an afterthought with traditional routers, taking a backseat to functionality — and that has meant big, ugly designs with spidery antennas. But since mesh systems work best when they are out in the open and spread throughout your home, they should look somewhat nice. Fortunately, Google Wifi does: each unit is a compact, unobtrusive cylinder that can be tucked away on a shelf or counter and doesn’t look like a piece of computer equipment in the middle of your living room.

It’s about twice as tall as the Eero’s squircle, and can be best described as two hockey pucks that have been painted white and stacked on top of each other. There’s a lone light between the two pucks that indicates status — blue for setup, white for connected — which can be disabled via the Google Wifi app.

On the bottom of the Wifi unit is a power port and two gigabit Ethernet jacks: one for an internet connection from your broadband modem and a second to attach hardwired devices, such as hubs for smart home products. That’s about it for the Wifi’s exterior hardware — unlike traditional routers that might have multiple Ethernet ports, the Wifi needs a network switch to expand its port selection (just like the Eero). It also doesn’t have a USB port to attach a storage drive for media or backups, which many routers provide.

Under the hood, the Google Wifi has AC1200 2x2 Wave 2 capabilities and supports both 2.4GHz and 5GHz 802.11a/b/g/n/ac networking. It is secured with the standard WPA2-PSK protocol. (This is essentially the same hardware found in each Eero point.) The Wi-Fi hardware in each unit isn’t especially remarkable, but when you have multiple points in your home, the need for each one to be high-powered diminishes.

Setting up the Wifi system is done through Google’s new Wifi app for iOS and Android (formerly the OnHub app). The app walks you through setting up a new network, naming it, securing it with a password, and placing the Wifi units throughout your home. It also lets you check your network speeds, from both your ISP to the modem and from Google Wifi to your device, and the strength of signal between each node. Google’s Network Assist feature will provide tips on how to improve performance by moving a unit to a different location or will tell you when the internet from your ISP is not functioning.

In addition, the app lets you see how many devices are connected to your network, pause Wi-Fi on specific devices, prioritize others, and easily create a guest network. It also has very basic smart home features, which are limited to controlling Philips Hue lights at the moment. The app allows for remote access to the network, so you can manage it even when you’re not at home.

Getting the Google Wifi system up and running in my home was painless and took about 10 minutes total to complete. My house is not large, but it has older construction and its main living spaces are additions to the original structure, meaning that one of their walls used to be an exterior wall, which presents an even greater challenge for wireless signals. Further, the modem is located in an upstairs room, making it difficult for a standard router to reach the additions on the left and right sides of the house.

I put one Wifi point in my upstairs office, connected to my ISP’s modem. (If you have a combination router and modem from your ISP, you will need to disable its router functionality in order to use Google Wifi.) I then placed the other points in the areas where a traditional router struggles to cover: the family room on the right side of the house and the master bedroom on the opposite side.

Google Wifi provided enough bandwidth for 4K video streaming in every room of my home

I have a lot of wireless devices constantly connecting and disconnecting to the network, presenting other challenges to the router. At any given time, there might be two or three dozen (and sometimes more) devices ranging from phones to tablets to laptops to TVs to set-top boxes to light bulbs to speakers and others connected to the Wi-Fi network, which can cause difficulties with traffic routing and interference.

In each room, Google Wifi was able to provide a strong wireless signal and enough internet bandwidth for the most demanding streaming needs, including 4K video. (My home internet plan provides 200Mbps download speeds and 35Mbps uploads.) Unsurprisingly, the furthest room (our bedroom) proved to be the hardest test, but I was still able to get an average of 90Mbps download speeds in there, which is more than enough for streaming Ultra HD video.

Results are averages of three consecutive tests using Ookla's Speedtest, with server manually selected to nearest geographical location. Devices' Wi-Fi connections were refreshed at each location to force connection to the nearest node. Internet service plan is a 200Mbps / 35Mbps cable connection from Optimum Online, which enters the home through the ""Office"" location.

Compared to Eero using the same setup (main point in the upstairs office, a point in the family room and a point in the bedroom), Google Wifi provided the same amount of coverage and internet speeds. Orbi, which uses two units instead of three (one placed in the office, one in the bedroom) offered up the fastest speeds and was able to max out my internet connection in every room, including the troublesome master bedroom. But though Orbi only has two units, they are physically much larger than either Google Wifi or Eero and not nearly as discreet. Orbi is also more expensive than Google Wifi and doesn’t have an easy app-based management or setup system.

Coverage and throughput aren’t the only things that matter with a mesh system: it also needs to ensure all your devices are getting their Wi-Fi from the closest access point instead of staying connected to one further away. Google says that the Network Assist feature in Wifi will manage moving devices from point to point and switching Wi-Fi channels automatically in case of congestion. In the time that I’ve been testing it, I’ve not encountered issues where my devices lose signal or coverage because they didn’t connect to the proper access point. The Wifi app does show which point each device is connected to, but it doesn’t allow you to force devices to hop from one to another.

The question with all of these mesh router systems is do you need to invest in them at all, or will a good, standard router cover you? That really depends on your home and wireless needs, and your environment and needs are certainly different than mine. But if you’ve had issues with getting coverage from a standard router and have had to rely on things like network extenders, a mesh system is an obvious choice for your home.

Google Wifi is not the fastest performing mesh system, as borne out in my testing results. But it is less expensive than the others and is very easy to set up and use. It provided more than enough of my (generous) internet connection to reliably stream 4K video in every room, and it was able to blanket my home with a strong Wi-Fi signal, despite the multitude of devices connected to it at all times.

Google Wifi strikes a nice balance between price, performance, and ease of use

If all you care about is raw performance, Orbi is a better router, but for overall experience, including cost and maintenance, Google Wifi is an easier system to use. It’s also an ideal choice for someone looking to improve Wi-Fi in a relative’s home and manage it remotely, since the app makes it very easy to troubleshoot issues even if you aren’t physically connected to the network. Google Wifi was able to provide the same amount of coverage and experience as Eero’s system for $200 less.

Google Wifi is the next logical extension of what Google started with OnHub last year: it takes the simple setup, app-based control, and machine intelligence introduced by OnHub and marries it to a mesh system that can cover larger or more challenging areas with strong signal. And if you’re going to invest in a mesh system, Google Wifi is the one I’d pick.

Beyond its peculiar location — about 2,000 miles from the company's Mountain View, California headquarters — the site has all the standard hallmarks. There are polka-dotted employee badges, free breakfast and lunch buffets, and the company’s bright logo colors splashed over prominent slabs of wall space. It is, however, unlike most other satellite offices owned by the search giant.

That’s because it’s the location of Google’s largest US data center, one of 13 around the world. Construction began there in 2007, when Google repurposed an existing warehouse to begin handling the flood of data flowing between its fast-growing consumer products. Now, nine years later, Google operates seven different services with more than 1 billion users each: Gmail, search, Google Maps, Android, Chrome, YouTube, and the Play Store. Each of those products relies on Google’s vast network of servers and other cloud infrastructure, all of which must be supported and maintained by sprawling physical operations in places like Oklahoma, Georgia, and Oregon.

This exponential influx of users has had many positive effects. With a market cap of more than $531 billion, Google parent company Alphabet is now the second most valuable corporation on the planet, behind only Apple. Over the years, the Google name has grown from being synonymous with information and knowledge on the web to becoming the software backbone for a majority of the world’s smartphones. Google products now help us trawl the internet with ease, communicate in an instant, watch and upload 4K videos with the press of a button, and maneuver the physical world with a mobile app.

But there are inherent downsides to Google’s growth. As it has grown massive, so too have Google’s energy needs. Nowhere is that more apparent than places like its Oklahoma data center. Truck-sized diesel generators sit idly by in the event of a power outage, while cavernous halls of Halloween-colored power cables snake from substations just to provide electricity for one floor of each building on the multi-unit campus. In 2015 alone, Alphabet consumed 5.7 terawatt hours of electricity, almost as much as the entire city of San Francisco.

By 2017, Google will purchase enough clean energy to account for its global electricity needs

Google knows it can’t eliminate the problem — the company, as far as we know, is not working on cracking cold fusion. But it can ease the pain, at least in the short-term, with renewable energy. Starting next year, Google says its vast network of global operations will start purchasing as much renewable energy as it uses across all 13 data centers and all of its office complexes.

The lynchpin of this milestone is Google’s 20 renewable contracts it has accumulated over the years, which provide it with enough solar and wind power to account for every unit of electricity it consumes. Through those contracts, which have a total capacity of 2.6 gigawatts of power, Google says it’s helping spur development of clean energy projects, and in turn encouraging other companies in and outside the tech industry to follow suit.

Beyond the obvious benefits it provides the environment, Google also sees renewable energy as a competitive advantage. According to Neha Palmer, the head of strategy for Google’s global infrastructure division, investing in green energy — which in turn leads to more infrastructure investment — helps bring down the cost of wind and solar over time. Focusing on renewable energy also gives Google the opportunity to set fixed-price contracts for power in areas of high volatility.

To be clear, Google is not saying it’s currently powering all of its facilities with clean energy. The company stresses that, due to a number of a factors, it’s difficult to source every unit of electricity from a renewable source, especially when drawing power from the grid, where electrons are neither clean nor dirty. Those factors include not being able to build its own wind and solar farms to power facilities every hour of the day, and having to deal with local utility monopolies in certain parts of the world. Instead, the company purchases excess electricity in places where it can more easily obtain wind or solar energy, helping those industries grow, while unused electricity remans in the grid for anyone to consume.

Google can claim it’s 100 percent renewable, but there’s a catch

The company also purchases the corresponding commodities, known as Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), from green energy providers it sources power from. Think of RECs as a measurement of how green the energy you’re purchasing is, like the opposite of a carbon tax. Google then takes those RECs off the market, or “retires” them in utility parlance. That signals that the corresponding electricity is being used by its owner, and that the REC itself is not being swapped or sold on the commodities market.

In the long-term, Google plans to power its operations every day of every year with clean, zero-carbon energy. Doing that, says Palmer, means “working toward buying more renewable energy in every area that we operate.”

That investment begins at places like Minco-II, a wind farm located about 50 miles outside of Oklahoma City. The site is operated by NextEra Energy Resources, the largest operator of wind and solar-generating sites in the US. Google now uses all 64 turbines at Minco-II, which, as a 100 megawatt wind farm, generates 438,000 megawatt hours of electricity in a year. That’s enough to power 30,000 homes.

There is another part of the equation, one Google has more direct control over: efficiency. By improving how its data centers make use of the massive amount of power they consume, Google can both lower its energy consumption and, in some cases, squeeze more out of the same amount of power. Compared to five years ago, the company says it now delivers 3.5 times more computing power with the same amount of electricity in certain portions of its data centers.

This is an area where Google’s artificial intelligence prowess is being put to use. In collaboration with its DeepMind subsidiary, Google now uses machine learning algorithms to optimize its data center performance. In effect, the very same algorithms that are trained with mass troves of data and run across Google’s vast network of data centers are now being deployed to make those same data centers more efficient.

Google is using artificial intelligence to optimize its energy use

After tinkering with the AI software, Google found that it could reduce the amount of energy used for cooling by up to 40 percent. “In principal, the machine learning algorithms are sucking in all of this data and being able to project with very good accuracy what’s coming next,” says Chris Malone, a distinguished engineer at Google who oversees data center efficiency.

Because a data center contains so many facilities, each with specific cooling needs, there are billions of settings combinations to ensure equipment is kept at an optimal temperature. Humans could never figure out what works best on any given day due to changes in wind speed and humidity and dozens of other factors, Malone says. But a machine can.

This kind of insight is something Google thinks other companies could make use of. “I do know that a lot of learnings can be applied to other industries,” says Joe Kava, the head of Google’s data center division. “If you’re a large industrial plant, whether it’s petrochemical, oil and gas, or just large metal fabrication, it’s a lot of the same things. Power going in, which means heat, and getting that heat out.”

Kava says the company is in talks to provide its machine learning algorithms as part of the Google Cloud platform. The ultimate goal, of course, is not necessarily to reap profits — Google makes more with its ad business than it could ever generate through licensing data center software.

Instead, the company stresses that what’s good for the planet is simply good for business, and it thinks other industries will see the light. “It goes beyond this sector. You have chemical companies and healthcare companies seeing that it could be done in a cost-effective manner,” Palmer says. “More customers will demand this.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""I tend to look forward and I think we need to figure out how to constructively engage with the new administration and hear the voices of people,"" he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And while one day does not make a trend, this is at least worthy of our attention. Considering that the prospects of a further year-end rally in stocks remains very much on the table, GOOGL stock and other tech equities could once again be atop the list of stocks to chase higher.

Before going any further and digging into the charts, there are two important points to understand for the month of December, as far as the stock market is concerned:

While seasonal patterns often work as a good guide to the general direction of the stock market in various parts of the year, the year-end or “Santa Claus” rally in my opinion is one of the most reliable seasonal patterns.

To respect the possibility of this year-end lift in stocks, it is important to understand the dynamics behind it.

Similar to other month- and quarter-end periods throughout the year, December is a time when fund managers window-dress their portfolios. This is the practice of buying strong-performing stocks during the period and selling down losing ones to show investors that the fund was invested in the right stocks.

In December, this practice is magnified because under-performing fund managers also must try one last attempt to meet or beat the benchmarks against which their performance is measured, which in turn forces them to chase those stocks higher that had the best performance or show the most promise.

Thanks to this phenomenon, tech investments such as GOOGL stock could once again be on the buy radar heading into year’s end.

GOOGL Stock Charts

When I last discussed GOOGL on Nov. 17, I offered that the stock market seems to be rotating back into the tech sector. Since then, Alphabet shares have indeed bounced, but the year-end lift hasn’t really taken off.

Google’s autocomplete feature aims to suggest common searches after a user enters one or more words into the site’s search box or address bar of its Chrome browser.

Typing the phrase “are Jews” into Google, the search engine suggested “evil”, for “are women” it again suggested “evil” and for “are Muslims” it suggested “bad”, an Observer article reported.

Google, democracy and the truth about internet search Read more

On Monday the searches for Jews and women no longer returned those results, although the “are Muslims bad” autocomplete was still present.

A Google spokesperson said: “We took action within hours of being notified on Friday of the autocomplete results.” Google did not comment on its decision to alter some but not all those raised in the article.

It said: “Our search results are a reflection of the content across the web. This means that sometimes unpleasant portrayals of sensitive subject matter online can affect what search results appear for a given query. These results don’t reflect Google’s own opinions or beliefs – as a company, we strongly value a diversity of perspectives, ideas and cultures.

“Autocomplete predictions are algorithmically generated based on users’ search activity and interests. Users search for such a wide range of material on the web – 15% of searches we see every day are new. Because of this, terms that appear in autocomplete may be unexpected or unpleasant. We do our best to prevent offensive terms, like porn and hate speech, from appearing, but we acknowledge that autocomplete isn’t an exact science and we’re always working to improve our algorithms.”

This is not the first time Google and others’ autocomplete and search algorithms have caused offence. An auto-suggested photo tag within Google’s Photos service in July 2015 labelled two black teenagers as “Gorillas”. Google apologised and said it was working on “longer term fixes” around the recognition of dark-skinned faces as well as the linguistics of photo labels.



In May 2015, Google apologised when the White House was returned as a result for searches for “nigger house” and “nigger king” within Google maps.

Google declined to explain why the results occurred but a spokesperson said: “Some inappropriate results are surfacing in Google Maps that should not be, and we apologise for any offence this may have caused.”

In April this year Google apologised after a search for “unprofessional hairstyles for work” yielded image results showing predominantly black women with natural hair, while searching for “professional” ones returned pictures of coiffed, white women.

In June, Google’s image search also caused offence by returning criminal mugshots for searches of “three black teenagers” but not for “three white teenagers”.

Google has hired former Republican operatives before and this job isn't new (the previous policy specialist in the role once worked on Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign). But the listing suggests the internet giant is mobilizing to push its multi-faceted agenda with the incoming administration. Google is likely to voice positions on several key political issues, including data encryption, antitrust, telecom rules and autonomous vehicles. On several of them, Trump's policies are uncertain.

The company has kept relatively quiet since the election. In an interview with the BBC the week after, Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai noted how the results reflected a deep divide in the U.S. ""We need to figure out how to constructively engage with the new administration and hear the voices of people,"" Pichai told the British broadcaster. A Google spokesman declined to comment on Monday.

Prior to the election, Eric Schmidt, Alphabet's chairman, was more vocal, expressing willingness to help Hillary Clinton's campaign, according to e-mails obtained by WikiLeaks. He was photographed at a Clinton gathering on the evening of the election wearing a ""staff"" badge.

Although Google eschewed lobbying in its early years, it has turned into one of the largest corporate forces in Washington. Alphabet has spent $11.9 million so far this year, ranking it in the top five among U.S. companies, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

Eleven years later, YouTube has grown to have 5 billion videos watched a day, 1.3 billion total number of users, an estimated annual revenue of $10 billion for 2016 and yet it is not profitable. In fact at a recent summit, the CEO of YouTube had stated that it is still in investment mode. Originally purchased in October 2006 by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) for $1.65 billion, it is now estimated to have a valuation of $70 to $90 billion on its own. Making about 13% - 17% of the current market cap of Google, we wanted to do some analysis of the risks and opportunities that YouTube has coming ahead. Especially since there have been recent videos put out by major content creators including PewDiePie, the #1 most subscribed YouTuber, contemplating quitting the service.

History

Starting out as a failed dating website, who knew YouTube would end up being the central hub for video content today. Chad Hurley, Steven Chen and Jawed Karim came up with the idea back in 2005 when they figured the website would work as a dating website where single people would post up videos of themselves to attract others for dates. In fact on the main page of the website you would be entering in your sex and age. Like most success stories, this one had humble beginnings. No one used the first iteration of this website. The creators were so desperate for users that they put Craiglist ads to pay for people to upload videos on their website.

It was the original community who really defined what YouTube would be. Instead of making dating related videos, users would instead upload videos of everything else to share with their friends and family. The original community of YouTube was what led the original founders to revamp the site to be more open and general to entice others to upload videos of whatever they wanted. This is the backbone of what YouTube is today. After Sequoia Capital help fund this venture and began looking for advertisement deals, YouTube began to really hit off with the general public. In fact it was this famous Nike Ad to be the first video to reach a million views. In 2006, Google purchased the company after seeing the potential this platform had for advertising. The following is a synopsis of risks and opportunities we see ahead for YouTube.

YouTubers quitting and increased competition

It was this video by YouTuber PewDiePie quitting that inspired me to write this article. Now it remains to be seen how serious he is to go through with this promise but there is always a risk of talent leaving and taking their subscriber base as well. His main complaint was the subscriber dumps that YouTube would go through from time to time. YouTube does this to get rid of ""ghost"" accounts. ""Ghost"" accounts are determined based on their viewing history and will be removed from a channel if they have not had any recent views of that channel. Although it does hurt a channel from an aesthetics point of view due to lowering their subscriber, this is a necessary process. By removing accounts that no longer watch your content, it allows YouTube and the advertisers find a better match for their ads based on your subscriber base.

There are many reasons why YouTubers quit such as stress or running out of creativity. However there has also been some instances of poaching. Two years ago, there was a huge push by Yahoo to reinvent itself and become more competitive with Google. One of their tactics was to lure content creators by enticing them with higher ad revenue share. Currently Google retains 45% of the advertising earned by content creators. In 2015, Vessel was on the hunt trying to poach content creators by enticing creators with higher CPMs. YouTubers earn about $2-3/CPM vs. what Vessel claimed to be able to provide $50/CPM. Their caveat was that content creators also would release videos on their website three days ahead of being released on YouTube, creating an early access pay wall. Coincidentally, both of the aforementioned companies were both purchased by Verizon (NYSE:VZ) in 2016. Although there has yet to be a viable competitor, there will always be future competitors who will attempt to dethrone YouTube. There has been a lot of consolidation in the media place such as AT&T (NYSE:T) and Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) and I would not be surprised if a media giant were to attempt enter the online video space in the future.

The Black market of Online Advertising

YouTube marketing is strong because it can achieve the holy grail of marketing, which is advocacy. Advocacy in marketing is a term which describes the type of marketing that we receive from friends and families. YouTube builds this relationship with viewers through the trust gained by the content creators. In a recent Nielsen report, it found that users trusted online consumer opinions 66% of the time when making a purchase. Due to the fact that YouTube is on the frontier or marketing, it is no surprise that it has also created its own ""black-market"" for advertising.

On a larger level there has been illegal product placement such as the Xbox One controversy. In summary what happened was that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was paying gaming channels to promote their product in a positive light without disclosure that they were being paid to do so. It is explicitly outlined on the FTC website that this is illegal.

On a smaller level there has been paid shills to YouTubers without disclosure (pictured below). The email below was to a fellow smaller YouTuber with only a few thousand subscribers who reviews tech parts. When he replied back to the email telling them they would review the product for free if they got a demo, they got back an email stating that they would only get the product if they gave positive reviews.

If the FTC were ever able to crack down on this illegal black market for advertising dollars it could serve to be a windfall to YouTube. Currently these advertising dollars are being diverted away from YouTube by going straight to the YouTuber. By removing this black market it would increase the amount of money going into legal advertising giving benefit to YouTube.

Valuation

At the end of the day, we want to know how much our investment in YouTube will be worth in the future. Since YouTube is not generating any earnings right now, the only method of valuation we can use is a price multiple on sales. Taking the average of related companies, the Max, the Min and Google's current valuation, we were able to get within the valuation metrics that were being touted by Wall Street. Next using the same metrics we wanted to calculate the value of YouTube in four years, 2020, to see how much the valuation of YouTube growth alone could add to Alphabet's market cap. The growth rates that UBS has proposed in YouTube revenues does present an interesting growth opportunity that implies as high as an annualized 8% share increase just based on YouTube's growth and assuming the rest of Alphabet does not grow at all.

Conclusion

YouTube has grown up in the past 11 years and it still has a lot to grow. Based on the growth projections, Google could be a fantastic long-term holding for any portfolio. While the media may be over blowing the vast exodus of key subscribers of YouTube, it is clear that Wall Street will not quit on YouTube if there is money to be made.

But India may be the bigger prize. In the latest indicator of the importance of India as a market to American tech giants, Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google Allo messaging app now supports Hindi.

Source: Google

The market for the consumer products that big technology companies like Google and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) sell is becoming saturated in North America. There are only so many Android phones and and iPhones you can sell here, especially when almost everyone already owns one.

China or India?

A mature market means the days of record-setting sales quarters are ending.

Thats why countries like China and India are looked to for growth. Their populations dwarf that of North America and there’s a growing demand for smartphones.

China has often been considered the prize. Its population of 1.357 billion is over four times that of the U.S. and wealth has been rapidly building in the country — along with a demand for high-tech gadgets.

However, China is a tough nut to crack. It’s home to many competing technology firms like Xiaomi and Oppo that are selling home-grown smartphones at a fraction of the price of an iPhone. The government and its strict policies (including censorship) can be difficult to deal with, as companies from Google to Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) have discovered.

Given the challenges in China, India has become an increasingly attractive market.

With a population of 1.25 billion, it is nearly as large as China. Like China, India has a growing economy and an expanding middle class, but India is a decade or more behind China in its econonomic development. So moving on India now means getting in early, unlike China which requires considerable effort to establish a presence.

In addition, India’s government is seen as being easier to deal with by Western technology companies and India lacks the powerhouse local technology companies that have been taking over the Chinese smartphone market.

Google Allo Goes Hindi

There’s no Chinese version, but Google is now rolling out Hindi support in its Allo messaging app, in a clear nod to the importance it places on the Indian market. As Ars Technica points out, this is just the latest in a series of India firsts for the company.

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is down roughly the same. Investors have been rotating out of tech and into other categories such as banking and energy, which seem like sure-fire beneficiaries of the Trump Administration.

But as is the case with most selloffs, the current dip in tech stocks is providing a nice opportunity for value investors.

I think everyone should be jotting down tech stocks to buy on their Christmas wish lists. But investors should still keep in mind that there are some serious headwinds facing the sector.

Yes, Donald Trump has offered up heated rhetoric about immigration and trade — both critical areas that can affect the fortunes of tech companies. But there’s also a lot of uncertainty regarding Trump’s policies in general, and that alone can have another adverse effect on the tech sector. That is, that could make numerous companies less willing to make big-ticket tech purchases.

12/2/2016,0.436288135,0.104085835,744.59,754,743.1,750.5,1452484,10.9,5.91,1,"Let’s talk about F.A.N.G a.k.a. four of the internet most popular stocks: Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX). Canaccord analyst Michael Graham has been out with a mostly positive forecast for the quarter. However, on three of the four, the analyst reigned in the price target on stocks he has nonetheless hailed as “beacons of growth.”

The big four were all down in market trading on Wednesday afternoon. Even so, the analyst is riding the bullish train for the long-term as he sees these stocks as leaders of the large-cap tech-verse, particularly considering that “three of the FANGs comprise half of the six fast-growing large-cap tech stocks.”

What are the drivers for these tech giants in terms of growth? Graham cites four crucial wave makers: digital advertising, digital video consumption, eCommerce, and cloud services. From where the analyst is standing, the drivers remain “very much intact” and therefore, growth should sustain, and as revenue growth continues to be steady, “investors keep returning.”

As far as Graham sizes up Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google, he asserts, “The FANG stocks have had two very strong years, outperforming the market by a wide margin. The stocks had a more mixed Q3, with more diverse performance following earnings, and a group-wide (short-lived) selloff following President-elect Trump’s victory. We still think these stocks will perform well through 2017, although we recommend fine-tuning relative exposure within the group based on your time horizon.”

Why should you trust Graham’s opinion? According to TipRanks, five-star analyst Michael Graham is ranked #241 out of 4,243 analysts. Graham has a 52% success rate and garners 8.6% in his annual returns. When recommending FB, Graham earns 22.9% in average profits on the stock. When suggesting AMZN, Graham gains 7.1%. When rating NFLX, Graham realizes 20.1%. When advising GOOGL, Graham yields 14.0%.

Let’s explore the stocks that make up the crux of the tech court:

Facebook Global User Base Still Growing by 15%- Impressive

With regards to Facebook, Graham sees the social media titan facing the greatest impact now that companies, investors, and regulators alike are choosing to shift focus from non-GAAP to GAAP metrics.

Even so, the analyst advises to buy in light of the titan’s “multi-faceted revenue growth story” which features a well-rounded arc of users, engagement, ad load, ad pricing, as well as newer services.

While there are a couple of risks, from ad load warnings to near-term concerns from advertisers who might be wary of issues with measurement, Graham reiterates a Buy on FB while trimming the price target from $160 to $150, which represents a close to 30% increase from where the shares last closed.

Meanwhile, advertisers are corralling to the platform, to the tune of 4 million as of third-quarter, thanks to global user and monthly active user (MAU) growth as well as some enhanced engagement with “dramatic” possibilities to gain further abroad.

The analyst opines, “We dusted off our 2013 initiation report on FB in which we estimated 2017 ad revenue at $17.6B. Our current estimate for next year is more than double that number at $37.5B, and while we are patting ourselves on the back with one hand for recommending this juggernaut for 3+ years, with the other hand we are scratching our head trying to figure out how we so dramatically underestimated FB’s potential.”

Ultimately, “Investors seem to still be largely focused on revenue for FB, and we continue to be comfortable with the outlook. We are modeling 35% ad revenue growth in 2017, down from 61% in 2016, and we believe this should be easily achievable given the multiple drivers,” Graham surmises.

TipRanks analytics exhibit FB as a Strong Buy. Out of 38 analysts polled in the last 3 months by TipRanks, 35 are bullish on Facebook stock, while 3 remain sidelined. With a return potential of 37%, the stock’s consensus target price stands at $158.03.

Amazon Prime Flywheel Presents Buying Opportunity

As the Amazon Prime flywheel fires up eCommerce growth rates and surges in scale and volume drive increases in Amazon Web Services (AWS), Graham likes the prospects for a “manageable competitive environment.”

Therefore, despite awareness of margin pressure and a “price war” brewing for AWS that could prominently shake up margins, the analyst reiterates a Buy rating on shares of AMZN while pulling back on the price target from $900 to $875, which represents a just under 18% increase from current levels.

As the analyst deduces, “Steady growth in eCommerce revenue has been largely taken for granted by investors over the last couple of years, and this is even more true so far in 2016, when eCommerce revenue growth both internationally and domestically has stayed above 26%. This has been the result of excellent execution around selection, price, and fulfillment. More recently, however, management commentary has centered on the ‘Prime Flywheel’ which involves even faster, free shipping and a variety of other services (‘free shipping with Netflix and Spotify thrown in for free…’).”

Guesstimating two-thirds of eCommerce revenue for the online auction and e-commerce leader likely stems from the U.S. coupled with 65% of Prime members, or roughly 43.5 million, in the U.S., out of a projected total of 70 million Prime members from 350 million customer accounts, the analyst likes Amazon’s positioning.

“We believe Prime is the lens through which Amazon management is viewing the company’s opportunity,” Graham postulates.

TipRanks analytics demonstrate AMZN as a Strong Buy. Based on 35 analysts polled in the last 3 months by TipRanks, 33 rate a Buy on AMZN, while 2 maintain a Hold. The 12-month average price target stands at $946.39, marking a 27% upside from where the stock is currently trading.

Netflix: One-Two Punch of Original Content Value and International Expansion Possibility

Meanwhile, Graham commends Netflix for its substantial runway ahead in terms of potential development internationally and sees the streaming giant’s original content as key, comparing its importance to the likes of fulfillment for Amazon.

As such, amid concerns of competition, subscriber comp challenges awaiting the first half of 2017, and deficient support for valuation in the short-term, the analyst reiterates a Buy rating on NFLX with a $140 price target, which represents an 18% increase from where the shares last closed.

The analyst notes, “Netflix launched in its first international market (Canada) in 2010. It then launched across most countries in Latin America in 2011 and several countries in Western Europe in 2012. We estimate that the largest single international markets by subscribers are the U.K., Canada, Brazil, Germany, Mexico, and Japan currently.”

Additionally, Graham sees, “Along with these top markets, there are several other opportunities from recent launches and emerging economies. Due to Western Europe’s mature economy and media landscape, we think these markets could ramp faster. Specifically, the Nordics, France, Spain, and Italy all seem poised for greater near-term adoption.”

Overall, “We think Netflix’s international expansion is still very much in the early stages. While the top international markets are at ~12% penetration, layering in newer mature markets and some of the larger emerging one shows that Netflix is still merely in mid-single digit penetration of the total addressable market,” Graham determines.

TipRanks analytics indicate NFLX as a Buy. Out of 37 analysts polled in the last 3 months by TipRanks, 20 are bullish on Netflix stock, 11 remain sidelined, and 6 are bearish on the stock. With a return potential of 5%, the stock’s consensus target price stands at $123.29.

Alphabet (Google): Re-Accelerating Website Revenue Key to Success

As Alphabet’s stock has been circling a 40% rise from summertime 2015, Graham is banking on the company’s ad innovation and website revenue growth as key drivers to maintain full confidence ahead. As YouTube’s evolution spirals forward and in face of prospective multiple expansion, the analyst likes the tech giant’s odds over the risk of Mobile, Programmatic, and YouTube applying pressure to gross margins.

Therefore, Graham reiterates a Buy on shares of GOOGL while cutting the price target from $950 to $925, which represents a 21% increase from where the stock is currently trading.

A key to GOOGL’s success lies in its website revenue growth, as the analyst explains, “We believe the most important driver of this move has been the re-acceleration of Websites revenue growth, which progressed from 13% in Q2/15 to 16% in Q3 and 20% in Q4. This important growth rate then stayed well above 20% so far this year, and this is an important psychological level for the stock.”

Moreover, Graham considers, “The likely key driver of this resurgence in growth has been essentially ad load on both mobile search and YouTube (discussed below), with the company adding a third mobile search ad unit that started gaining traction in Q2/15 but really hit its stride in Q3.”

Ultimately, “We estimate YouTube revenue growth will decelerate from 48% in 2016 to 37% in 2017, but at ~15% of Websites revenue next year, this relatively high growth rate is an important tailwind. We estimate that YouTube will be 18% of Websites revenue in 2020. As it grows larger in the mix, its higher growth rate than search revenue should help buoy the overall top-line for many years,” Graham concludes.

TipRanks analytics show GOOGL as a Strong Buy. Based on 27 analysts polled in the last 3 months by TipRanks, 26 rate a Buy on GOOGL while 1 issues a Sell. The 12-month average price target stands at $968.33, marking a nearly 27% upside from where the shares last closed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alphabet's board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to about $7 billion of its Class C stock. While the repurchase program is probably a good idea, is it big enough to really make a difference?

Well timed, but too small

Alphabet's third-quarter announced repurchase program isn't its first. It follows a $5.1 billion repurchase program initiated in the third quarter of 2015. Interestingly, a review of how this program fared can provide some useful insights for the new program.

The first thing to note about Alphabet's $5.1 repurchase program is that it was well-timed. Share repurchases have the biggest positive impact when they are executed at a lower stock price than where shares end up later on. Fortunately, Alphabet was able to purchase its shares at a discount with its $5.1 program. The stock is up about 20% since Alphabet started repurchasing shares. Further, since about half of this gain came after Alphabet had already exhausted its authorized $5.1 billion repurchases, the timing of the program was particularly keen.

But because $5.1 billion is hardly a large sum given Alphabet's $521 billion market capitalization, and adding in the fact that Alphabet was averaging over a billion dollars every quarter on stock-based compensation, the net effect of these repurchases were more preventative than accretive when it came to reducing total share count.

Indeed, Alphabet's Class C share count is actually higher in 2016 compared to 2015, despite the $5.1 billion repurchase program.

This isn't to say Alphabet's repurchase program isn't making a difference. Without these repurchases, Alphabet's share count would be even higher today. Further, since the repurchases were well timed, Alphabet essentially got more bang for its buck than it was actually spending. But this $5.1 billion repurchase program does show that Alphabet is going to need a much bigger authorization if the repurchases are going to have a meaningfully accretive impact on earnings per share.

Still not big enough

While Alphabet's new repurchase program is larger, it arguably doesn't represent the jump investors should be hoping for. Like its $5.1 billion program, the $7 billion program will likely also fail to reduce Alphabet's total share count, and it may even fail to fully take advantage of an opportunistic period.

In Alphabet's third quarter alone, the company diluted shareholder ownership with $1.63 billion in stock-based compensation, up significantly from about $1.28 billion of stock-based compensation in the year-ago quarter. Assuming stock-based compensation continues to grow alongside Alphabet's expected revenue and net income growth throughout 2017, its stock-based compensation during the first twelve months of this program is likely to match or even exceed the $7 billion authorized for repurchases.

And looking beyond the simple fact that Alphabet's share repurchase program isn't likely big enough to help reduce its share count, it's also arguable that Alphabet is simply hanging on to too much cash. In its most recent quarter, Alphabet's cash and cash equivalents hit $83 billion, up 14% from its $72.8 billion in the year-ago quarter. Further, the search giant is generating significant free cash flow, or cash from operations less capital expenditures, every quarter. In its third quarter alone, Alphabet raked in $7.3 billion in free cash flow.

The big question mark with Alphabet's new $7 billion repurchase program -- or any repurchase program for that matter -- is whether the timing of purchases will be right. While I'd personally argue that Alphabet's shares are still undervalued, a sell-off in the overall stock market, a recession, or unexpected competitive headwinds, could drive the stock lower and render Alphabet's conservative repurchases today great decisions in hindsight.

But considering Alphabet's incredible lead in online search, paired with the company's heady cash flow, I'd bet investors would benefit more from an even larger repurchase program.

Maybe Alphabet's decision to repurchase $7 billion this time around instead of $5.1 billion is the beginning of a trend that could turn into more aggressive repurchases down the road. But will Alphabet have missed a great opportunity by then?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Like its competitors from Microsoft and numerous startups, App Maker promises to make it easy for anybody to quickly develop basic apps that serve a very specific purpose inside an organization.

The new service features a cloud-based drag-and-drop development environment that lets you build the user interface and populate it with data from your G Suite applications, Google Maps, Contacts and Groups and virtually any service that offers an API. These applications then run on the same infrastructure on which Google’s own G Suite apps run, and IT admins can also manage them in exactly the same way as Gmail, Drive and other G Suite applications.

The typical use case for these kind of apps are time-tracking solutions, or tracking orders and inventory — essentially any problem inside a company that can be easily digitized and solved by a very basic custom app.

The advantage here, Google argues, is that users won’t have to worry about any of the underlying infrastructure (the buzzword here is “serverless”) and that it allows them to develop apps that solve their very specific needs without the need to bring on a developer. Users who want to delve deeper, though, can also do so thanks to the built-in scripting editor, which — from the looks of it — feels like a pretty fully featured IDE.

App Maker is now available through Google’s Early Adopter Program for G Suite Business.

In addition to the App Maker announcement, Google also today announced that it is adding a few new enterprise applications to its “Recommended for G Suite” program. This program certifies that an application is well-integrated into G Suite and that it has been tested for security vulnerabilities. The new partners the company announced today are Virtru, LumApps, DocuSign, Freshdesk, Zoho Invoice, Xero and Asana.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Earlier this year, though, the company announced that it would finally give Sites a full overhaul. Today, after a short beta, this new version of Sites is going live for all users.

Google Sites is essentially a drag-and-drop website builder for creating both public facing web pages and intranet sites that’s deeply integrated with the rest of Google’s tools. You can easily insert documents from Google Docs, Slides, Sheets and the rest of the (unfortunately named) G Suite tools into any site, for example. It also directly integrates with Google Analytics. The new sites now also allows multiple users to collaboratively edit a site (using the same tech the company also uses in Google Docs).

Admins can choose whether users are able to publish to the web or only able to make their pages available to users on their own domain.

With this update, any pages you create in Sites will also automatically scale according to the screen size you are using — and its preview mode makes it easy to see what a site will look like on a phone, tablet and desktop. In order to make those sites look halfway professional, Google added six new themes to get you started. All of these themes come with customizable font and color settings, but I hope Google will add a few more options over time.

Sadly, it doesn’t look like you’ll be able to easily move existing sites over to the new experience (which made our Editorial Director here at TechCrunch rather unhappy), but at least for the time being, you’ll be able to jump back and forth between the old and new editors. Update: A Google spokesperson told us that Google will provide and recommend options for migrating from the classic Sites to the new Sites in 2017.

Most importantly, though, Sites is now a product people will want to use. It finally feels like a modern applications and not like the last vestige of Google’s old and forgotten design principles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an email announcement last Sunday night to select subscribers, Verizon signaled how it intends to compete with those two powerhouses, outlining its plan to combine offline information, such as postal address, email address and device type, with AOL browser cookies, Apple and Google advertising IDs, and their own unique identifier header. Coupled with all of their customers’ browsing history and app usage, this mass of customer data will make for a rich competitive product to Facebook and Google.

Facebook, Google and now Verizon are in fast pursuit of the holy grail for digital advertising — syncing up a consumers’ personally identifiable information with all browsing history and app usage.

There’s just one problem: This practice requires explicit opt-in consent from consumers under the new FCC privacy rules. Although the rules are not yet required to be adopted (and notably on the chopping block in a Trump presidency), it's hard to argue that Verizon’s plan doesn't violate the spirit of the rulemaking.

Verizon’s unilateral move to compete with Google and Facebook is likely due to the fact that the well-documented “duopoly” collectively takes more than 100 percent of the incremental growth in digital advertising — their gravy train is tied to the data which fuels their direct-marketing businesses. Why? Because Google and Facebook have a unique ability to link up personally identified users with browsing history, app usage and location across the device graph.

It’s been nearly two years since I wrote for Recode about Verizon and Turn’s massive zombie cookie stumble which ultimately led to an FCC investigation and settlement. It was a prime example of the breakdown in consumer trust, which we had been highlighting for years, and presciently previewed the ad blocking crisis to come. It also inspired DCN to express its concern to the FCC when the agency deliberated how to enforce privacy rules for broadband. After all, ISPs have a unique ability to see nearly all of your internet traffic, not unlike Google and Facebook.

Whether it’s a third party like Facebook or Google tracking across the web, or an ISP leveraging its distribution arm, this is outside of consumer expectations.

Enter ad blocking. The primary consumer grievances inspiring installation of ad blockers are now widely understood: Ads infringe on user privacy, obscure content, expose users’ devices to security hazards, and hoover up bandwidth and slow page loads. As the IAB’s LEAN standards bear fruit, we expect several of these concerns to be pacified. However, the industry is willfully ignoring the canary in the coal mine — consumer privacy. While the “A” in LEAN refers to the industry’s self-regulatory AdChoices program, consumers need even more protection and better privacy tools.

Meanwhile, Facebook, Google and now Verizon are instead accelerating their tracking efforts, despite privacy concerns appearing consistently in the top reasons for using an ad blocker. They are in fast pursuit of the holy grail for digital advertising — syncing up a consumers’ personally-identifiable information with all browsing history and app usage:

Facebook was the first company to do this at scale across devices, due to its persistent login for the service. The social network was only missing an ability to track browsing history and app usage across the web, which it solved in 2014 by proliferating the web with “Like” buttons to passively track consumer web usage under the disguise of being a consumer feature. Google held fast on its privacy promise for nearly a decade until the pressures to compete with Facebook and link up personal info across devices became too significant. In October, investigative reporter Julia Angwin uncovered that Google had quietly erased its ban on personally identifiable web tracking by linking up its massive DoubleClick tracking arm with its personal info from Gmail. The most extensive data brokers can collect thousands of points of data on consumers, but their accuracy and capabilities are limited by not being able to link up to personal information. My most recent review of BlueKai’s detailed registry of what they think they know about me was littered with bad information.

Whether it’s a third party like Facebook or Google tracking across the web or an ISP leveraging its distribution arm, this is outside of consumer expectations. Importantly to the digital media industry, it also devalues the context and relationship of consumer trust which drives the businesses of premium publishers. While we were hopeful that the new FCC privacy rules would shift value back to publishers, we now recognize that they’re in limbo without backing from the White House. It’s unfortunate that Verizon has chosen to bury them before the new guy even shows up at the door.

Advantage: Ad blocking.

Best Buy’s ad indicates that the deal is not restricted to in-store purchase only, so the web store listing link for the Home should reflect the price change after 5PM ET on Thanksgiving Day.

While it does have its limitations now just a little over a month after launch, Google Home is a solid alternative to Amazon’s Echo speaker. Instead of using a personified AI, like the Echo’s Alexa or Apple’s Siri, Google relies on voice-powered variation of its Google Assistant, the same software that powers its new Allo chat app. Still, these speakers are mostly used to play music, get basic web info, and do small tasks like setting timers and checking directions.

Internet trolling, fake news stories, information “echo chambers,” and the dark side of social media have headlined discussions on the future of politics and culture, particularly after the U.S. presidential elections. Perhaps no one is better suited to address this challenge than the man behind Google.

“We, and I personally, believe very strongly that more information is better, even if it’s wrong,” said Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google’s parent company Alphabet, Inc.

“Let’s start from the premise that more information, more empowerment, is fundamentally the correct answer” to the world’s most pressing challenges, Schmidt said Thursday after accepting Foreign Policy’s Diplomat of the Year award.

Google is facing scrutiny in the aftermath of a presidential election season headlined by hacking, falsified news, trolling, and hateful rhetoric on the net. On Tuesday, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said fake news sites bankrolled by Google-served ads could have swung the election results in President-elect Donald Trump’s favor. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg pushed back against similar accusations, saying it was “extremely unlikely” that his social media platform swayed the election, despite new findings indicating fake news performed better than real news on Facebook during the election.

Pichai said Google has already taken steps to confront the fake news phenomenon. “From our perspective, there should just be no situation where fake news gets distributed, so we are all for doing better here.”

In a discussion Thursday night with FP CEO and Editor David Rothkopf, Schmidt touted Google’s recent tests to combat trolling. “I’m absolutely convinced that these questions about validity, good information, bad information, will be sorted out,” he said. On trolling, Schmidt said “there’s a straightforward technological solution to an evil behavior. It’s easy to do, we did it, it can be replicated. And there’ll be more such solutions.” Google announced a new project to automatically fact-check news in ‘real time’ earlier Thursday.

Schmidt also stressed the positive impact of information on the world. “It’s amazing how powerful the need for information is and how information-starved everyone is. So let’s start by celebrating…that we are busy empowering people in a way that is fundamentally different,” he said, citing the economic, educational, and security benefits a person in the developing world gains from just a cell phone.

Schmidt joined awardees Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo and Hafsat Abiola, founder of the Kudirat Initiative for Democracy (KIND) on stage at FP’s awards dinner. Tech talk wasn’t the event’s only agenda item. Climate change also dominated the evening’s discussion.

Hidalgo, receiving the Green Diplomat of the Year Award on behalf of C40 Cities, called climate change “the most important challenge humankind has ever had to face.” In December 2015, a landmark international climate change deal was brokered in Hidalgo’s city. Now that deal may be under threat as Trump, a vocal skeptic of climate change, steps into the Oval Office.

“Climate change is not just a bad movie or a bad reality show,” Hidalgo said, a tacit poke at the real estate mogul and reality TV star who just won the U.S. presidency.

Amid talks of cyber war, fake news, and climate change, Abiola gave a message of hope and optimism at FP’s dinner when she received the Citizen Diplomat of the Year award.

“What we hope depends on who is in our corner,” Abiola said, speaking of the optimism she shares for the future of her native Nigeria and the United States, despite the reality of each country’s political challenges. “The distance between hope and reality is partnership, collaboration, solidarity,” she said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Google Earth VR has been in development for some time, and it bears conceptual similarity to the version of Street View that Google released on its Cardboard and Daydream platforms. But where Street View offers strings of photospheres collected by 360-degree cameras, users of Earth VR can virtually fly freely around a topographical reconstruction of the globe, or take guided tours of places like Manhattan and Monument Valley.

For now, Earth VR is Vive-only, although VR Apps product manager Mike Podwal says Google is “actively exploring support for other platforms.” It’s the second Vive app that Google has released, after popular painting app Tilt Brush, which it acquired along with VR development studio Skillman & Hackett in 2014. And like non-VR Google Earth, it’s a little rough — many areas are just flat maps with rough topography, not fully constructed locations, and natural features like trees are blocky low-poly masses. But as virtual tourism goes, it’s a fairly grand option.

Earth VR has obvious tie-ins with other parts of Google’s virtual reality efforts. Podwal and Earth VR engineering lead Dominik Kaeser see the project as a natural complement to Street View, although its full motion controls wouldn’t yet work on a platform like Daydream. At some point, the two could seamlessly blend into each other. Earth also seems like a natural fit for Expeditions, Google’s Cardboard-based VR education initiative.

But it’s more exciting to think about what people could do with an open version of the app, or a tool like the non-VR Google Earth Tour Builder. You could embed your own stories into Google Earth, or link personal photo spheres to specific places. Businesses could offer a VR version of their neighborhood the way they might embed a Google Maps widget on their website.

But so far, that has only extended to the digital photos we take, as well as our personal videos. The company is today working to change that with the launch of a new tool called PhotoScan that can help you to turn printed photos into high-quality digital copies. The end result is that older photos detailing your family’s history and the pre-smartphone era can also become a part of your Google Photos experience.

Unlike digital photos, printed photos tend to showcase more important moments, as people were more choosy about which pictures to take because of the price of film and prints, explains David Lieb, the Product Lead for Google Photos, whose team developed PhotoScan.

“But it’s very likely that you’ll lose these photos permanently,” he adds. Google estimates there are trillions of print photos out there in the world, and it wants to bring them online.

Currently, there are a handful of ways to turn printed photos into digital ones. You can ship them off via postal mail to a scanning service, you can buy a scanner and manually scan each one by yourself, or you can use your phone to take a picture of the existing, printed photo.

The latter is what many people already do (as evidenced by the Throwback Thursday postings), simply because it’s easiest.

But this doesn’t tend to lead to high-quality photos. Instead, images snapped with your smartphone camera tend to have a glare from the overhead light streaked across the image; they often are not properly aligned; and, if not cropped, may even show the table or surface they’re resting on as part of the digital copy.

Google PhotoScan instead will help you take photos of these prints, then automatically address all these common problems.

The way it does this is interesting. The simple mobile app, when launched, takes you directly to the camera’s viewfinder. Overlaid on top of the view of the print you’re about to snap a photo of are four white dots. You guide the phone over each dot by moving it slightly, which allows Google to take multiple shots of the photo from different angles. What you’re doing here is getting different images where the glare has been moved around, too.

Above: PhotoScan in action

PhotoScan then stitches those together to produce a single image without the glare. The app also automatically rotates the image, aligns it and removes the background (e.g. the tabletop). An in-app editor allows you to make a few tweaks of your own, if desired, too. The photo can be saved to your phone’s photo gallery, where you can share it as you please.

It’s worth pointing out there are a number of alternatives to PhotoScan on the market, like Photomyne, Ancestry.com’s Shoebox, Heirloom, Memories and others. But while they may crop and straighten, none are using this idea of combining multiple angles to eliminate the glare.

Though designed by Google Photos’ team, PhotoScan doesn’t directly upload to the photo-sharing service. Instead, you’ll need the Google Photos app installed if you want these print-to-digital images to upload automatically.

Once in Google Photos, the company is also rolling out new, advanced editing tools, including a better “auto enhance” feature, tools for making granular adjustments to light and color in photos and a dozen new photo filters. The filters are also powered by machine learning, and will edit the photo based on its brightness, darkness, warmth or saturation before applying the new style.

The updated Google Photos app is rolling out today.

PhotoScan is also going live today as a free download on both iOS and Android.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Google has confirmed plans to build a new headquarters in London and create 3,000 jobs, in a move that will be seen as a vote of confidence in Britain’s prospects after Brexit.

The project, which involves building a vast headquarters next to Google’s existing base in King’s Cross, central London, was thrown into doubt by the EU referendum and disagreement about its design.

But Google’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, said that while the firm has reservations about Brexit, it will not be dissuaded from building an office capable of housing 7,000 staff.

In a speech on Tuesday at Google’s London office, Pichai said: “Here in the UK, it’s clear to me that computer science has a great future with the talent, educational institutions, and passion for innovation we see all around us. We are committed to the UK and excited to continue our investment in our new King’s Cross campus.”

Pichai’s public approval dispels any lingering doubts about a plan, first tabled three years ago, that is slated to create 3,000 new jobs by 2020. But he did warn that the government’s expected crackdown on immigration after the vote to leave the EU runs counter to Google’s ideals.

“In our experience as a company, when we have been able to bring people together and operate in an open and connected way it achieves tremendous impact over time,” he told the BBC. “Those are the values we cherish, and we have been open and public about how we think about these things.

“Increasingly, for the kinds of complex things we do, we need to bring people who are across many disciplines – with many different backgrounds – together to solve problems,” he added. “That’s how you can build newer things, so that is particularly important for us.”

London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, welcomed the announcement, and argued that it put paid to fears that Brexit would damage the capital’s position as the leading European technology hub. “This is a vote of confidence in our great city – creating high-skilled jobs, supporting growth and demonstrating that London is open to business, new investment and talent from around the globe.

“London is one of the world’s leading technology hubs and investment into the capital post-Brexit remains robust, so Google’s expansion will further strengthen our city’s reputation as a global leader in digital technology.”

In a nod to Canada, whose immigration website collapsed after the election of Donald Trump, Khan said: “London is open, and our website is not going to crash.” As to whether London will benefit more directly from Trump’s election, he said it depended on how close the prime minister and the president-elect end up being.



The chancellor, Philip Hammond, said the confirmation of the Google development was a “big vote of confidence in Britain’s leading position as a global tech-hub and more evidence that leading firms are choosing to invest here”.

The new building, which will be Google’s UK headquarters, was reportedly thrown into turmoil in 2015 when bosses in California rejected the original plans, by London-based architects AHMM, for being “too boring”, and brought in Thomas Heatherwick, the designer of the new London bus, the Olympic cauldron and the garden bridge.

The 10-storey “landscraper” will be as long as the Shard is tall, and have a floorspace of 650,000 sq ft (60,400 sq metres). The original plans were for a £1bn building with a climbing wall, rooftop pool and indoor football pitch.



The new building will lie alongside the railway station, in an area currently used by King’s Cross theatre for shows including The Railway Children, In The Heights, and the David Bowie musical Lazarus.

Google will continue to occupy its current building, a 380,000 sq ft office at nearby 6 Pancras Square which has room for 2,500 employees. Construction on a second building that Google will occupy but not own began earlier this year, with Google’s move due in 2018.



In contrast, the new headquarters will be designed and owned by Google, a first outside the US. But it could prove problematic for the company if its tax affairs in the UK are not cleared up in the meantime.

In January this year, Google agreed to pay a £130m settlement to HMRC, but continued to insist that its presence in Britain is minimal, and doesn’t constitute a “permanent establishment”. Instead, under the company’s internal structure, the majority of income from British customers is technically spent in Ireland, where Google’s advertising sales department is based.

With the growth of Google’s DeepMind subsidiary, a pure research AI firm founded in London and currently based in the King’s Cross offices, as well as the company’s decision to own and design the headquarters, those claims could be subject to reassessment, if the firm does not choose to change its affairs first.

Pichai told the BBC: “As a company, we want to be a good citizen in every market we are in and that is true for the UK as well … but I think it is important to remember that we are one company in a global system and it is more important for governments and citizens to sort out the right structure and we are always happy to engage in a thoughtful and constructive manner.”

Heatherwick’s design agency, Heatherwick Studio, has had mixed success in recent years. Its new bus for London was welcomed as a design icon by the then mayor, Boris Johnson, but was criticised by passengers for ineffective air cooling and by environmental campaigners for being less fuel efficient than the buses it replaced.

Heatherwick Studio is working with Danish architects Bjarke Ingels Group on the project. In a joint statement they said that the goal with the new building was to “create an interestingness that fits the scale and the community of King’s Cross. The Silicon Valley startup garage meets the London train sheds in a building that couples clarity with eccentricity and anchors innovation with heritage.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One — called Quick, Draw! — gives you a prompt to draw an image of a written word or phrase in under 20 seconds with your mouse cursor in such a way that a neural network can identify it. It’s both a hilarious and fascinating exercise with broader implications for how AI can self-learn over time in key AI research areas like image recognition and optical character recognition.

Quick, Draw! is a great way to familiarize yourself with how neural networks work to identify objects and text in photos, which is one of the most common forms of AI-guided software techniques we see daily on platform’s like Facebook and Google Photos. As you start to craft the doodle, Quick, Draw!’s software automaton will start yelling out words and phrases it thinks you’re trying to illustrate. As you get closer to the finished product, the voice starts to become a good indication of how your drawing could be misinterpreted as something else. If you’re on point, however, the neural network will hone in on the object and guess correctly.

It’s fascinating because it shows just how difficult developing and training this type of technology is. When asked to draw a speedboat, I had to think critically about how a machine intelligence would reasonably differentiate between a sailboat and a speedboat. That meant my doodle couldn’t have a sail or be shaped like a half moon. It could, on the other hand, be relatively boxy and generic so long as the AI understood the object was supposed to be located on the surface of the water. In its post-doodle analysis, Quick, Draw! informed me that it thought my drawing could have been of a shark or a sea turtle. Over time, this neural network will learn from its mistakes and improve as more people play with it.

If you’re interested in checking out Quick, Draw! and other Google-powered AI experiments, head on over to the company’s new website. From there, you can choose between a number of new games and exercises created by programmers, artists, and even those without traditional AI and machine learning backgrounds. Google wants its AI Experiments initiative to be a creative play space for anyone to explore, and it’s taking new submissions starting today.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The search giant said Tuesday that it had hired two high-profile AI researchers to lead a new machine learning unit that’s part of its Google Cloud business. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that generally refers to training computers to recognize patterns amid tons of data. The two new hires are Fei-Fei Li, the director of Stanford University’s Artificial Intelligence Lab; and Jia Li, the head of research for Snap, the parent company of popular social messaging app Snapchat.

The two women are considered by analysts to be experts in the field of computer vision, a subset of artificial intelligence that involves teaching computers to recognize objects in images.

Speaking at a press event Tuesday in San Francisco, Google’s ( goog ) head of cloud Diane Greene explained that the new hires are part of Google’s effort to formalize an artificial intelligence group into its business. Instead of focusing on only AI research, the team would work on incorporating cutting-edge data crunching into various Google Cloud products like its software that businesses can use to predict sales .

Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.

Greene said the new hires represent the “world’s leading research scientists, practitioners, and leaders” in the hot field of artificial intelligence. Companies like Google, Facebook ( fb ) , and IBM ( ibm ) are investing millions of dollars in AI-related technologies like deep learning that have made it possible for computers to more quickly perform data-heavy tasks like translating text into multiple languages.

Greene said that “one of the most thrilling things” about the new hires is that both of them are women. The field of AI has been criticized for its lack of women in prominent research roles at universities as well as at major technology companies.

In a Bloomberg News article earlier this summer, Li commented on the dearth of women in AI, saying, ""If you were a computer and read all the AI articles and extracted out the names that are quoted, I guarantee you that women rarely show up.""

For more about Google , watch:

Li helped create the popular ImageNet computer-vision contest, which helped spur AI researchers to use cutting-edge data crunching techniques like deep learning to identify objects in photographs.

Jia Li will start work at Google after the Thanksgiving holiday and Fei-Fei Li will start at the beginning of 2017, according to a Google spokesperson.

Rob Craft, the group product manager at Google cloud and its machine learning unit, said that the two new hires will help Google ""bring machine learning to the rest of the product categories."" He explained that the new hires are part of Google's efforts to more effectively bridge together its research unit and its core business.

But hiring the appropriate talent with expertise in machine learning and related tasks does not come cheap.

Craft said the competition for hiring A.I. experts is fierce and in many cases ends up resulting in companies like Google paying ""NFL signing bonuses"" for the talent. Google did not say how much it is paying the two new hires.

Part of the reason for the competition is that there are only so many A.I. workers available and that ""the universities aren’t graduating PhD level"" candidates as fast as Google would like, Craft said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Google said it is working on a policy change to prevent websites that misrepresent content from using its AdSense advertising network, while Facebook updated its advertising policies to spell out that its ban on deceptive and misleading content applies to fake news.

The shifts comes as Google, Facebook and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) face a backlash over the role they played in the U.S. presidential election by allowing the spread of false and often malicious information that might have swayed voters toward Republican candidate Donald Trump.

The issue has provoked a fierce debate within Facebook especially, with Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg insisting twice in recent days that the site had no role in influencing the election.

Facebook's steps are limited to its ad policies, and do not target fake news sites shared by users on their news feeds.

""We do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news,"" Facebook said in a statement, adding that it will continue to vet publishers to ensure compliance.

Google's move similarly does not address the issue of fake news or hoaxes appearing in Google search results. That happened in the last few days, when a search for 'final election count' for a time took users to a fake news story saying Trump won the popular vote. Votes are still being counted, with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton showing a slight lead.

Nor does Google suggest that the company has moved to a mechanism for rating the accuracy of particular articles.

Rather, the change is aimed at assuring that publishers on the network are legitimate and eliminating financial incentives that appear to have driven the production of much fake news.

""Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property,"" Google said in a statement.

The company did not detail how it would implement or enforce the new policy.

MACEDONIA NEWS

AdSense, which allows advertisers to place text ads on the millions of websites that are part of Google's network, is a major source of money for many publishers.

A report in BuzzFeed News last month showed how tiny publishers in Macedonia were creating websites with fake news - much of it denigrating Clinton - which were widely shared on Facebook.

That sharing in turn led people to click on links which brought them to the Macedonian websites, which could then make money on the traffic via Google's AdSense.

Facebook has been widely blamed for allowing the spread of online misinformation, most of it pro-Trump, but Zuckerberg has rejected the notion that Facebook influenced the outcome of the election or that fake news is a major problem on the service.

""Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic,"" he wrote in a blog post on Saturday. ""Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes.""

Google has long had rules for its AdSense program, barring ads from appearing next to pornography or violent content. Work on the policy update announced on Monday began before the election, a Google spokeswoman said.

The company uses a combination of humans and artificial intelligence to review sites that apply to be a part of AdSense, and sites continue to be monitored after they are accepted, a former Google employee who worked on ad systems said. Google's artificial intelligence systems learn from sites that have been removed from the program, speeding the removal of similar sites.

The issue of fake news is critical for Google from a business standpoint, as many advertisers do not want their brands to be touted alongside dubious content. Google must constantly hone its systems to try to stay one step ahead of unscrupulous publishers, the former employee said.

Google has not said whether it believes its search algorithms, or its separate system for ranking results in the Google News service, also need to be modified to cope with the fake news issue.

Fil Menczer, a professor of informatics and computing at Indiana University who has studied the spread of misinformation on social media, said Google's move with AdSense was a positive step.

""One of the incentives for a good portion of fake news is money,"" he said. ""This could cut the income that creates the incentive to create the fake news sites.""

However, he cautioned that detecting fake news sites was not easy. ""What if it is a site with some real information and some fake news? It requires specialized knowledge and having humans (do it) doesn't scale,"" he said.

But for $79, £69 or AU$119, Google's new Daydream View could be the break we've been waiting for.

Update, January 2017: It's on sale for $49 through February 25, only in the US.

It's a soft cloth eyebox that turns any compatible phone into a VR headset, and it comes complete with its own Wii-like motion controller for manipulating objects and menus in VR.

It's the easiest VR to use by far.

But does that mean you should run out and buy one? Not necessarily. Not yet, anyhow.

Magical but murky

One of the pitfalls of most VR is the number of cords, ports and things you have to adjust. The Daydream View puts them all to shame. Here are the steps to set it up:

Open the headset's front door and remove the included controller

Turn on your phone (if it's off) and place it on the door

Close the door, place the headset on your head and adjust until the image looks clear

Adjust the straps

Hold down a button on the controller to calibrate, and start playing.

That's it. No adjusting the lenses, no fiddling with pairing procedures, no ports or cables to plug in. The phone automatically pairs with the headset and adjusts the screen to the correct position, like magic. You can put them on over your glasses with little difficulty, too.

Once you're inside, the included motion controller makes navigating menus a breeze. Just point where you want to go, and a little mouse cursor follows your motion quickly and accurately.

Enlarge Image Josh Miller/CNET

Just know that ""easy"" doesn't mean ""perfect.""

When I handed the Daydream View to my colleagues, many of them instinctively put it on the wrong way. The curved straps are supposed to rest on top of your head (like a crown) but it's tempting to cinch them down like a pair of ski goggles -- which isn't terribly comfortable.

1:10 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF

And though the Daydream View is almost entirely made of soft, cushiony fabric instead of hard plastics, that didn't stop my wife and colleagues from complaining how front-heavy it was with a large Pixel XL phone inside. Even if it weighs less than a pound (roughly 0.85 lbs with the phone) there's still potential for neck strain over time.

The image quality is good -- I definitely felt like I was somewhere else! -- but it's not going to fool anyone who doesn't want to be fooled. It lets a little bit of light in the edges unless you've got a very wide head. And I often found I had to recalibrate the headset and controller in the middle of a session (it's easy -- just hold down the home button).

I even found a bug that makes VR totally unusable until I reboot the phone -- though I understand a software fix for that is coming soon.



Here's the rub: unless you have a Google Pixel or other Daydream-certified phone, the Daydream View won't work at all. That's by design: Google's pitch is that Daydream can keep you from getting sick in VR by ensuring both phones and apps meet a certain quality standard.

I haven't gotten sick -- so far.

But that means a murky future for Daydream, because we honestly don't know how many phone manufacturers and app developers will wholeheartedly support Google's new platform -- or if the results will be as good as these preliminary ones. Even the 5-inch Pixel offers a lesser experience than the 5.5-inch Pixel XL, because its screen is lower-resolution.

We tried another upcoming Daydream phone, the Huawei Mate 9, only to find out it may not be Daydream-ready until next year.

Today, Google steps up its public efforts to diminish European concerns over its mobile market dominance, and it’s doing it with the power of GIFs.

You don’t think we offer choice, says Google, but have you seen how little choice iPhone buyers are getting? All the preloaded apps on an iPhone come from Apple. 39 out of 47 preloaded apps on Windows 10 phones come from Microsoft. But less than a third of preloaded apps on Samsung’s Galaxy S7 come from Google. So what’s the big deal?

Extending the point beyond apps, Google argues that it’s impossible for Android to have a market monopoly when the iPhone exists. ""To ignore competition with Apple,"" says Google, ""is to miss the defining feature of today’s competitive smartphone landscape.""

The problem at the heart of the European investigation is actually Google’s control of its Play Store, which is the central portal for app distribution on Android and pretty much essential to any new Android smartphone. And since Apple doesn’t license or open-source iOS, and Microsoft’s Windows 10 has no mobile ecosystem to speak of, any new smartphone in Europe that isn’t an iPhone is compelled to carry Google’s apps.

Because Android manufacturers have to have the Play Store on their phones, Google can practically dictate whatever terms it wants to the companies signing up for the privilege. And that’s how it is that the basic suite of Google Play services and apps are installed on every new Android smartphone by default, including such apps as Google Maps, Google Play Music, Chrome, and YouTube. Granted, most of these are the best apps in their class, but the European Commission’s antitrust body is more worried about unfair market power.

But Google’s GIF counterarguments are strong. The Mountain View company also points out that apps like Snapchat, Spotify, and Dropbox have enjoyed hundreds of millions of downloads on Android, which runs counter to the notion that Google is suppressing competition. Google has its own messaging, music, and cloud storage services, and yet its mobile platform is open enough to sustain more popular alternatives without a problem.

What Google is saying, in a nutshell, is that Android is too flexible and manipulable by the user to ever really be locked down and anti-competitive. Okay, so Samsung, LG, HTC, Huawei, and anyone else wanting to sell an Android phone is practically forced to ship it with Google apps on board. Is that really such a big deal if people can get their favored apps for free anyway? And moreover, Google makes the economic argument that ""distributing products like Google Search together with Google Play permits us to offer our entire suite for free,"" so if you really like Google’s mobile apps and don’t want to pay extra for them, you should be happy with the status quo.

That’s Google’s argument, and the question now is how compelling the Euro regulators will find it when they reconvene to consider imposing substantial fines on Google’s practices.

11/7/2016,0.431722186,0.141628146,774.5,785.19,772.55,782.52,1585070,12.64,8.02,1,"It looks like the last picture show for one of Google’s efforts at expanding into more detailed vertical search pages. Without much notice, the search giant has closed down its standalone movie site where people were able to search for cinemas, films and show times on a particular date and near a specific location, rolling some of the functionality directly into its main search portal. “Google Showtimes”, as the service was called, now brings up a 404 error if you try to visit its main page.

The “about” description, however, linked above, provides the following message:

“Google Showtimes was discontinued on 1 November 2016. You can now discover show times on the search results page by searching for the name of the movie that you want to see or try searching for the word ‘movies’ to discover what’s in cinemas.”

A spokesperson declined to comment further about the closure and whether it was part of one of Google’s recurring spring cleaning (or autumn cleaning, as the case may be) service closures.

It’s not clear why Google decided to shut the separate portal but there are some signs that Google Showtimes what not much of a blockbuster for the company, and perhaps even ran counter to how Google sees some of its bigger developments in search and media.

Google’s movie portal looks like it first went live in some form in the autumn of 2005, and as you can see from a screenshot from October 2016 below, it never updated much beyond its interface based around Google’s original, very simple, pared-down aesthetics in its original search experience.

This was actually a good thing, it seems, as groups of (now former) users on Google’s product forums, Reddit, and elsewhere who are complaining about the closure note the contrast with competing services from the likes of Fandango and Movietickets — which, may look more snappy but are less useful for finding cinemas and films based on specific locations and times that might not be exactly where you are at that precise moment.

Those users now appear ready to throw their popcorn at Google for retiring Google Showtimes and funneling some of the features into Google.com, which presents basic results like this when I search for a theater or film here in the UK at Google.com:

It looks like Google didn’t do much in the way of selling ads against Showtimes, meaning that the traffic that was resulting from it, such as it was, didn’t necessarily convert to revenue for the company.

Google Showtimes somewhat went against bigger trends in the film industry, which is bracing itself for another tough year where cinemas are concerned. Box office ticket sales for 2016 are on track to be the worst in a century, according to Vanity Fair.

Google Showtimes also stood separate from the wider industry trend for streaming and Google’s own ambitions to become a platform for distributing and consuming video, coming as it did a full year before the acquisition of YouTube (and many years before services like Android TV).

Instead, Google Showtimes appeared to germinate more from the company’s strategy to expand into more vertical search categories, providing landing places for people who are going to the web to look for specific information and choosing specific portals to get there, rather than Google’s catch-all Google.com, a trend that has grown with the rise of smartphone use, where people want fewer steps between looking for something and arriving at an answer.

That effort has resulted in the building of an extensive mapping product, Google Maps, but also portals like Google Flights for plane ticket searches and Google Finance for financial news and data. It may be that while Google is still working on new search experiences beyond Google.com, they are more likely to be based around other vertical definitions (like mobile, location, and so on) than Google might have originally conceived.

Indeed, Google Showtimes is not the first vertical portal that Google has shut down. Google’s hotel finder now lives within Maps, rather than as a separate site.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its first carrier partner on the initiative is Sprint, which is rolling out RCS messaging to its customers with Android devices, starting today. Once enabled, RCS will offer Android users an enhanced messaging experience over SMS, with features like better group chats, high-resolution photo sharing, read receipts and typing indicators.

Google announced its plans to move in this direction when it acquired RCS provider Jibe Mobile back in September 2015. The Jibe cloud platform will power the new service on Sprint, says Google.

Sprint subscribers will have their standard SMS experience upgraded through Google’s redesigned Messenger app on their Android devices, provided they are on Android KitKat or higher, and have set Messenger as their default SMS application.

Those using select LG and Nexus phones from Sprint will be automatically upgraded to RCS through an app update, while others can manually update their devices by downloading the Messenger app from the Play Store.

Google’s new Pixel-branded smartphones come with Messenger pre-loaded, so if a customer is using an unlocked device on the Sprint network and has Messenger installed, it will also have access to RCS.

Beginning next year, all new Android devices from Sprint will come with Messenger preloaded as the default SMS and RCS messaging app, says Google.

For consumers who gain access to the new messaging experience on Sprint Android phones, they’ll be able to take advantage of features that rival Apple’s iMessage or other third-party messaging apps. For example, though MMS today supports group messaging, you can’t do some of the things people now expect – like naming the group, adding new members, or leaving an existing group. That will change with RCS.

In addition, Sprint users will be able to share 100x larger images and videos than was possible with MMS, will know if messages are delivered or read, and will see typing indicators when someone is writing to you.

RCS, as a technology, has been around since 2007, but it has only been launched by 49 carriers worldwide, according to the GSMA. However, the organization says that Sprint is the first to launch the new RCS profile initiative – the other launches involved older iterations on the standard.

This is also the first time Google itself has rolled out RCS support anywhere in the world. (The now Google-owned Jibe platform, of course, had previously supported older versions of RCS, however.)

While positioned to some extent as a way Google can compete with iMessage, the problem with RCS is that it’s not universally adopted. Unlike with iMessage, which works with any Apple device, RCS is made available by carriers, and it won’t work on older Android smartphones. In other words, the impact of this launch – for now, at least – is limited.

Google says it has plans to launch RCS with other carrier partners in the “coming months,” but won’t speak to which ones, or when.

In the meantime, the move seems to muddle Google’s messaging ambitions even further. After all, where is Google placing its bets these days?

To take advantage of RCS, Android users on supported devices have to use Google’s Messenger app as their default client. But, at the same time, Google continues to offer its Hangouts chat and calling app, and it’s promoting its new Allo app as the future of messaging, thanks to its integrated A.I. assistant. Allo also comes pre-installed on Google’s new Pixel smartphones, the Pixel and Pixel XL. (Hangouts can be set as the default SMS app, Allo cannot).

Allo does work cross-platform – as does Duo, its video counterpart – but they are both rather late entries into larger messaging market, where third-party apps like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and others now dominate.

And, in terms of competing with iMessage, Google simply doesn’t have the same infrastructure in play.

By owning the entire platform – from hardware to software – Apple is able to lock users into its own iMessage ecosystem on any Apple device. And now, it’s even running a new App Store on top of that platform.

Google may be able to convince more carriers to roll out RCS in the future, but that will take time. And the technology won’t be as front-and-center as iMessage is in Apple’s world, as users on supported devices have to upgrade their apps, switch their default settings, and/or upgrade from older Android phones to use it. In the meantime, fragmentation will continue among RCS and non-RCS Android devices, not to mention Google’s own growing number of alternative messaging apps it can’t seem to stop creating.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Like many tech enthusiasts, I’ve been using a $180 Amazon Echo intelligent speaker at my home for a year or more. And, while I love using it for some things — playing music and podcasts, setting timers, and re-ordering items from Amazon — I’ve come to realize that, like Apple’s Siri and all other virtual assistants, its Alexa voice-driven artificial intelligence system disappoints a lot.

So I was excited to test Google Home, the $129 Echo competitor that puts the search giant’s much-touted new Google Assistant intelligence technology inside a small, but powerful Echo-like speaker and microphone unit. Surely, I thought, after collecting all that info about the world (and about me) for years and years, Google would crush Amazon in the home-intelligence race.

But after nearly a week of using two Google Home units in two different rooms, my conclusions are decidedly mixed. Google Home does beat Alexa and the Echo in some ways, but it’s remarkably dumb in others. It needs enough work that, if I were Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, I wouldn’t be losing any sleep about it, at least not yet.

Really? It looks so good!

In my opinion, and, more importantly, that of my wife (whose taste is much better than mine and whose tech addiction much less) the Google Home looks a lot better than the Echo. While the Echo is a tall black metal cylinder, Google’s contender is a smaller, more stylish, white plastic cylinder with an angled top and a mesh speaker base. You can get alternate bases in different colors. The top is touch sensitive, and has built-in lights that show when the Home is ready to accept a command. It snaps to attention when it hears the trigger phrases “OK, Google” or “Hey, Google”. (The Echo’s trigger phrase can be set to simply “Alexa”, “Echo” or “Amazon”.) You can raise or lower the volume, or pause or resume something, using voice commands. Or you can control the volume by tracing a circle on the top and play / pause by gently tapping it.

I were Jeff Bezos, I wouldn’t be losing any sleep about Google Home

I ran into some glitches with setup, which is performed using an Android or iOS app called Google Home. My first unit wouldn’t recognize my Wi-Fi network and I had to use a temporary workaround to get connected. Google said that might be because I was using an Eero router system. It says it has seen issues with Eero and is working to resolve them. The Echo just a few inches away had no problem with the Eero Wi-Fi and neither did the Google Pixel phone or iPhone I was using, also within inches of the Google Home.

In the case of both Google Home units, the app reported trouble completing an initial update of the device. Google says it believes this was a bug which it will fix.

It’s not OK, Google. There’s an election going on!

In my tests, it was often a toss-up as to whether the Google Assistant or Alexa would do better.

For instance, when I asked “who’s running for president?”, Home listed the two main third-party candidates as well as the major-party nominees; the Echo left out Gary Johnson and Jill Stein.

But when I asked Google Home, in four different ways, to give me the latest election polls, it answered “Sorry, I can’t help with that yet, but my team’s helping me learn,” the device’s go-to excuse. The Echo piped right up with the latest average of polls from the respected site RealClearPolitics. Google says that, by election day next week, Home will be able to say who’s won or who’s winning for president, via a variety of queries — but that seems a tad late.

Google Home currently only supports a single Google account

Google Home knew the address of my office. The Echo told me either the address of the nearest post office, or, when I asked using the words “work address”, said it couldn’t help. But, while Google Home couldn’t give me any info about my calendar (which is kept on Google Calendar, but via a different account), the Echo knew all about it. (Google Home currently only supports a single Google account. I chose my personal account, which contains most of my search data. Google says it’s working on enabling multiple accounts.)

Lincoln vs. Lipitor

When I asked “where is the nearest pharmacy?” (a question suggested for reviewers by Google), Google Home was dumb. It listed three. One was the correct answer (a CVS) — but with the wrong address. A second was the clinic inside the same drugstore, which isn’t a pharmacy. The third was a nearby supermarket that lacks a pharmacy. The Echo gave me the CVS and also the nearest Walgreens, plus two smaller ones.

Google Home couldn’t take a note or set a reminder, like the Echo can. Google says it’s working on adding that.

The Home’s speaker is a bit fuzzy

On the other hand, Google Home carried on a conversation with me about Abraham Lincoln, telling me first when he was born, and then answering several other queries about him without requiring me to repeat his name. The Echo couldn’t do this. Home gave a detailed answer to the question of when Jimmy Fallon was in the cast of Saturday Night Live, while the Echo had no idea.

For playing music, Google mostly did well. Home supports Spotify and Pandora, but I set it to rely on Google’s own Google Play and YouTube services. It handled even my hand-crafted playlists fine. But it occasionally stopped playing a song for a few seconds and then resumed.

While the sound from Home was quite good, my wife and I preferred the Echo’s sound slightly, both for music and voices. The Echo’s speaker was crisper, the Home’s a tiny bit fuzzy, to our ears. Also, on at least one album (the “Sleepless in Seattle” soundtrack), Home repeatedly declined to play more than one song, while the Echo played them all.

Like the Echo, Google Home can control some third-party smart home devices, but I couldn’t test this, as I have decided not to help bring down the internet by owning such devices.

Video via voice

Home is much less versatile than Echo, because it lacks the thousands of third-party apps (or “skills”) that the latter boasts. But it has its own special trick: it can, via a voice command, allow you to cast streaming videos or programs to your TV, provided you have one of Google’s Chromecast devices. For now, these videos have to come from Google’s own YouTube service, but the company says Netflix and others are coming.

The mics aren’t quite as good as the Echo’s

In my tests, I was able to get all the Saturday Night Live presidential debate parodies to play on my TV using just Google Home and a single voice command. I also used Home to cast rock star music videos, other TV clips and a random YouTube video of a person playing a guitar.

About that guitar video: I saw it due to the fact that the dual long-range mics on the Home simply couldn’t grasp the name of my colleague “Lauren Goode” despite repeated attempts (you should watch her YouTube videos anyway.) So I saw other people. I had a handful of other experiences in which the Google Home mics just couldn’t figure out what I was saying.

At other times they seemed overly sensitive. For instance, if you have two Home units set up, as I did, only the one closest to you is supposed to respond to your voice. I found this generally true, but on two occasions, both units responded. Overall, the mics had very good range and accuracy, even several rooms away, but not quite as good as the 7-mic array on the Amazon product.

If you do spring for multiple Google Home speakers, you can set them up, via the app, to play the same music in multiple rooms. This worked fine for me. Speaking of the app, it works on both Android and iPhone, and I tested both successfully.

Privacy

A lot of people might be suspicious about placing a constantly-listening Google device in their homes, since the company is famous for collecting personal information. I asked Google about this, and a person who worked on Google Home swore that it only collects what you say after it hears the trigger phrases. Further, he said, the data goes into the same data store as other information Google collects about you. And, like that information, you can tweak or even delete it at myactivity.google.com.

Bottom Line

To paraphrase Google’s own CEO, Sundar Pichai, artificial intelligence is still in its very early days. And, in my opinion, Google Home shows that. I have no doubt it will improve. But I was surprised that Google Home arrived so rough around the edges, especially when it had an existing competitive product to learn from, and an unmatched wealth of data to draw upon.

Like a dominating batter in a tight World Series game, you kind of expect Google to hit a game-winning homer. But it merely hit a double, and the contest is still very much on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But with the release of the Google Home, Google's own voice-controlled smart speaker, the Echo is finally getting some serious competition. Google, of course, already knows as much or more about you than Facebook, thanks to your web history, your Gmail metadata and tracking the GPS records on your phone. And now the tech giant is aiming to use that data to out-Alexa Amazon, making the little countertop speaker a friendly face for its search-engine-powered online brain.

Google Home pulls info from your Google account to keep you informed about your calendar appointments, and the traffic on your commute. Home even remembers your previous questions to better answer you in the future. It can also control some of your smart-home gadgets -- albeit a fraction of what Echo can -- along with your TV and speakers if you have Chromecast video or audio streamers.

For now, as a tool meant to entertain and help you, Google Home lands well past competent, but short of greatness. For $130 (about £100 or AU$170) -- significantly less than the cost of an Echo -- it admirably fulfills its duties as an entertainer, an assistant and a smart home controller. But Amazon's assistant Alexa bests Home in the latter two categories.

Simply put: Google Home is not yet ready to dethrone Alexa or the Echo ($180, £150 or about AU$235) as the best always-listening smart home speaker.

But since all of Home's smarts (like Echo's) are online, that balance of power isn't set in stone. Google's Android went from a one-time iPhone wannabe to the world's dominant mobile operating system in just a few short years, and Echo is pretty much the iPhone of the smart home world right now.

In other words: Game on, Alexa.

Your new assistant's first day

The Google Home is on sale for $130 starting tomorrow, November 4. The purchase includes six free months of YouTube Red, the site's premium ad-free service, which normally costs $10 per month. Home's price converts to around £100 and AU$170. At launch, you can only buy Home in the US, with other countries yet to be announced.

Getting started with the Google Home is a lot like onboarding a highly qualified human assistant. After downloading the Google Home app, I was up and running with the speaker in minutes, and initially enthralled with how much it could do. Over the course of the first day, however, my initial enthusiasm faded. As assistants go, the Home shows room for improvement.

Without a doubt, though, the Home's design is excellent. Yes, it bears some resemblance to a canister of Glade air freshener (or Renuzit, if you really want to dial in on Home's doppleganger), but I like the slick, clean look. The customizable bases snap on and off easily, letting you add a splash of color. The top responds well to touch. You can rotate your finger clockwise or counterclockwise to change the volume, tap to start or stop the music you're playing, or long press to give the Home a command without saying the wake words, ""OK Google,"" or ""Hey Google.""

Right now, here's what you can ask the Home to do:

Add items to a shopping list

Check your calendar

Set an alarm

Snooze that alarm

Set a timer

Tell you about the weather

Check traffic for your commute to work

Play the news

Answer a question involving a quick Google search

Perform a calculation

Call an Uber

Play a customized daily briefing including traffic, weather and a news briefing you curate with the app

That list doesn't include what the Home can do as an entertainer or a smart home controller -- more on both in just a bit.

The Home app is easy to use on both iOS and Android and integrates the Home with the conversational Google Assistant. Recently showcased in the company's Pixel phones, the Assistant leverages Google's services to provide personalized results. However, the Google Assistant on the Home can't do everything it can do on your phone. Some of the things the Home can't yet do include:

Remove items or change your shopping list

Add entries to your calendar

Integrate multiple calendars

Give you directions

Send directions to your phone

Create lists other than a shopping list

Set reminders

Interact with email

The Home also endeavors to have a personality. Alexa can be positively charming, and Google follows suit by offering Easter egg responses to statements like ""I am your father."" Google's responses, though, tend to either be bland or way over the top. Much like an assistant who's new on the job, Home's friendly, but it's definitely trying too hard.

Let's talk about privacy

As the Google Home deepens its integrations into every aspect of your life in the service of convenience, the inevitable questions torn from the pages of dystopian science fiction novels become more and more pressing. Is Google listening to me? How safe is my information? How do I weigh privacy against convenience?

With the smart home at the center of recent attacks on the internet, these are worthwhile questions to ask, and the Home probably won't have the answers to assuage all of your worries. That said, Google's saying the right things on this front. The Home only records what you say after you activate it with a tap, or with the wake words -- same as the Echo. You'll see it light up in response to know that it's listening -- same as the Echo. In the Home app, you can look over your search history and delete a specific query or clear the history entirely if you'd like -- same as the Echo. There's also a mute button that stops it from listening for its wake word at all -- again, same as the Echo.

The art of conversation: Google Home vs. Amazon Echo

As for what the Home hears, its far-field microphones listen well -- just be sure to speak clearly if you have a complex command. Most of the time, I talked to the Home without hassle from across the large main room in the CNET Smart Home. The Home heard me from adjacent rooms as well, given clear line of sight, and it even heard me through one wall -- though I do have a booming voice.

For those with more of an indoor voice, or a place larger than a one-bedroom apartment, you might want multiple Homes so you always have one within shouting distance. If multiple Homes hear your command, only the closest one -- the one that hears you best -- will respond. We've now tested this feature with multiple Homes and it works reliably. If you give a command with multiple Home in hearing range, every device that catches the wake words will light up, but only the one that hears you best will respond. Alexa has a similar feature on its Echo devices that also works well.

On occasion, the Home wouldn't respond to commands I know it understands. I'd have to repeat myself and punch up my pronunciation of the consonants. Given how new the Home is, I expected to need patience on occasion. From my experience, the Home's better than the Echo was when it first launched and roughly on par with where Alexa is now. The Home performs admirably when listening for you over music or background noise, again keeping up with -- but not besting -- the Echo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was also obvious that deep Google Assistant integration was going to be a huge benefit over rival handsets.

On the other hand, it was also obvious that in terms of design, the new Pixel and Pixel XL were so familiar that it was almost uncomfortable. In a nutshell, they looked exactly like iPhones, but with a peculiar glass panel slapped on the back. The explanation behind Google’s decision reuse Apple’s iPhone design has been something of a mystery ever since the phones debuted, but now we finally know exactly how it happened.

DON’T MISS: This iPhone 7 video review from a hardcore Android fan is making Android users want to switch

When Google unveiled its new Pixel phones, company executives repeatedly sought to make it clear that these phones were designed solely by Google, inside and out, with no input from the company’s manufacturing partner HTC. This seemed odd, of course, because the Pixel looks suspiciously similar to HTC’s recent iPhone copycats. But hey, Google said that the company did its own thing, so we took Google’s word for it.

As it turns out, HTC apparently wasn’t involved in the design at all, just like Google said.

Google announced the new feature on its blog on Tuesday morning. While Daydream View ($79) and its Harry Potter-themed game Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them aren't available until November, Google's new spells feature is clearly hyping the game and aimed at getting users excited about exploring the Harry Potter world with Google's hardware.

The bug itself is very specific — allowing attackers to escape from security sandboxes through a flaw in the win32k system — but it’s serious enough to be categorized as critical, and according to Google, it’s being actively exploited. As a result, Google went public just 10 days after reporting the bug to Microsoft, before a patch could be coded and deployed. The result is that, while Google has already deployed a fix to protect Chrome users, Windows itself is still vulnerable — and now, everybody knows it.

Google’s disclosure provides only a general description of the bug, giving users enough information to recognize a possible attack without making it too easy for criminals to replicate. Exploiting the bug also depends on a separate exploit in Adobe Flash, for which the company has also released a patch. Still, simply knowing that the bug exists will likely spur a lot of criminals to look for viable ways to exploit it against computers that have yet to update Flash.

First reached by VentureBeat, Microsoft harshly criticized the disclosure. “Today’s disclosure by Google puts customers at potential risk,” a Microsoft spokesperson said. “We recommend customers use Windows 10 and the Microsoft Edge browser for the best protection.”

On Tuesday, Microsoft followed up with more detail in a post by Executive VP Terry Myerson. Myerson attributed the exploitation of the bug to a group called Strontium, a Russia-linked group also called Fancy Bear. Myerson emphasized that Windows 10 users browsing with Edge would be protected from the attack, and promised a system-wide patch to be shipped on November 8th.

The brief grace period is in accordance with a policy Google put in place in 2013, allowing critical vulnerabilities to be disclosed only seven days after they’re reported to the vendor. At the time, a number of researchers criticized the policy as overly harsh, arguing that seven days was not enough time to properly respond to a complex vulnerability. This is the first major invocation of the policy in the three years since it was put in place, although Google’s engineers defended it as necessary given the active exploitation of the bug.

“We encourage users to verify that auto-updaters have already updated Flash — and to manually update if not,” Google’s post recommends, “and to apply Windows patches from Microsoft when they become available.”

In short, Google Brain researchers have discovered that the AI, when properly tasked, create oddly inhuman cryptographic schemes and that they’re better at encrypting than decrypting. The paper, “Learning to protect communications with adversarial neural cryptography,” is available here.

The rules of the task were simple. Two neural networks, Bob and Alice, shared a secret key. Another neural network, Eve, was tasked with reading the communications between the two robots. There was one condition, a “loss function,” for each party. Eve and the recipient Bob’s plaintext had to be as close to the original plaintext as possible while Alice’s loss function depending on how far from random Eve’s guesses were. This created a generative adversarial network among the robots.

Write the researchers Mart?n Abadi and David G. Andersen:

?Informally, the objectives of the participants are as follows. Eve’s goal is simple: to reconstruct P accurately (in other words, to minimize the error between P and PEve). Alice and Bob want to com- municate clearly (to minimize the error between P and PBob), but also to hide their communication from Eve. Note that, in line with modern cryptographic definitions (e.g., (Goldwasser & Micali, 1984)), we do not require that the ciphertext C “look random” to Eve. A ciphertext may even con- tain obvious metadata that identifies it as such. Therefore, it is not a goal for Eve to distinguish C from a random value drawn from some distribution. In this respect, Eve’s objectives contrast with common ones for the adversaries of GANs. On the other hand, one could try to reformulate Eve’s goal in terms of distinguishing the ciphertexts constructed from two different plaintexts.

The methods evolved over time and eventually Bob and Alice were able to communicate clearly using the shared key. Eve, on the other hand, had some luck decrypting the systems until Bob and Alice became proficient and then her ability to crack the cipher failed. Bob and Alice, on the other hand, got really good at sharing encrypted information and many of their techniques were quite odd and unexpected, depending on calculations that weren’t common in “human generated” encryption.

Ultimately the researchers found that Bob and Alice were good at devising a solid encryption protocol on their own as long as they valued security. Eve, on the other hand, had a heck of a time decrypting their communications. This means robots will be able to talk to each other in ways that we – or other robots – won’t be able to crack. I, for one, welcome our robotic cryptographic overlords.

Its founders had envisioned their tool for making 6-second clips as a way to help people capture casual moments in their lives and share them with friends. It was part of their pitch to Twitter, which bought the company for a reported $30 million in October 2012, seeing it as a near-perfect video analog to its flagship app’s short-form text posts.

And yet even before the app launched, users had taken the 6-second constraint as a creative challenge. Something about that loop — the way a Vine endlessly rewound itself after completing, like a GIF with audio — encouraged people to put the app to strange uses. “It was surprising,” said Dom Hofmann, who founded Vine with Rus Yusupov and Colin Kroll four months before Twitter bought it. “Our original beta had something like 10 or 15 people on it, and even with that small group we started to see experimentation pretty early on.”

Within weeks, it appeared that Vine probably would never become the everyday video sharing tool its founders had envisioned. Instead it became something wilder — and much more culturally interesting. “It became pretty clear as soon after we launched,” Hofmann said. “Watching the community and the tool push on each other was exciting and unreal, and almost immediately it became clear that Vine’s culture was going to shift towards creativity and experimentation.”

“It immediately became clear that Vine’s culture was going to shift towards creativity.”

On Thursday, the experimentation came to an end. With its own future increasingly uncertain, Twitter said it would shut down Vine’s mobile app some time in the next few months. And while existing Vines will remain on the web, a media format that had become beloved for its versatility now appears headed the way of Betamax.

Interviews with seven former executives reveal a portrait of a company whose cultural impact far outstripped its strategic benefits to Twitter. Working a continent apart from their parent company, Vine’s small, New York-based team struggled to grow its user base or find ways to make money. While Vine once boasted a commanding lead over other social video apps, it failed to keep pace as competitors added features — something that ultimately drove its biggest stars away. The app generated more beloved memes and cultural moments than most apps with twice as many users — but Twitter’s mounting core business problems this year all but ensured it would eventually be sold off or shuttered.

Ian Padgham saw the potential in Vine — both creative and monetary — before almost anyone. As a member of Twitter’s marketing team in 2012, he was responsible for making videos that explained how the service worked. (His early film about working at Twitter is likely one of the most-watched recruiting videos ever made.) After Twitter bought Vine, he sat in on meetings with the marketing team and began to explore its potential as a creative tool.

Padgham’s first Vine was a simple time-lapse video of the view from his window at Twitter. He loved the 6-second limit, which forced him to think differently about storytelling. “It’s kind of like drawing in Microsoft Paint,” he said. “It used to be the worst app ever, but you couldn’t get distracted by the bells and whistles.”

“You couldn’t get distracted by the bells and whistles.”

Padgham began making Vines every day before he left for work, and they soon grew both in popularity and in ambition. He cut out 300 photo prints and spent three hours painstakingly turning them into a tribute to Eadweard Muybridge, a photographer who did pioneering work in motion pictures. He stood underneath Big Ben and recorded a time lapse of himself appearing to move the hands of the clock with his fingers, a loop that was viewed more than 5 million times. Soon brands like Sony and Airbnb were contacting Padgham asking him to make Vines on their behalf, and six months after Vine launched he quit Twitter to do it full time.

In 2013, Vine began allowing users to record clips with their phones’ front-facing cameras, and usage exploded. An ecosystem of young stars sprung up around the service, which evolved into a kind of live-action cartoon network. There was Zach King, whose eye-popping magic tricks earned him 4 million followers and more than 1.4 billion views. Or Amanda Cerny, whose physical comedy earned more than 2.2 billion views. Logan Paul, whose Vines looped more than 4 billion times, parlayed his following into a series of acting roles — while earning $200,000 to create a single Vine for a brand, according to a recent 60 Minutes report.

In a 2014 look at how video platforms were creating the next generation of celebrities, The New Yorker put Vine at the center. “A Vine’s blink-quick transience, combined with its endless looping, simultaneously squeezes time and stretches it,” Tad Friend wrote. The app generated countless memes, and grew increasingly self-referential over time, so that a single 6-second clip might reference a dozen previous hit Vines. And yet in retrospect it seems clear that 2014 was when Vine peaked. Research firm 7Park Data says 3.64 percent of all Android users opened Vine in August 2014; today that number has fallen to 0.66 percent. (Twitter never said how many people used Vine, but once claimed it had an audience of 200 million people on the web.)

Former executives say that a major competitive challenged emerged in the form of Instagram, which introduced 15-second video clips in June 2013. “Instagram video was the beginning of the end,” one former executive told me. “[Vine] didn’t move fast enough to differentiate.” Instagram courted celebrities with longer videos, eventually bumping the limit to a more flexible 60 seconds. (Vines didn’t break the 6-second barrier until earlier this year, and its extended videos never caught on.) Instagram also began promoting celebrity accounts in its popular “explore” tab, bringing them attention that Vine found difficult to match. Marketers began shifting their money away from Vine, and stars followed.

“Vine didn’t move fast enough to differentiate.”

Meanwhile Snapchat, which allowed users to send each other 10-second video clips and (later) broadcast them publicly, ultimately became the casual mass-market lifecasting app that Vine’s founders had once pitched their product to Twitter as. When other platforms surged ahead, some Vine stars began negotiating to be paid to post on the service. But the talks stalled, and by May the Washington Post found that Vine users with large followings were sharing new videos much less frequently.

At the management level, Vine was rarely stable for long. Hofmann quit in 2014 to pursue a new startup. Kroll followed him out the door later that year. Twitter laid off Yusupov, who was Vine’s creative director, as part of last year’s mass layoffs. (“Don’t sell your company!”, he tweeted on Thursday.) Jason Toff took over Vine in 2014 and led it for two years before quitting this year to work on virtual reality projects at Google. Hannah Donovan became general manager in March after working at a series of music startups. Her lack of previous experience running a company led some employees I spoke with to question whether her hiring might be the beginning of the end.

Years of executive churn likely contributed to Vine’s failure to make money. For a while, brands were happy to pay Vine stars directly to make ads and share them to their millions of followers. But after Snapchat and Instagram grew into hundreds of millions of daily users, marketers’ interest in Vine dropped significantly. They had once longed for ways to grow their own followings on the app — through paid placement offerings similar to Twitter’s promoted tweets and promoted accounts.But Vine never came through with any options, in part because the founders resisted monetization from the start, sources said. It never took a cut of stars’ deals with brands, although Twitter bought a social media talent agency last year in hopes it could begin to do so indirectly.

By this year, Twitter executives were discussing ways to bring Twitter’s various video offerings together somehow, sources said. In June, the company held discussions about absorbing Vine into Twitter’s flagship app. To Vine employees, those discussions served as evidence that Twitter never valued Vine as a standalone property the way its audience did. But no Vine integration ever materialized, and this summer top Vine executives began heading for the exits. Twitter explored selling the app, according to the New York Times, but it never found a buyer.

“Vine didn’t ship anything of consequence for a year.”

“A couple of things plagued Vine, and it all stems from the same thing, which is a lack of unity and leadership on a vision,” said Ankur Thakkar, who was Vine’s head of editorial from 2014 until May of this year. He told me he was proud of the work the app did to highlight rising stars, including Ruth B, who earned a record deal after his team gave her a coveted “editor’s pick” award. But by the end the company was rudderless, he said. “That trickled down into all of the project teams and the things they were working on,” he said. “Vine didn’t ship anything of consequence for a year.”

The stars who grew famous on Vine continue posting their work on other platforms. But they’re no longer pushing the surprisingly elastic boundaries of the 6-second medium. “The most important of part of Vine has always been the people that are on it,” Dom Hofmann told me. “It’s also the only part that can’t be replicated. So I’m going to miss them. Even though I can and do follow some people from Vine on Instagram or Snapchat or Twitter or wherever they’ve decided to go, it just doesn’t feel the same. It’s like the band is breaking up and everyone’s going solo.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Google parent company updated investors on the state of its behemoth advertising business, as well as projects like cloud, phones and internet. Google's quarterly growth reflects strength in mobile search, Google Play and cloud, Porat said.

Google's websites saw sales increase 23 percent to $16.09 billion, above the $15.79 expected by a StreetAccount consensus estimate, while advertising revenues rose 18 percent to $19.82 billion.

Total traffic acquisitions costs were 21 percent of revenues, the same as this quarter last year.

Traffic acquisition costs to Google Network Members rose to $2.62 billion, 70 percent of revenues from Google Network Members. Meanwhile TAC to distribution partners rose to $1.56 billion, 10 percent of Google website revenues.

""We do continue to expect ongoing gross margin pressure from higher TAC associated with mobile search and with programmatic,"" Porat said. ""That does still result in more revenue and more gross profit dollars, but at a lower margin.""



Co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page changed Google's corporate structure last year, creating a collection of companies called Alphabet and naming Sundar Pichai head of Google. The move was praised for adding transparency between core businesses — such as search, Android and YouTube — and its more creative endeavors, ""smaller bets in areas that might seem very speculative or even strange when compared to [Google's] current businesses.""

During the quarter, Google's revenues rose to $22.25 billion, while ""other bets"" revenue rose to $197 million, thanks to Nest, Fiber and Verily, Porat said.

Google is second only to Facebook when it comes to 2016 display ad revenue worldwide, and is the leader of search ad spending, eMarketer estimates. And after search traffic on mobile surpassed desktop last year, ads followed suit, eMarketer estimates.

About 59.5 percent of the company's net global ad revenues will come from mobile internet ads this year, up from about 45.8 percent in 2015, according to eMarketer.



It's no coincidence, then, that Google has introduced new businesses this fall, including a house-designed mobile phone, Pixel. CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted Android's ""open, horizontal, free"" platform, which he said spurs innovation, during a conference call with investors.

""The new devices are not only aimed at diversifying Google revenues but also at enriching Google's advertising targeting capabilities as consumers engage and share information with Pixel, Google Assistant, Daydream View, Chromecast and other Google ecosystem devices,"" eMarketer senior forecasting analyst Martín Utreras said in a statement.



The company has also spent on key hires in priority areas like cloud, and in acquiring YouTube content.Still, the non-Google businesses have reportedly seen some setbacks, with high-profile departures, most recently from Google's fiber unit for high-speed connectivity. Porat highlighted Nest and self-driving cars, and said that they were focusing on Fiber's potential in light of other bets' ""10x opportunities.""

""As we reach for moonshots that will have a big impact in the longer term, it's inevitable that there will be course corrections along the way, and that some efforts will be more successful than others,"" Porat said. ""Over the past year, for example, you've seen us make progress and accelerate our efforts in some areas, while re-positioning or taking a pause in others. We are taking the steps necessary to lay the foundation for a stronger future.""

Google's Class A shares have risen more than 11 percent over the past year, amid a bullish response on Wall Street. Pichai highlighted the company's artificial intelligence vision.

""We are very focused on our core mission, and we see a huge opportunity to do that in a unique way,"" Pichai said. ""Refocusing the companies on the set of initiatives, recognizing that point of inflection, is what has really helped us focus on things … In terms of hardware, in our vision computing is becoming more and more integral, so to really think and evolve it, you need to think about software and hardware together.""

Google was even going to give it equal billing with JavaScript in its Chrome browser. But by the time Dart was ready for prime time, JavaScript — and the massive ecosystem around it — was already miles ahead. About a year and a half ago, Google gave up on the idea of Dart as a direct JavaScript competitor and instead repositioned it as a compile-to-JavaScript language along the lines of TypeScript or CoffeeScript.

Since then, it got rather quiet around Dart. But that’s about to change. Google is hosting a Dart developer conference in Munich this week that marks Dart’s return into the spotlight. Internally, Dart has also been a major success at Google. Both the AdWords and AdSense teams (which drive most of Google’s revenue), as well as the Google Fiber teams, now rely on it to write their consumer-facing web apps. The AdSense update is already live and the next-gen AdWords interface is currently in testing and will launch more broadly in the near future. The Google teams that use it report that it gives them a 25 to 100 percent increase in development speed. Inside of Google, Dart is also now the fastest growing programming language, and the number of lines of Dart code written by Google developers has increased by 3.5x over the course of the last year (though, to be fair, it’s probably starting from a relatively low base, so I would take that “fastest growing” moniker with a grain of salt).

Outside of Google, companies like Wrike, Workiva, Blossom and others have also been using Dart to develop their products, so there is definitely still a Dart user community outside of Google, too.

As Dart co-founder Kasper Lund admitted when I talked to him about Dart’s comeback attempt, the original idea for Dart “may have been too ambitious a start. It was very hard for us to follow that strategy [of building out a Dart runtime in the browser] and target the entire modern web,” he told me. At the same time, though, the team did experience a lot of success with its language and tools without even having the runtime in Chrome. That’s because the team had already built a Dart-to-JavaScript compiler to make sure that the code Dart developers wrote could also run outside of Chrome (even if it would’ve run faster in Chrome).

Having realized that, the team pivoted away from developing a runtime and instead focused all of its energy on the Dart-to-JavaScript compiler and the toolset around it.

Having both the Dart and JavaScript runtime in Chrome actually made it harder for the two languages to interact, Lund tells me. That’s not an issue anymore and the team was able to get rid of all the dependencies it originally built to make that happen. In return, Dart can now more easily work with third-party tools; the one the team has been especially focused on is Angular, Google’s framework for building web and mobile apps.

By default, Angular 2.0 uses Microsoft’s TypeScript as its preferred language. Unsurprisingly, for AngularDart 2.0, which is launching out of beta today, that language is Dart. At its event in Munich this week, the team is also releasing many of the AngularDart Material Design components it developed for its internal teams (think date-picker widgets, etc.) as a developer preview.

As far as the language itself, Dart is getting an optional strong mode that essentially turns Dart into a strongly typed language, as well as generic methods. Google also promises that the compiler can now compile most code to JavaScript in less than a second.

With Flutter, Google is also launching a new project into preview that allows developers to write both iOS and Android apps from a single Dart codebase. Flutter’s widgets use a functional-reactive framework — if that sounds familiar, that’s probably because the overall idea isn’t that different from Facebook’s React Native (something the team freely admits). React Native does have a significant head start, though, but for Google, the overall idea here is to be able to give developers a full Dart toolkit that addresses the majority of use cases.

Given Dart’s popularity inside of Google, Dart is obviously not going away anytime soon. And that’s really the message the company is trying to send this week. Given its history, the team will have to work hard to get outside developers on board, though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When you take something familiar and useful and replace it with content “for you” that you actually didn’t ask for. That’s one of the more visible changes in the latest version of Chrome for Android, which swaps out the bookmarks and recently visited items (above) on the new tab page for “suggested articles.”

I don’t know about you, but I open a lot of new tabs every day, and I appreciated the utility of the old new tab page as much as I dislike the idea of Google constantly guessing at what I might want to read. And while it may be a nice option to opt into, it’s a bit much for Google to just push this content, which for all we know is sponsored, onto every new tab on mobile.

Do you like it? Nice, enjoy! But if not, don’t fret: it’s (relatively) easy to disable, as Android Police reader Matt shows us.

All you need to do is change two hidden settings. Copy each of the links below (you can trust me) and paste them into new tabs. Each will bring up a complicated-looking settings page, with one item highlighted at the top. Tap the little drop-down menu, which probably reads “default,” and select “disabled.”

Don’t touch the other stuff unless you know what you’re doing — some of these are important. It’ll prompt you to restart Chrome after you make these changes — do so and you should be back to the old new tab page.

Even if you aren’t seeing the suggested articles feature yet, you should be able to preemptively disable it this way if you’re on a recent version of Chrome. Just switch things back to “default” if you want to give the feature another go.

Hannah Birch/ProPublica

When Google bought the advertising network DoubleClick in 2007, Google founder Sergey Brin said that privacy would be the company’s “number one priority when we contemplate new kinds of advertising products.”

And, for nearly a decade, Google did in fact keep DoubleClick’s massive database of web-browsing records separate by default from the names and other personally identifiable information Google has collected from Gmail and its other login accounts.

But this summer, Google quietly erased that last privacy line in the sand – literally crossing out the lines in its privacy policy that promised to keep the two pots of data separate by default. In its place, Google substituted new language that says browsing habits “may be” combined with what the company learns from the use Gmail and other tools.

The change is enabled by default for new Google accounts. Existing users were prompted to opt-in to the change this summer.

The practical result of the change is that the DoubleClick ads that follow people around on the web may now be customized to them based on your name and other information Google knows about you. It also means that Google could now, if it wished to, build a complete portrait of a user by name, based on everything they write in email, every website they visit and the searches they conduct.

The move is a sea change for Google and a further blow to the online ad industry’s longstanding contention that web tracking is mostly anonymous. In recent years, Facebook, offline data brokers and others have increasingly sought to combine their troves of web tracking data with people’s real names. But until this summer, Google held the line.

“The fact that DoubleClick data wasn’t being regularly connected to personally identifiable information was a really significant last stand,” said Paul Ohm, faculty director of the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law.

“It was a border wall between being watched everywhere and maintaining a tiny semblance of privacy,” he said. “That wall has just fallen.”

Google spokeswoman Andrea Faville emailed a statement describing Google’s change in privacy policy as an update to adjust to the “smartphone revolution”

“We updated our ads system, and the associated user controls, to match the way people use Google today: across many different devices,” Faville wrote. She added that the change “is 100% optional–if users do not opt-in to these changes, their Google experience will remain unchanged.” (Read Google’s entire statement.)

Existing Google users were prompted to opt-into the new tracking this summer through a request with titles such as “Some new features for your Google account.”

The “new features” received little scrutiny at the time. Wired wrote that it “gives you more granular control over how ads work across devices.” In a personal tech column, the New York Times also described the change as “new controls for the types of advertisements you see around the web.”

Connecting web browsing habits to personally identifiable information has long been controversial.

Privacy advocates raised a ruckus in 1999 when DoubleClick purchased a data broker that assembled people’s names, addresses and offline interests. The merger could have allowed DoubleClick to combine its web browsing information with people’s names. After an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, DoubleClick sold the broker at a loss.

In response to the controversy, the nascent online advertising industry formed the Network Advertising Initiative in 2000 to establish ethical codes. The industry promised to provide consumers with notice when their data was being collected, and options to opt out.

Most online ad tracking remained essentially anonymous for some time after that. When Google bought DoubleClick in 2007, for instance, the company’s privacy policy stated: “DoubleClick’s ad-serving technology will be targeted based only on the non-personally-identifiable information.”

In 2012, Google changed its privacy policy to allow it to share data about users between different Google services - such as Gmail and search. But it kept data from DoubleClick – whose tracking technology is enabled on half of the top 1 million websites – separate.

But the era of social networking has ushered in a new wave of identifiable tracking, in which services such as Facebook and Twitter have been able to track logged-in users when they shared an item from another website.

Two years ago, Facebook announced that it would track its users by name across the Internet when they visit websites containing Facebook buttons such as “Share” and “Like” – even when users don’t click on the button. (Here’s how you can opt out of the targeted ads generated by that tracking).

Offline data brokers also started to merge their mailing lists with online shoppers. “The marriage of online and offline is the ad targeting of the last 10 years on steroids,” said Scott Howe, chief executive of broker firm Acxiom.

To opt-out of Google’s identified tracking, visit the Activity controls on Google’s My Account page, and uncheck the box next to “Include Chrome browsing history and activity from websites and apps that use Google services."" You can also delete past activity from your account.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the wonderful things about the rise of the web, twentysomething years ago, was the way in which it democratized publishing — suddenly, anyone with an idea could set up a website and make it available to anyone. Early on, publishing online required at least a rudimentary understanding of code. To be an online writer meant you also had to be a coder. But, services quickly emerged that created WYSIWYG editors for online publications, so literally anyone who had used a word processor could create online content.

Recently, however, we’ve seen the rise of proprietary formats like Google’s AMP, Facebook’s Instant Articles and the Apple News Format, which threaten to de-democratize publishing on the web. To be clear, I’m not making a philosophical argument about the closed nature of these platforms but something much more practical: Creating content for these formats reintroduces a coding requirement, and online code is vastly more complicated today than it was in the mid-1990s.

A personal history

I first encountered the web when I entered university in 1994. It was a pretty primitive thing back then, with very limited ways to access it, and it was almost entirely text-based. But over the next four years, things moved forward rapidly, with additional web browsers improving the process of browsing the web, and hosting and other online services making it easier for ordinary people like me to set up an online presence. By the time I graduated in 1997, not only was browsing the web a big part of my life, I had a website of my own. In order to build that website, I had to learn HTML, which, at the time, was a very simple thing to grasp, at least at a basic level. But that coding requirement still prevented many people from creating an online presence.

As these platforms — especially AMP and Instant Articles — suck up an ever greater proportion of online content, that’s going to leave smaller publishers out in the cold.

Interestingly, I basically took a two-year break from the web between early 1998 and early 2000 while I was serving as a missionary in Asia. When I returned, the web had again moved on significantly. Blogger had launched in 1999 and was one of the first sites that enabled people to create their own websites without knowing anything about coding, web hosting or any of the other more technical aspects that had previously characterized online publishing. Almost all of my online publishing since has been based on various blogging platforms and, for the last 10 years, almost exclusively on self-hosted WordPress sites.

Along the way, because I’ve always had something of an interest in coding, I’ve beefed up my understanding of HTML, grappled with CSS style sheets, and even done some messing around with PHP. But I’m always enormously grateful I don’t have to try to build sites that would perform well from the ground up — I’ve long since given up on that idea.

Enter AMP, Instant Articles and Apple News

So much for my personal history. Since last summer, we’ve seen what I’d argue is the latest phase in this online publishing evolution. It involves the creation of a variety of proprietary formats for online publishing. Google has been spearheading the Accelerated Mobile Pages project (AMP), which launched officially almost a year ago. Facebook introduced its Instant Articles format last summer, with a similar objective of accelerating the delivery of articles on mobile devices. And Apple introduced News as part of iOS 9, opening it up to publishers over the summer and to most users in the Fall, albeit with different intentions.

Here’s what these platforms have in common, however: Each uses proprietary formats to deliver articles to readers. Technically, these formats use standards-based elements — for example, AMP is a combination of custom HTML, custom JavaScript and caching. But the point here is the outputs from traditional online publishing platforms aren’t compatible with any of these three formats. And in order to publish to these formats directly, you need to know a lot more code than I ever did back in the mid-1990s before the first round of WYSIWYG tools for the web emerged.

We’re effectively turning back the clock to a pre-web world in which the only publishers that mattered were large publishers, and it was all but impossible to be read if you didn’t work for one of them.

As a solution, each of these platforms has provided tools intended to bridge the gap — all three, for example, have WordPress plugins to convert content to the appropriate formats. But a quick read of the reviews for the Facebook and AMP plugins tells you they don’t seem to be doing the job for many users. The Apple News plugin has a higher rating, but I know from my own experience that it’s problematic. Both Facebook and Apple also offer RSS tools to import existing content, but there are limitations around both (Apple News doesn’t allow advertising in RSS-driven publications, while Facebook IA requires a custom RSS feed with IA-specific markup, which is again going to be beyond the ken of most non-coding publishers). Apple news offers a WYSIWYG tool, but it’s extremely basic (it doesn’t support embeds, block quotes, or even bullet points).

Why does all this matter? After all, no one is forcing anyone to use any of these formats — publishing to the open web is still possible. While that’s technically true, at least two of these formats — AMP and Instant Articles — are being favored by the two largest gatekeepers to online content: Google and Facebook. Google now favors AMP results in search, while Facebook does the same within its News Feed, though less explicitly (by favoring faster-loading pages, it gives IA content a leg up). Apple News is different — it’s a self-contained app, and it’s basically irrelevant to you as a publisher unless your readers are using it. But if you do decide to use it, unless you publish in Apple News Format, you can’t monetize your content there, and Apple is pushing the News app heavily to its users.

Turning back the clock

The upshot of all of this is, unless you’re comfortable with fairly advanced web coding, or can pay someone who is, your online publication is likely to become a second-class citizen on each of these new platforms, if it has a presence there at all. And, as these platforms — especially AMP and Instant Articles — suck up an ever greater proportion of online content, that’s going to leave smaller publishers out in the cold.

That in turn means we’re effectively turning back the clock to a pre-web world in which the only publishers that mattered were large publishers, and it was all but impossible to be read if you didn’t work for one of them. That seems like an enormous shame, and from a practical standpoint, matters a lot more to me as an online writer than more philosophical debates about open versus closed platforms.

The travel search engine does everything you assume it would, like locate flights based on your ideal outbound time, inbound time and number of stops. After all, it’s the same technology that powers both KAYAK and Orbitz.

The site also includes a whole host of features that aren’t so easy to imagine, probably because they’re so unimaginably amazing. In some cases, this online tool can beat out any human travel agent. Don’t believe us? Check out these seven tricks below.

1. Get alerts when prices are about to skyrocket.

If you’re using Google Flights on your phone, you may see pop-up notifications that tell you when prices are likely to increase for specific flights. The notifications aren’t available on every route, and you can’t control when they appear, but they’re a handy way to predict how much time you have left to book before prices jump. Pay attention when you see them!

Google

2. Don’t know where to go? Search for a general region, and see a map of specific flight prices.

Just Google “flights to Europe” and click the Flights tab below the search box. A map of the entire continent will pop up, along with prices. You’ll be able to compare how much it would cost to fly to London versus Paris — and you can even filter the options by type of airline, duration of flight and price you’re willing to pay.

Google

3. Or go with “I’m feeling lucky” to let Google plan your dream trip.

What “I’m feeling lucky” does for search, it also does for flights. Click on a map within Google Flights, pick your departure spot, and click the “I’m Feeling Lucky” button to let Google choose a destination based on your search history and what’s popular. You’ll also see a bar graph letting you know when flights will be at their cheapest.

Google

4. Google will tell you which flight is the best bang for your buck.

The “best flights” box tells you which flights are the best combinations of price and speed, so you won’t have to decide whether a layover is a good idea or if a nonstop is worth the extra buck. Google also highlights its top pick in green. It’s like having your very own travel agent say, “If I were you, I’d do this.”

Google

5. It’ll also show you the lowest price for any given day on the calendar.

You can see prices for your trip on every day of the month, with the cheapest days highlighted in green. A bar graph at the bottom lets you know how prices will likely drop or rise over time.

Google

6. Automatically see swaps that save you money.

If you search for a flight that has a similar yet less expensive option, the “tip” bar lets you know how much money you’ll save if you’re willing to fly earlier, later or from a different airport. Then you can weigh the cost and decide!

Google

7. Once you find a potential flight, let Google monitor the price for you.

If you find a flight you like, then hit the “save this itinerary” button and let the Google Now app track its pricing. You can hit the app on your phone to see how prices are changing, and Google will email you if they dip dramatically.

The Google Pixel remains our favorite phone, bar none -- unless you're looking for a bigger screen, in which case we'd recommend its big brother, the Pixel XL.

The Pixel strikes a terrific balance between speed and beauty, ergonomics and straight-up usability. It's the purest vehicle for Android Nougat 7.0, Google's mobile operating system. It's a relatively quick-charger. And it offers the most seamless integration with Google's Daydream View VR headset (though the list of compatible phones continues to grow).

Of course, the Pixel isn't perfect; the rear panel's glass treatment may be an aesthetic misfire for some, and it's vulnerable to cracking. It's also not as water-resistant as others, and though its camera is superb, the iPhone 7 Plus delivers superior video quality in portrait mode (read more about how the two stack up). Still, these are mostly minor quibbles; if you're looking for an alternative to the latest model iPhones, the Google Pixel and Pixel XL are worth a serious look.

Looking ahead, Google hasn't officially stated anything yet about the future of the Pixel line, but there are rumors swirling about innovative AR and VR developments and, possibly, a foldable display. But with the next Pixel not expected before October 2017 (a year after the original debuted), Android fans may be tempted by the Samsung Galaxy S8, which is rumored to be hitting in March or April.

Editors' note, February 16, 2017: The original Google Pixel review, first published in October 2016, follows.

With the Pixel, Google stepped up to bat, called its shot, and knocked it out of the park. If there was any lingering doubt about Google's capacity to step out on its own, it's gone. Sure, HTC may have put the phones together, but Google designed, engineered, and branded them. And the timing couldn't be more fortunate with Samsung still emerging from the hangover of a very difficult 2016.

Starting at $649 in the US, £599 in the UK and AU$1,079 in Australia, the Pixel is fast, with an elevated, smooth design. Heavy investments in its camera resulted in a nimble shooter too. Though its special portrait mode is poor, it otherwise takes amazing shots that rival those of the Apple iPhone 7 Plus.

It's also the first phone to have the search giant's new, thoroughly robust voice-and-search service, called Google Assistant, built in. It's the most natural voice assistant I've experienced, and comes closest to giving me that Jarvis from ""Iron Man"" experience all these assistants appear to be chasing.

The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge may still be the most visually striking phone on the market. But, if you're wary of Samsung phones, the Pixel -- a strong contender for the best premium Android phone -- makes a terrific alternative.

Why the Pixel is one of the best Android phones right now

So what's so great about the Pixel? Aside from the premium hardware, like the camera and processor, it packs new software features that are handy to use day-to-day. Read on to find out more.

The camera is (mostly) awesome

As you can tell from its name, Google makes a big deal about the Pixel's camera, and it is superb. It takes even better shots than the already stellar iPhone 7 Plus, which I consider to be the reigning champion of camera phones. If you want the full scoop on how these two compare, check out CNET's feature, Google Pixel vs. iPhone 7 Plus: Which camera is better?

The camera is fast, images are in focus, and colors look vibrant. Close-up shots appear especially sharp and refined. Landscape scenes retain an impressive amount of detail and depth, even with objects that are far away.

Photos taken in dim lighting understandably weren't as sharp and had more digital artifacts. But the camera did a good job at capturing available light and brightening up scenes. The flash made skin tones look natural as well, and if it hadn't been for a few reflections in eyes, it would've been hard to tell in the photos that it was even used.

The front-facing camera is excellent, too. It has a wide enough lens to fit a lot of content (read: faces) in each frame, and it softened skin tones enough to look appealing without appearing too airbrushed. To see the images I captured, check out the slideshow below.

The camera can shoot 4K video, and though it doesn't have optical image stabilization, it uses a combination of the gyroscope and software to steady your videos all the same. This feature works well, and it's useful when you're moving while recording footage. But it does give your videos a sort of surreal, almost drone-like quality.

Google Assistant helps organize your day

The Pixel is deeply integrated with Google's search services, and it's the first hardware device to have Google Assistant baked in. Assistant is an AI bot that uses machine learning and Google's vast search database to answer all kinds of questions you throw its way. It can schedule reminders, look up facts and places to eat, set alarms, give directions, translate phrases and more. And the more you use it, the more it's supposed to learn about you and become more personalized.

Unlike Google Now (the company's previous iteration of a digital assistant), Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa and Microsoft's Cortana, Assistant is genuinely conversational. You can use your voice to speak to it in a natural, back-and-forth way, and it has a chat-like interface. After every interaction, there are suggested follow-up queries you can tap on to keep the conversation going.

Like with most voice assistants, you forget that they're there. But when you do remember, Assistant can be useful. It doesn't hear every question correctly every time, but when it does, it works relatively quickly. Compared to Siri, which sort of checks out after it finishes each task, Assistant builds upon my previous queries, so it made me interact with it longer.

Android Nougat packs some sweetness

The device runs a pure version of Android 7.1 Nougat. It's the first to have Google's messaging service Allo Duo

Launcher shortcuts, aka Google's take on Apple's 3D Touch

You can send GIFs inside Google Keyboard, for all your GIF-fy delights.

To reduce eye strain from viewing a bright, bluish display at night, there's a Night Light setting that tints the screen yellow. (Other Android phones and the iPhone already do this.)

On the back is a fingerprint reader for added user security and services such as Android Pay. It works quickly, and as a bonus you can use it to slide down notifications on the screen.

It looks and feels great

The Pixel and Pixel XL are nearly identical, but the latter has a bigger, sharper display and a bumped-up battery. Other than that, they're pretty much the same. Both are polished and well crafted, and their sleek, one-piece aluminum design make them more elegant than previous Nexus devices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At long last, almost eight years to the day the first Android phone went on sale, Google is launching a smartphone for which it designed the hardware, software, and cloud ecosystem itself: the Pixel. No longer will the tech giant be entirely dependent on other companies to present Android in its best light, in hardware that varied wildly but never was built from the ground up to be the best physical instantiation of pure, Google Android.

I wrote last year and last week about why it makes sense for Google to become, like Apple, a vertically integrated hardware maker. I believe this is the right move. I believe it will shake up the industry. But the question is: how did Google do? How good is the Pixel?

the Pixel is very, very good

After testing the historic phone since last week, I can say that the Pixel is very, very good. In its first try, Google has landed itself in the same class as Apple’s iPhone and the Samsung Galaxy S7 (that company’s non-exploding model). Like those formidable competitors, it’s comfortable and practical; fast and fluid; takes very good pictures; and is connected to a strong ecosystem.

The Pixel is easily the best Android phone I’ve ever tested, and seems to hail from a different planet than the chunky, clumsy and pokey 2008 G1 which introduced Android to the world.

My biggest disappointment with the expensive phone is that its battery life didn’t measure up to Google’s claims in my tests. It wasn’t terrible, but it wasn’t terrific. It also isn’t water resistant, and is exclusive to only a single carrier, Verizon.

My biggest pleasant surprise with the Pixel was the built-in Google Assistant, the company’s artificial intelligent assistant, which, while not perfect, was impressive and far better than Apple’s Siri. My overwhelmingly positive results with the Assistant, which is debuting as a built-in feature on the Pixel, matter a lot. That’s because Google is building the Pixel and other hardware precisely so it can showcase and refine its artificial intelligence work.

Design

The Pixel comes in two models, with identical top-of-the-line specs and excellent cameras: a 5-inch model and a 5.5-inch model, the Pixel XL. These are premium phones, priced in iPhone territory. They start at $649 for a base, 32GB Pixel and top out at $869 for a 128GB XL model.

Almost everyone I showed it to thought it was an iPhone

Which makes it surprising that the design is… conservative. And, by conservative, I mean that, from the front, the Pixel pretty much looks like an iPhone, complete with the big top and bottom bezels or chins that I am hoping Apple eliminates next year. Almost everyone I showed it to just shrugged and thought it was an iPhone. Only those who took a minute for closer examination noticed the absence of a bottom physical home button, and the different arrangement of the side buttons.

The back of the Pixel is very different from the iPhone’s, because there’s a glass rectangle at the top on which Google has placed a large round fingerprint sensor, instead of where Apple has it, on the front. The Pixel also lacks a camera bump, because it’s slightly thicker at the top.

It’s a pleasant, familiar design that feels good in the hand. But it isn’t an attempt to show off any design or hardware chops and it gives Apple a break in a year when the new iPhone has the same body for a third year in a row.

Using it

I slipped right into using the Pixel with ease, even though my main phone is an iPhone. I still find Android just a bit geekier than iOS, but the gap has narrowed greatly and Google’s special version of Android 7.0 Nougat on the Pixel is fast and fluid. There’s no distracting layer of junkware and hosts of duplicate apps, as on third-party Android phones. On the Pixel, you just slide up to see all your apps, besides the ones you’ve placed on the home screens. You slide down for quick settings.

Google’s special version of Android is fast and fluid

And there’s even a feature sort of like Apple’s 3D Touch on the Pixel: a long-press on some icons will bring up quick actions. For instance, press on the camera icon for shortcuts to taking a selfie or a video.

I installed and used third-party apps, including Facebook, Twitter, Slack, and Apple Music. All worked fine, but several seemed behind, or less slick, than their iOS counterparts. For instance, it’s much easier in Slack for iOS to find your history of direct messages.

I tested the Pixel with my car’s Bluetooth, which was smooth as silk. It even worked fine with Apple’s pre-production AirPod earphones, although without any of their special iOS pairing features. I also tested Android Pay on the Pixel at Walgreen’s and Starbucks and it worked fine.

Speaking of earbuds, there’s good and bad news. The good: Google retained the industry-standard 3.5mm headphone jack. The bad: it doesn’t supply any earbuds for a $649 phone. The company says it assumes everyone has many pairs of buds lying around. I wound up using an old Samsung pair.

The Assistant

The Pixel was built to showcase Google’s new artificial intelligence feature, the Google Assistant. It’s the only phone so far on which you can call up this new feature by just pressing the home button or saying ""OK Google.""

The Assistant appears in a text or chat format, because it’s meant to carry on a conversation with you. (You can also use it in the new, optional Google messaging app, Allo.)

Google warns that the Assistant is just in its earliest days, and still missing a lot of smarts and capabilities. For instance, it can’t read your emails and texts. It can’t book you a flight. And when I asked it for the ingredients for apple pie, it failed to list apples — though a more complete list appeared if I tapped on a web link it presented.

the Assistant shredded Siri

Having said that, the Assistant blew away every competitor I’ve tried. It shredded Siri, which has a five-year lead. It not only did on-phone tasks reliably — like launching an app, or creating reminders or notes or playing music — but it understood most of the wider-world questions I asked it. Even more impressively, it remembered the general subject I was asking about, so I didn’t have to repeat the topic with every question.

Here’s a series of questions I asked about the state where I live, without ever saying the state’s name except in the first question. The Assistant answered every question but one with a vocal reply, and answered all quickly and accurately:

— What’s the population of Maryland?

— Who’s the governor?

— What’s the average household income?

— What’s the land area?

— Show me the state flag.

— What’s the biggest county?

I’m pretty sure I could have gone on. When I tried this with Siri, it handled the first one nicely, vocally and with a Wikipedia page. It answered the second by displaying an article defining the term governor.

For all of its other qualities, the Pixel is worth considering just for the Assistant.

Camera

In good light, I found that the camera took very pleasing, vivid photos with colors that popped — an effect enhanced by the phone’s OLED screen. I liked them, and you may as well. But sometimes, the Pixel’s photos seemed too saturated. For instance, a Pixel photo of flowers in my garden that are a bit past their peak looked unnaturally colorful on the Pixel’s screen, even though I liked the effect. They looked more realistic in an iPhone 7 shot viewed on the iPhone 7 screen. When viewed side by side on a non-OLED laptop screen, they looked nearly identical. Your preference will be a matter of personal taste. The camera on the Pixel also lacks optical image stabilization, unlike on the iPhone. Videos I took walking around my neighborhood weren’t too shaky, though.

In dim light, however, I found the iPhone 7 did much better than the Pixel. Some combination of its wider lens aperture and flash gave it the edge, and objects were clearer.

Having said all that, the Pixel has a very good camera that should please almost every user in almost every situation.

Battery life

It’s tough to measure battery life on a smartphone, because it depends too much on a wide variety of factors, including what features and apps a person used, for how long each, and how far the phone was from good cellular and Wi-Fi connections. However, in my short few days of testing, using the smaller Pixel, I never approached the 13 hours or so Google claimed for most activities. On a day when I was focused on battery life, streaming a 90-minute movie and playing music for hours, I got only a few minutes over nine hours — not even enough to get most people through a full work day, including commutes. As I write this, having played little music and streamed no video today, the phone is predicting I’ll get 12 hours. For comparison, in my typical usage patterns, and in the same areas and phone network, the iPhone 7 got between 12 and 14 hours.

Google couldn’t explain my results, and I must note that a colleague doing his own review had a much better battery life experience with the Pixel.

Support

Google has no experience supporting consumers who bought hardware. It's promising online and phone support ""day or night."" From right on the phone. I didn’t test this, but, even if it’s good, it’s not the same as getting human help at hundreds of Apple Stores around the world.

Bottom line

If you’re an Android fan, willing to buy a premium phone, the Pixel is your answer. To repeat: it’s simply the best Android phone I’ve tested. If you’re an iPhone user thinking of switching, the Pixel will seem physically familiar, but you’ll have to overcome the sticky links you’ve developed with fellow iPhone users, things like iMessage (which Google can’t match yet) and iCloud Photo Sharing (which Google is trying to copy). You’ll also have to do without the comfort of your neighborhood Genius Bar.

the best Android phone I’ve tested

But my main message, dear readers, is this: Google has come out of the gate with a top-flight phone and suddenly, there’s no longer an Apple-Samsung duopoly in premium handsets.

Google Pixel phone review",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10/14/2016,0.396779702,0.061153515,781.65,783.95,776,778.53,852487,7.95,-3.12,0,"Earlier this year, Steve McCarroll announced that his team had discovered the gene that most powerfully drives our risk of schizophrenia. Known as C4, it was previously viewed as an immune-system gene, but clearly, it also does something in the brain. To work out what, McCarroll first needed to know which cells in the brain activate C4. Easier said than done: “There’s no place for looking that up,” he says. Instead, his team had to examine slices from over 700 postmortem brains, and stain them with a dozen different-colored antibodies that recognize C4. “The slices were variable in quality. The antibodies were variable in quality. It took us almost a year to get satisfying answers. It was a slog.” McCarroll’s lament is a common one. Geneticists are constantly learning about genes that influence our risk of disease, but genes don’t perform in a vacuum. They perform in our cells. And since the 30 trillion cells in your body all share the same genes, you need to know which cells are actually using the gene in question. Where are those cells? What do they do normally, and what goes wrong in cases of disease? And in most cases, without the kind of slog that McCarroll endured, the answers are: we don’t know; no idea; and, ¯\_(?)_/¯.

Without such answers, a lot of the hype around biomedical advances becomes wishful thinking. With stem cells, scientists hope to re-grow damaged or lost tissues, but how do we regenerate something when we don’t entirely know what it’s composed of? With gene-editing techniques like CRISPR, we will supposedly hack diseases out of our DNA, but without deep knowledge of our cells, how do we know what to edit? Our cells are the basic unit of our bodies—the stage upon which our genes enact their dramas. And simply put, “we really don’t know our cells.” says Aviv Regev from the Broad Institute. “And so we don’t know ourselves.” Consider this fairly basic question: How many types of cells are there in the body? Around 200, according to several introductory pages from the National Institutes of Health. That figure corresponds to major groups, like neurons, heart cells, muscle cells, and more. But if you ask an immunologist, they’ll tell you there are at least 200 types of immune cells alone. Ask an immunologist who specializes in T-cells, and they’ll tell you there are at least 200 of those. When I met Regev last year, she spent a good 15 minutes talking about all the variations within our cells. There are subtypes upon subtypes upon subtypes, she said. The retina alone contains at least 100 different classes of neurons. To complicate matters, some types of cells can transform into others. And each subtype can exist in many different states based on its environment, its neighbors, its position in a tissue, and the molecules it encounters.

""All of these things, the type and the subtype, the states, the locations, and the transitions … you’d want to know all of them,"" Regev told me. She let her words hang, and she smiled gently. Because she had a plan to do exactly that: to know everything. Over the last few years, Regev has been slowly laying the foundations for compiling a Human Cell Atlas—a complete portrait of our cells in all their staggering diversity. It would list every subtype, how they change over time, where they are found, and which genes they switch on. Much like the first fully-sequenced human genome, it would be a resource so fundamental that biologists will use it many times a day without even thinking about it—a comprehensive, searchable Google Maps for the human body. Creating such a resource is ambitious to say the least, and would have seemed impossible just five years ago. But thanks to technological advances, Regev and others think that the time is right. “The idea has been bubbling,” says Sarah Teichmann from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. “I had talked with someone about this four years ago. At the time, it seemed a bit crazy. Even now, it seems crazy—but also more feasible. And people are willing to consider it.” That’s partly due to Regev, who has been evangelizing for the atlas since 2014. She is widely respected, and not just for her boundless energy and fierce intellect. “She’s one of the smartest people I’ve ever met, but also intense, perceptive, compassionate and caring,” says Dana Pe’er from Columbia University.

Case in point: Last June, at a meeting, Regev noticed that Pe’er was suffering from back pain, surreptitiously emailed her to ask if she was okay, and texted a colleague to bring in a more comfortable chair—all while leading a debate between big-name scientists and summarizing their discussion in real time. “The people sitting right next to me didn’t notice a thing,” says Pe’er. “Aviv did, from the other side of the room with a bad field of view.” Yesterday, in London, Regev and Teichmann convened another meeting of like-minded scientists who were interested in their vision of a cell atlas. The event was effectively a soft launch—not of the atlas itself, but of a budding community that will actually start making it happen. They already have a funding commitment from the Chan-Zuckeberg Initiative—the recently formed company that is aiming to “cure, prevent or manage all disease by the end of this century.” “The Human Cell Atlas would be a transformative technology that advances all of science,” CZI President Cori Bargmann told the assembled researchers. “We’re pretty much on board with saying that this should happen, and we want to help make it happen with the people in this room.” “It was as if we thought that everyone in a city wore green shirts, and it turned out that some wore blue and some wore yellow.” As is often the way in science, Regev’s dream for the Human Cell Atlas began with a simple surprise.

When scientists study cells, they typically smoosh a large population of them together. They get a clear portrait of an average cell, but they whitewash all the diversity within the group. To unveil that diversity, Regev and others had been developing hardware and software for studying single cells. She first turned those tools onto a group of immune cells called dendritic cells back in 2012, isolating just 18 of these cells and cataloguing all the genes that they were activating. “We were immediately astounded,” she says. It turned out that 3 of those 18 cells were switching on very different sets of genes than the others. What was supposedly a pure sample of identical cells turned out to be a pool of two distinct types. “It was as if we thought that everyone in a city wore green shirts, and it turned out that some wore blue and some wore yellow.” She repeated the study with over 1,700 dendritic cells, and found even more variation. Dendritic cells are watchmen: they grab molecules that could be signs of infectious threats, and present those molecules to the rest of the immune system for inspection. But in response to the same molecules, seemingly identical cells would react by switching on different genes. Some did so much earlier than others, and then instigated the responses of their more apathetic neighbors. These experiments showed Regev how much she and other scientists were missing. “All of these years, when we did these studies, we would grow millions of cells in a dish and pretend they were one,” she says. “We’d take these average measurements and say: A cell! We knew that wasn’t correct, but you work with what you have.”

But technology has changed, in both power and affordability. It cost Regev thousands of dollars to analyze just those 18 dendritic cells in 2012. By 2013, with some robotics, she had taken the price down to ten bucks a cell. McCarroll, who also works at the Broad Institute, pushed the cost down even further. He and his team developed a technique called DropSeq, which sends cells down extremely narrow canals, single file, and incarcerates them in droplets of oil. Each oily cage is a millionth of a milliliter in volume, and contains precisely one prisoner. Once in solitary confinement, the cells can be split open and their DNA can be sequenced. So can their RNA—a related molecule that reveals which genes are being switched on. With DropSeq, Regev and McCarroll can simultaneously study hundreds of thousands of single cells, at just 6 cents each. They can start doing the work it would take to actually build a Human Cell Atlas in a cost-effective way. “Aviv has been pushing the cutting edge to do things that almost seem impossible, and she's made unbelievable ground in a very short period of time,” adds Pe’er. “I didn't think it could be done that fast.” “At first people will say it’s impossible. Later, they’ll say it was obvious.” The Human Cell Atlas isn't just an academic cataloguing exercise. It might be the key to making the promises of biomedicine real. When geneticists identify genes behind diseases, they want to understand where those genes are active. When immunologists engineer cells to attack cancers based on the molecules on their surface, they'd better know whether healthy cells somewhere in the body naturally harbor those same molecules. And when tissue engineers dream of growing new organs in a lab, they need to know if what they're producing actually matches their natural counterparts.

The Human Cell Atlas isn’t going to reveal everything about our bodies, just as the Human Genome Project didn’t tell us everything about our genes. But it should provide a foundational resource—something that spurs countless future experiments and makes those experiments easier. “Think of what having the genome has done for biology: We can find genes that cause disease, and sequence tumors, and personalize medicine,” says Pe’er. “I think the Human Cell Atlas would have the same impact. And we need it to make sense of our genome.” It might also help scientists to make more use of finished research. Researchers have already sequenced the DNA of countless tissue samples, taken from people with cancer and all kinds of other conditions. Regev can look at those sequences and, with a few computational tricks, reverse-engineer which types of cells were present. She has already tried this with melanoma skin cancers. “We can say this tumor pretty much only had malignant cells, or this one had a lot of immune cells,” she says. “There’s so much hidden there that we don’t yet know.” That might help cancer biologists to better classify tumors into distinct types, and develop more effective tailor treatments—all without collecting anything new. “These samples come from people who had diseases,” she adds. “We owe them and the taxpayers to learn the maximum amount we can.” Skeptics might argue that tech aside, the Human Cell Atlas is still implausible. The Human Genome Project had an obvious endpoint—produce a near-complete genome. But cataloguing our cells seems like fighting a Hydra—find one subtype and two more rise to take its place. Regev thinks otherwise. “Is every cell going to be its own special snowflake? I would say not,” she says. “They group into stable categories.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ""fact check"" label will now appear in expanded story boxes on the Google News website and mobile apps, alongside other labels such as ""opinion"" and ""highly cited.""

This could be an important step for Google’s YouTube, where monetization has been a big concern — not just for YouTube as a whole, but also for individual creators. YouTube has been working to provide more support on this front through its partner program, but we’ve also seen the growth of multi-channel networks that creators join up with for ad sales and business resources.

By acquiring FameBit, YouTube might look like it’s getting more competitive with those MCNs, but in a blog post, YouTube’s Ariel Bardin said that’s not the case:

FameBit was backed by Los Angeles startup studio Science, Inc. When I spoke to FameBit CEO David Kierzkowski last year, he said the marketplace is focused on “long- and mid-tail creators,” not just the big YouTube stars who get most of the attention from MCNs.

For the longest time, Google used Panoramio to augment its Google Maps and Google Earth services with crowdsourced imagery. Now that the company has integrated photo uploads into the Google Maps mobile apps and launched its Local Guides program, Panoramio clearly isn’t a priority for the company anymore.

Google previously tried to shut the service down in 2014. At the time, its users successfully petitioned the company to keep it open, but this time around, the decision seems to be final.

“Today, with photo upload tools in Google Maps and our Local Guides program, we are providing easy options for you to share your photos with an active and growing community,” Google wrote in an email to Panoramio users today. “As such, we’ve decided to now close down Panoramio.”

Last year, when Google decided to keep the service going beyond its original closing date, the company said that it would go “back to the drawing board to work on a more integrated solution that supports you and your content directly within Google Maps.” Today, Google is encouraging active Panoramio users to join its Local Guides program and to upload photos directly to Google Maps.

For users who have linked their Panoramio and Google+ accounts, Google will automatically copy their images to a Google Album archive (that’s Google service for downloading copies of images from all of its services). Users will also still be able to access their photos in Panoramio for a year after November 4.

Unsurprisingly, Panoramio’s users aren’t impressed, but today’s incarnation of Google/Alphabet isn’t shy about shutting down services that have outlived their usefulness.

But Apple caps its free iCloud storage tier at a paltry 5GB — capacity that’s quickly filled with Live Photos, iOS app data, 4k video, GIFs everyone’s sending you in the new iMessages; and critically, iOS device backups. So in reality, Apple’s apps are not free — Apple charges you for them indirectly by requiring you to purchase more and more storage over time.

Some call this approach cheeky, but I'd call it deceptive in 2016. Apple sells you on a premium experience that’s undercut by the menial reality of its storage plans. It’s like buying a Rolex and then being required to buy a plastic bag just to carry it out of the store.

Apple likes touting its new iCloud Drive sync feature that makes all your desktop files accessible from your Macs and iOS devices. Apple even asks you to enable it when upgrading to Sierra. Trouble is, my desktop, like yours perhaps, is my workspace, containing hundreds of screenshots, drafts, photos, and videos. I have so many files on my iMac’s desktop that Sierra prompted me to purchase more storage during installation. ""Ugh!"" I thought, feeling like a dolt for believing my free OS upgrade wouldn't cost anything. I decided not to pay so I'm currently not able to use this feature.

I don’t mind paying for storage as long as it’s reasonably priced, but Apple’s 1TB pricing is not reasonable, especially when the iPhone’s camera is a major selling point and iCloud Photos is the culprit maxing out everyone's storage plans.

Apple charges $9.99 per month for 1TB of iCloud storage, or roughly $120 per year. Compare that to Amazon, where for $4.99 per month you get unlimited storage. Hell, Amazon Prime subscribers ($99 per year) get free unlimited photo storage as just one of many membership perks. Microsoft’s 1TB OneDrive plan costs only $6.99 per month and you get full access to the Office 365 suite of apps.

Google is doing exactly what Apple should be doing

Google, meanwhile, is doing exactly what Apple should be doing. People who buy Google’s new Pixel phones are given free unlimited Google Photos storage to host all their original photographs and 4k video. For Google it’s a fair trade, it gets to scrub your photos for anonymous data that will ultimately help it sell better ads, and Pixel owners never have to worry about seeing a ""storage is full"" message when uploading their imagery. Apple’s not making money from ads like Google, but it definitely wants the world to think iPhone when deciding what camera to buy next.

Dropbox comes close to Apple’s exorbitant pricing model but Dropbox is in the business of selling cloud storage. Even then, 1TB Dropbox Pro subscriptions cost $99.99 per year. Just think about that for a second; Apple charges more than Dropbox even though iCloud storage is a fundamental requirement for the features Apple promotes to help drive hardware sales. And in case it wasn’t obvious to you by now, Apple still makes its money by selling hardware.

Pricing limits the overall Apple experience

It’s bad enough that iCloud’s storage pricing hurts Apple’s most loyal customers — people who want to synchronize their data across multiple iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS devices and then share it with like-minded friends and family. But the pricing also inhibits new customers from experiencing Apple devices to their fullest potential because the owners are reluctant to pay for something they were told was free.

In fairness, Apple has been lowering its iCloud Storage rates over the years. Apple introduced the 1TB tier in September of 2014 for $19.99 per month which dropped to the current $9.99 rate in September of 2015. September 2016 has come and gone and all we got was a new $19.99 2TB tier. In other words, there's no reason to expect a discount anytime soon.

Am I mad enough about my storage predicament to buy a new Pixel? No. But that new Google Home AI assistant sure looks appealing and it’s priced about the same as an annual 1TB iCloud storage subscription. And Google Home’s a gateway drug if I’ve ever seen one, that would certainly lead me to buy a Chromecast Ultra, and then a Google TV, and probably a Google Wifi, and then an Android…

The company is set to unveil a slew of new hardware at an event in San Francisco today, and we'll be there (in person and via the power of blogging) to bring you all the news you need.

If you've not heard anything about what to expect, well, congratulations for managing to stay off the internet for such a long time! Today's big ticket items have already been so thoroughly leaked they're practically dripping on the floor, but the main focus will undoubtedly be a pair of new smartphones dubbed the Pixel and Pixel XL.

These phones are expected to be identical apart from their size, with the Pixel coming with a 5-inch display and the Pixel XL boosting that to 5.5 inches. We're expecting a standard slate of specs, including the new Snapdragon 821 processor, 4GB of RAM, fingerprint readers, and large batteries. Leaked images suggest the Pixels are iPhone-lookalikes, although they are being billed as ""made by Google,"" so expect the company to emphasize how it's left its mark on the devices' software.

As well as phones, we're expecting a new Google Chromecast, with reports suggesting the company will unveil an updated device named the Chromecast Ultra, offering 4K and HDR support for $69. We could also see a new Google Wi-Fi router (separate to the company's OnHub platform), and we'll almost certainly hear more about Google Home— the company's rival to the Amazon Echo, which was unveiled at Google I/O back in May.

So! Expect lots of new products to play with, with our team on the ground ready to poke and fiddle with whatever Google unveils. And will there be any surprises in store? Well, it's tricky to say, as the above list of devices already represents a pretty full bill. The only way to find out for sure is to watch yourself:

Google reveals the Pixel phone",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10/4/2016,0.421522195,0.091260608,776.03,778.71,772.89,776.43,1201350,5.82,0.4,1,"Google’s had a busy day. It unveiled two smartphones, launched a connected speaker, introduced a VR headset, announced a fancy router, and debut a new Chromecast all in one fast-moving hour-and-a-half event.

But throughout all of those flashy hardware announcements were details about a software feature that Google seems to think will ultimately be more important: the Google Assistant.

The Google Assistant is, at its core, just a new way to make Google searches, but in a conversation with an AI that knows a lot about you. It's sort of like a mashup of Siri and a chatbot: you can ask it questions aloud or by typing, and it'll try to pull in whatever you're looking for, be it the solution to a math problem, directions to a store, or instructions on getting something done.

Each instance of the Google Assistant works and is used a bit differently

It’s also a little bit more than that — the Google Assistant is supposed to be an assistant, after all. So in some cases, it can figure out what song you’re looking for, present your schedule for the day, and make restaurant reservations for you.

But nailing down exactly what the Google Assistant is capable of can be strangely difficult right now. That's because Google currently has three different ways to use the Google Assistant. Google says it’s the same Assistant in each place, but it can (and can’t) do different things depending on where you use it.

Google Assistant on Google Home (the new speaker) Google Assistant on Pixel (the new phones) Google Assistant on Allo (the new-ish chat app)

Google Assistant has the same goal in each location — get you information and perform basic tasks. But it accomplishes that goal in different ways. And in some limited instances, can only accomplish certain tasks on certain devices.

Here's the breakdown of how the Assistant works on each device, based on what we know so far:

Assistant on Home: This is basically Google's twist on what Amazon is doing with Alexa. You ask questions aloud, and the Assistant reads answers back through the speaker. It can also set alarms, play music, and pull up videos on your TV. Notably, this is the only version of the Google Assistant capable of controlling smart home gadgets, like Nest devices and Philips Hue lights. It’s also the one place Assistant can present your daily schedule.

It’s also the one place Assistant can present your daily schedule. Assistant on Pixel: This is just like Siri. You hold the home button, and the Assistant will pop up waiting to be asked a question. For whatever reason, you can't type in your questions — you have to ask them aloud, and answers will be read back to you. This version of the Assistant has some amount of control over the phone, so you can use it to set reminders, play YouTube videos, and send messages. It can also look up information that's currently being displayed on the phone's screen, essentially replacing Now on Tap.

It can also look up information that's currently being displayed on the phone's screen, essentially replacing Now on Tap. Assistant on Allo: This is kind of like Google as a chatbot. In fact, the Assistant is a chatbot inside of Allo (which itself is a chat app). You type in questions, and it'll fetch answers and drop them back into your chat screen. But you can't ask questions aloud, and you can't control the phone this way.

Google is almost certainly going to combine the different forms of its Assistant eventually so that they're all more-or-less equal in terms of features (save for, you know, stuff like screen search on a speaker). But for now, it’ll be occasionally limiting of what you can do.

And if you’re wondering how Google Now factors into all of this, well, join the club. Google says some of the stuff in Now that makes sense to be in an assistant will migrate over there — but how and when that will happen is anyone’s guess.

In practice, the inconsistencies aren’t a huge deal

These inconsistencies may be part of why Google is keeping Assistant exclusive to just a few of its own products for the time being. It's a core feature of those products, but it's still in early stages, with mixed up features and ways to use it.

So far in what we’ve tried, that confusion isn’t really a big deal. You ask Google a question, it usually manages to answer it, and you move on. It’s only at the edge cases where things can break down a bit, and overall we get the sense that the Google Assistant will be smarter and more flexible than the competition.

Already, Google is talking about the big plans it has to expand Assistant, by allowing other companies to integrate their own services. It’s currently working with Uber, Spotify, Samsung’s SmartThings, and CNN, among many others, and Google says it’ll open up Assistant to everyone later this year.

Then, next year, Google plans to allow other companies to begin putting its Assistant into their own hardware products. It’s an odd thing to hold off on — it’s a software feature, after all — but it suggests that the Assistant is meant to become ubiquitous across Android phones and likely anything else that Google touches. By the time that happens, it ought to be capable of doing quite a bit more.

Google Home first look",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10/4/2016,0.441113636,0.091861472,776.03,778.71,772.89,776.43,1201350,5.82,0.4,1,"I have an Amazon Echo at home, and it's the one high-tech gadget my wife and I share. We often take turns asking it questions and giving it commands during a busy breakfast. There isn't anything particularly personal about the way we interact with Amazon that makes this a struggle, but the device can only be linked to a single account when connecting to something like Google Calendar or Spotify. This can be a pain point when, for example, my wife wants to ask for a Spotify playlist for her account, which isn't linked to our Echo.

Today Google showed off its Echo competitor, Google Home. It's meant to be the hub for Google Assistant, the search giant's version of a personal assistant like Siri, Alexa, or Cortana. And Google repeatedly stressed that the AI which powers the assistant will become a sort of ""personal Google,"" software that learns your habits and needs and can anticipate the best response. Unfortunately Google Home can only work with a single account at a time. That means for some of its showcase features — ""What's my day look like?"" — the device can only respond with a calendar entries for me or my wife, and can't tell the difference between the two of us when we're speaking.

Could Google learn to tell certain voices apart?

Google told us that allowing multiple accounts is something they are working on, but didn't give any timeline for when it might arrive. It seems like the sort of thing that Google could solve using its advanced voice recognition, figuring out the difference in tone and timbre between my voice and my wife's. But trying to solve that problem also open the device up to making mistakes, and that is probably something Google wants to avoid with a brand-new product from a relatively new category.

According to Mario Queiroz, Google's vice president of product management, the ultimate goal for Home is to be able to identify different people in the room. That way, when you and someone else both ask Google Home for your daily schedules, ""you get different results,"" Queiroz told The Verge in an interview. When pressed on how this could be accomplished with anything but voice recognition, Quieroz was reluctant to mention anything more. He did, however, say, ""We are working on that design now."" Internal teams at Google, most of whom have both personal and work Gmail accounts, are testing how the process would work for both a family of multiple Gmail account owners and for people with multiple accounts themselves.

In its first promotional video for the device, Google kind of skirted around the issue, but appears to suggest voice recognition. We see a family of four, two parents and two kids. The woman can ask Google Home for an update on her schedule and dictates a text message to a friend. The same Home unit then gives the man a traffic updates on his ""usual schedule"" and send an alternate route to his phone. For the time being, that seamless transition between two very personal transactions isn't actually possible with Google Home, putting a serious crimp in a device that is being positioned as something that a family can share.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's all in the software. Yes, the Pixels will keep current with the latest version of Android and monthly security updates; those are important things! But this is no longer the bare ""stock"" Android that Nexus devices were always known for. Google has layered on new features exclusive to the Pixel and Pixel XL overtop Android 7.1 Nougat. A lot of the changes are cosmetic, but there's also some genuinely useful stuff that's reserved for Pixel owners. Here's all that's new.

Google Assistant

Google’s answer to Siri and Alexa is one of the Pixel’s biggest features. Google Assistant is more advanced and capable than the Google Now voice assistant on other Android phones; it’s more contextually aware to what’s happening on your devices and can tap into popular third-party apps like WhatsApp and OpenTable.

#Pixel is the first phone in the world with the Google Assistant built in. #madebygoogle pic.twitter.com/Smj1xQBUC0 — Google (@google) October 4, 2016

Daydream

Both Pixel phones are the first to support Google's virtual reality platform, Daydream. You'll need the new Daydream headset for a fully immersive experience. You'll be able to play VR games and watch video apps like YouTube, Netflix, and HBO directly inside the virtual reality experience.

Pixel Launcher

When you unlock the Pixel and Pixel XL, you’ll see a brand new home screen design that Google is calling Pixel Launcher. The app drawer button is gone; instead, you now swipe up from the bottom dock of apps to see all your apps and games. The date, time, and weather are in the top right, and tapping on Google's G logo will quickly get you to search.

Pixel Camera

Google finally made a good camera app! To go along with the Pixel’s 12-megapixel camera — touted as the best camera in any smartphone, ever — Google has unveiled Pixel Camera. With features like white balance control and exposure compensation, it’s a lot more capable than the old Nexus camera app. A new ""smart burst"" mode captures a stream of shots, and Google uses artificial intelligence to choose the clearest, best shot. The camera also uses HDR+ by default with ""zero shutter lag"" to achieve the maximum dynamic range for each shot.

Unlimited backups of photos and 4K videos at original quality

Pixel buyers get worry-free backup with Google Photos. All photos and videos (even 4K recordings) can be backed up — for free — with Google's cloud service.

Smart Storage

The Pixel phones come with either 32GB or 128GB of storage, but there’s no microSD card support. So if you’re running out of room at any point, the devices will automatically clear out photos and videos that have already been backed up to the cloud via Google Photos. Remember that those shots and recordings are stored at full quality, so you’ve got nothing to lose by removing them from local storage.

24/7 voice and chat support

If you’ve got a problem with either Pixel phone, you can head to the settings menu and immediately launch a voice call or chat session with Google’s customer support team. 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. From there, you can also choose to allow screen sharing so that the Google employee can control your device and show you firsthand how to fix whatever's not working right.

Easy switching from other phones

9/27/2016,0.446618357,0.157652613,775.5,785.99,774.31,783.01,1153247,11.68,7.51,1,"The wireless market is crowded, but despite the array of options it can be hard to find a good deal. and Verizon are well-established with widespread, high-quality service, but they also have the most expensive plans. Sprint and cost less, but can also be less reliable. And then there's a the whole horde of MVNO plans like Cricket Wireless, StraightTalk and MetroPCS that piggy-back off of other services to offer less costly plans.

Once an invitation-only service, Google's MVNO Project Fi opened to all comers in March 2016. It works by pinging off a three different carriers (, T-Mobile or Sprint) depending on which has the best signal where you are at the moment. Plans start at $20 for unlimited talk and text, and then each gigabyte of data is $10.

So at first glance, it seems like a great budget plan for someone looking for options outside of the America's four biggest carriers. I spent 30 days on the service, and while I wanted to love it, at the end I decided to move to another mobile provider. If you're thinking of switching to Project Fi, here are some of the biggest pros and cons to know about:

1. It has straightforward pricing and usage info.

It's easy to know exactly how much you're spending on Project Fi in a given month. You set how much you think you'll need in data each month (in my case, I rather optimistically estimated 1GB) and then are only charged for exactly how much you use. If you go over your estimate, you'll get charged for the additional data but not overage fees. If you use less, you'll get some money back.

It's also easy to track exactly how much data you're using with the Project Fi app, downloadable from the Google Play Store. It tells you when your next bill is due, how much data you've used compared to your estimated use for the month, and how much you've used each day.

2. It has fast, robot-free customer service.

The worst thing about calling most customer service lines is how difficult it is to talk to an actual person. The handful of times I had questions about my plan, I was able to log in to my account on the Project Fi website and open a chat window with a customer service person in under 5 minutes.

3. You have to have a Google Nexus phone.

Project Fi only works if you have a Nexus 6, 5X or 6P smartphone. While the Nexus phones are top-notch and get timely Android OS updates, this is still a pretty limiting selection.

4. It's good for frequent international travelers.

If you travel a lot and want to use your phone outside of the United States, this could be the plan for you. Project Fi lets you use your phones data normally (read: with no insane roaming fees) in 135 different countries. You can also make phone calls over Wi-Fi normally, or place calls on a cellular network for 20 cents per minute. Texts aren't any additional cost whether on Wi-Fi or a cell network.

In short, unless you're making a lot of calls outside of Wi-Fi, your phone will work normally at no extra charge at almost any country you want to travel to.

5. Data costs are the Achilles heel.

If you're a light data user (say just 1-2GB a month) Project Fi might be a great deal for you. But if you average more than 3GB, you're probably better off with another service. Say, for example, you want unlimited calls and texts and 4GB of data a month, that would cost $60 on Project Fi. For the same price, you can get an individual plan with unlimited data, talk and text on Sprint, or for $10 more you can get the same thing on T-Mobile.

One of Project Fi's biggest selling points is that it makes it easy to connect to Wi-Fi for your calls and data use, but even thought I live and work in the San Francisco Bay Area I found it difficult to be on Wi-Fi all the time. Just using my phone throughout my 45-min BART ride each way was enough to bust through my daily data budget.

While Project Fi will refund you for any data that you sign up for but don't use, if you're a power user data costs can still jack up the price significantly.

The company’s AI team calls it the Google Neural Machine Translation system, or GNMT, and it initially provided a less resource-intensive way to ingest a sentence in one language and produce that same sentence in another language. Instead of digesting each word or phrase as a standalone unit, as prior methods do, GNMT takes in the entire sentence as a whole.

""The advantage of this approach is that it requires fewer engineering design choices than previous Phrase-Based translation systems,"" writes Quoc V. Le and Mike Schuster, researchers on the Google Brain team. When the technique was first employed, it was able to match the accuracy of those existing translation systems. Over time, however, GNMT has proved capable of both producing superior results and working at the speed required of Google’s consumer apps and services. These improvements are detailed in a new paper published this week.

In some cases, Google says its GNMT system is even approaching human-level translation accuracy. That near-parity is restricted to transitions between related languages, like from English to Spanish and French. However, Google is eager to gather more data for ""notoriously difficult"" use cases, all of which will help its system learn and improve over time thanks to machine learning techniques. So starting today, Google is using its GNMT system for 100 percent of Chinese to English machine translations in the Google Translate mobile and web apps, accounting for around 18 million translations per day.

Google admits that its approach still has a ways to go. ""GNMT can still make significant errors that a human translator would never make, like dropping words and mistranslating proper names or rare terms,"" Le and Schuster explain, ""and translating sentences in isolation rather than considering the context of the paragraph or page. There is still a lot of work we can do to serve our users better."" But soon, as Google’s products and services continue vacuuming up valuable corner cases and rare phrasings, our phones may be capable of breaking down language barriers as effectively as a bilingual human being.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The driver of the vehicle passed through a red light as one of Google’s fleet of autonomous Lexus SUVs passed through a green light on Friday afternoon. The collision, which occurred at the intersection between El Camino Rea and Phyllis Ave in Mountain View, California, caused the Google car’s airbags to be deployed, and caved in its front and rear right-side doors.

Mountain View police said that no injuries were reported, but the Google car had to be towed away on a flatbed truck.

Google’s autonomous vehicles are no stranger to accidents, suffering multiple impacts with various vehicles. Mostly they’ve been rear-ended when either driving slowly or stationary at a junction, suffering minor damage. The side impact in this most recent accident is one of only a few that have caused major damage to the expensive test vehicles.

Google said that the car was in self-driving mode with a person sitting at the steering wheel. The Google car hit the brakes automatically on seeing the other car crossing the red light, followed by the human behind the wheel doing the same, but it wasn’t enough to prevent the collision.

James Allen, who happened upon the crash, told KBCW: “I’ve never seen one in an accident and I see at least 30 to 40 a day. They’re very good cars, that’s why I was so shocked.”

A Google spokesperson told 9to5Google: “Our light was green for at least six seconds before our car entered the intersection. Thousands of crashes happen everyday on US roads, and red-light running is the leading cause of urban crashes in the US. Human error plays a role in 94% of these crashes, which is why we’re developing fully self-driving technology to make our roads safer.”

3. There’s a T-Rex on the Google Campus, and it has a slightly terrifying message

But Google is already feeling death breathing down its neck – or is worried that it might. The company’s campus has a huge model of a T-Rex skeleton, which is meant to remind employees not to let the company go extinct.

4. And there’s a T-Rex game hiding in Google Chrome as well

The T-Rexes don’t end there. When Chrome doesn’t have an internet connection, it will show a warning about not being able to connect, alongside a picture of a little dinosaur.

And if you press the space bar when that’s showing, it will start a game where you run along as the dinosaur, jumping over any obstacles by pressing the space bar again. The game will last forever, because all of the obstacles are generated by the code.

5. Which is just one of the huge number of Easter Eggs hiding in Google products

Most of those can be found in search. And they tend to be fairly obvious, once yo know what they are – searching “askew” sends the results all crooked, for instance. You can find a full list of them here.

6. Google wasn’t very happy with becoming a generic word for searching

The company worried that the word – as in the phrase, “just Google it” – would undermine all of the work it had done to make its brand recognizable.

7. Google buys more other companies than you can imagine

Some estimates put Google’s buying habits at more than one company per week. Most of them are small – but some of them can be huge.

Many of the products simply get folded into others. But others, like Android, continue to exist on their own within Google’s fold – and, in that case, go on to be one of its most recognised products.

It very rarely sells them on again, though.

8. Google’s “I’m Feeling Lucky” button costs tens of millions of dollars per year

This button might seem like just a bit of fun, and that’s mostly what it is. But it’s expensive fun, for Google.

By just taking the user straight through to the first result, Google also skips past all the advertising that it would usually show to people when they get up to the results page. That means that it misses out on the advertising revenue, too.

But the company has been gradually getting around this, with a set of features that mean you probably wouldn’t even notice it.

Google Instant means that so long as you have it turned on and your connection is fast enough, for instance, you’ll start seeing results as soon as you start typing.

And Google is able to collect enough information about you as you browse around the internet that it can be fairly sure you’ll come into contact with one of its ads, even if not immediately.

9. The first ever Google storage was made of Lego

Nowadays, Google is one of the world’s biggest data storage companies – filling warehouse upon warehouse with servers to store people’s work, photos, emails and everything else. But at its very beginning, when it was known just as Backrub, its first storage was just a load of hard drives housed in a container built of Lego.

10. Google gives very generous payouts to the husbands and wives of people who die while working for them

They’ll receive 50 per cent of their salary for the next decade. And their children receive a payout until they’re grown up, too.

11. One Google search uses more computing power than it took to send the Apollo 11 astronauts to the moon

Searching Google is easy and takes just miliseconds. But the computing and networking power required to look through almost all of the known internet is huge – far more huge than the relatively minor amount of code and computing that it took to put humans on the moon.

Best Google's Doodles

12. Google once went down for five minutes, and took 40 per cent of web traffic with it

On 19 August, 2013, Google stopped working for five minutes. And it took much of the internet with it.

While other companies have looked to challenge Google’s dominance in search, it still represents a huge part of the web.

Nowadays, such an outage would be unlikely to cause such a problem – other sites, mostly Facebook, have challenged Google’s dominance as the central linking place of the world. But Google still accounts for a huge part of everything anyone finds or looks at on the internet.

13. Google hires goats

Google’s headquarters are big, and lots of it is green. So much of it is grass that it would need a lot of lawnmowers – but Google has a novel way around that.

Instead of gas-powered machines, Google hires a load of goats to clear the fields around its campus.

They visit for about a week at a time, and about 200 of them come to much up the Google grass.

The goats don’t guzzle gas, pollute the air or make as much noise. And they have the advantage of being “a lot cuter to watch than law mowers”, Google’s employees have noted.

14. And there are lots of dogs at Google too

Google’s office is very dog friendly. It says that letting people bring in their pups makes employees a lot happier.

Cats aren’t as encouraged – simply because they tend to be upset by the dogs. They’re not banned.

15. Indeed, one dog – the first ever – has the title of Top Dog

Yoshka is the only dog to be credited in Google’s official history – from when he joined alongside owner (and senior vice president of operations) Urs Hölzle early on in the company’s life in 1999. Yoshka even wrote a blog post on Google’s site, presumably dictating it – noting that there were now many other dogs, some much smaller than himself, but that all of them were welcome.

16. Google’s logo wasn’t in the middle until 2001

The simplicity of the Google homepage belies the fact that it is one of the most viewed things in the history of the world. So even the tiniest changes are significant – and some very not tiny changes were made in the site’s early development.

For instance, in the first few years the site was around, its logo was aligned slightly to the left. That came to an end in 2001, when Google finally moved it into the middle.

17. And it’s been making tiny little changes ever since

The company has been making the smallest adjustments to its logo ever since. Those have included, for instance, a minor change to the layout of the letters in its name. But they've also included big changes to how the words are written, including a new font.

But all of those are noticed and often marked in discussion about the company.

18. And those changes include its entire name

Perhaps the biggest change in recent years was to entirely alter the name of Google – and change it to Alphabet.

The alteration – which didn’t turn out to be as big or significant as it first seemed – essentially meant that the company called Google just ate up the search, internet and information bits of the business. All of the other bits that had traditionally also been called Google moved under the ownership of Alphabet – which also owned Google, the newly created search company.

Since then, most of the things that happen that people hear about continue to come out of Google. And often when they come from another company – like X, which makes its self-driving cars – everyone just calls it Google anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many reviewers showed mild, if underwhelmed interest in the new tool. ""This is fine,"" wrote Dieter Bohn at The Verge. It's an ""early-adopter curiosity that is fun to explore, but still miles from useful,"" said Nathan Olivarez-Giles at the Wall Street Journal . ""Unremarkable,"" though the virtual assistant is a ""step up on Cortana and Siri,"" PCWorld's Mark Hachman commented in comparing it to rival virtual assistants.

Meanwhile, privacy advocates took a much harder line against Google's creation. They bashed the service for failing to employ end-to-end encryption, a feature that secures conversations from hackers and Feds, by default. Further, they slammed Google ( goog ) for backtracking on its previous promise to only store data fleetingly, instead of retaining chat logs indefinitely (until a user chooses to delete them).

Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.

Here's what you need to know about Google Allo's privacy controversy.

Google hears you:

As aforementioned, Allo does not end-to-end encrypt chats by default. For the most vocal privacy advocates, this is a non-starter. It means that standard conversations on Google Allo are read, not only by users and their recipients, but by Google's virtual assistant. This choice, in privacy proponents' view, is unsettling—and it adds a potential point of vulnerability into the design: Google's servers (as secure as they may be).

What is #Allo? A Google app that records every message you ever send and makes it available to police upon request. https://t.co/EdPRC0G7Py - Edward Snowden (@Snowden) September 21, 2016

To Google this is a plus. By not encrypting chats end-to-end —which would effectively lock out parties not sending or receiving a given message—Google is able to run its artificial intelligence wizardry on your conversations to better suggest replies, relevant Web search results, info an upcoming flights and planned events, and the occasional joke. Access to chat data allows the company to build smarter AI products, presumably hooking more users, generating ""stickiness,"" and adding still more ways to make money for the mothership. For the search giant, it's a virtuous cycle.

How to stay undercover:

Allo's design makes it easier for federal investigators and spies to obtain your data. That threat became more pronounced after Google backed down from its previous promise not to store people's chat data for long on its servers. Now the company says it will keep chat logs indefinitely to improve its service, as The Verge has pointed out . You do have the option to wipe the records, which is nice—but it would be better, others argue, if the app asked you from the start where and for how long you prefer to store your data. (On your device or on Google's remote servers? A day or forever?)

What people want: tech companies not storing their chat logs. What tech companies give them -- pointless bots. pic.twitter.com/2ypCmFpRV0 - Matthew Green (@matthew_d_green) September 21, 2016

Allo does, however, offer an end-to-end encrypted chat option. It's called ""incognito mode,"" after the Google Chrome mode that doesn't store browser history. This feature allows you to chat discreetly, without worrying about a Google bot (or Fed, or hacker) digesting your every emoji, and it allows you to set a timer for self-destructing messages. Even better, the mode employs the widely lauded Signal protocol, an end-to-end encryption scheme also used in WhatsApp, by default, and in Facebook ( fb ) Messenger's ""secret conversations"" mode. Not everything has to be on the record, necessarily.

Search, email, chat...:

Don't get the wrong idea: Data sent via Allo are not entirely unencrypted. Allo scrambles messages sent between you and Google's servers, and between those servers and recipients. Applying this security measure is far, far, far better than transmitting or storing chats in plaintext, which any interloper can snoop on. It's fair to say no chat app would launch without such protection—it would be dead on arrival with consumers.

Free for download today: Google Mail, Google Maps, and Google Surveillance. That's #Allo. Don't use Allo. https://t.co/EdPRC0G7Py - Edward Snowden (@Snowden) September 21, 2016

This really isn't any different from the practices Google has in place for search and Gmail. With Allo, the company has translated its business model into a different medium: a mobile-only (for now) chat app. The company builds a tunnel between you and Google's data centers, its machines read and log your private data and, in return, the company supplies digital assistance, pockets ad money, and complies with search warrants. If you consider this too invasive and wish to rebel, then you might take the opportunity to reconsider your use of Google's services, generally.

Allo, or Goodbye?

Whether you decide to use Allo depends on how much you trust Google and what level of risk you're willing to accept. It's worth noting that you probably use plenty of services that aren't end-to-end encrypted by default, like Facebook Messenger, Twitter direct messages, Slack, and Snapchat. If the encryption setup is a deal-breaker for you, you might wish to stick to one of the many competing chat apps that lacks an embedded bot but employs end-to-end encryption by default, like WhatsApp, Apple's ( aapl ) iMessage, or Signal. Otherwise, consider keeping Allo's incognito mode always booted up.

One final criticism that Allo's detractors have raised: The app may train people to prefer an AI assistant over the added privacy of an end-to-end encrypted chat. For those concerned about the continuously challenged legal status of strong, end-to-end encryption in the U.S. and elsewhere, this design choice seems a step backward.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And it believes its Allo messaging app is different enough to compete against Apple's iMessage, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and all the rest. That's because it's the first to include Google Assistant, which I can only describe as a mega chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to bring you answers in a conversational manner.

Available as a free download today on Android and iOS, Allo was first introduced during Google I/O in conjunction with Google's web-calling app Duo (which, since launching a month ago, has now reached 10 million downloads on Android).

Though it sends and receives messages as well as the others, Allo has its own promising features that I found useful. Read on to see what makes Allo stand out and if it has what it takes to be your new chat app.

Google Assistant: The ultimate bot

Allo's standout feature is Google Assistant, which is basically a bot you can chat with that uses Google's vast search database to answer several kinds of questions you throw its way. For example, you can type, ""Cafes nearby?"" and it will find popular coffee shops in your area (just make sure you have location turned on). You can ask it to translate phrases in different languages, show your latest emails, look up airfare prices and other common queries.

If you're feeling particularly playful (or lonely), you can play games with it too. (The geography quiz game is educational, but I particularly like the one where you have to guess the movie based only on emojis.)

If you're not already in Allo, it's faster to press the home button and relay questions to Apple's Siri or Google's other digital assistant, Google Now. But Assistant does come in handy when the app is open in front of you (plus you can still ask it questions verbally), and you want to look something up without leaving.

This is especially useful when you're in a group chat. A search for ""popular bars"" shows results to everyone on the chat thread, so the group can plan from there. Allo can settle debates, too -- like when you and your friend can't remember what last night's sports score was or when a particular movie came out. Assistant will immediately put the issue to rest, in writing.

Smart Reply: Never at a loss for words

Smart Replies are generic responses that pop up above the keyboard and text field. Though the replies are canned (for example, autogenerated responses to the question, ""Are you busy?"" include ""What's up?"" ""Not really, you?"" and, ""Yes. Why?""), they can be quite colloquial and somewhat natural-sounding time-savers.

Enlarge Image Lynn La/CNET

This is a little unnerving since you're never quite sure if the responses you receive are authentic or just a Smart Reply. The phrases also feel pretty inane if you try to form a full conversation with them (replying to a conversation formed completely from Smart Reply started to feel like chatting with the SmarterChild bot circa 2001). However, they are useful when you're on the go and have to quickly respond, or you just don't have the brainpower to trudge through online small talk. Just don't try and use it for more sensitive, serious conversations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As humans, we’re pretty good at communication. If someone says “the girl saw a man with the binoculars,” we can generally use contextual clues to figure out if they meant that the girl saw the man by using binoculars, or saw a man who was carrying binoculars.

Teaching a robot to do the same is a bigger challenge. Add in ambiguity (by “get me a lift” do you mean any old car, or a Lyft, specifically?) and there’s an endless number of ways to say pretty much any one thing… and, well, the challenge becomes huge.

API.AI helps developers who are building bots tackle this by providing them with tools to keep them from endlessly reinventing the wheel. Their APIs handle things like speech recognition, intent recognition and context management, and allows devs to provide domain-specific knowledge (like that “deep dish” and “Chicago-style” can probably mean the same thing to your pizza delivery bot) that might be unique to your bot’s needs.

API.AI currently plays friendly with 15 languages/dialects, including English, Chinese, French, German and Spanish.

According to a running counter on its homepage, API.AI has processed a little over 3 billion API requests to date. Meanwhile, Google says over 60,000 developers have built stuff with API.AI’s toolset.

Called Google Trips, the iOS and Android app pulls in a combination of data from Google Maps and crowdsourced contributions from other travelers, in order to offer a personalized travel guide that helps you keep track of your day trips, reservations, points of interest, tourist attractions, restaurants and more.

We already knew Google was working on a travel application, thanks to a leak earlier this year when the app was being tested within Google’s Local Guides community. Local Guides help to improve Google Maps and business data by writing reviews, correcting listings, and taking photos. In return, they gain exclusive access to try out new Google products and features, such as Google Trips.

The app looks today much like it did then.

The home screen includes a search box with a prompt “where do you want to go?” for planning new trips, and other cards let you keep track of your current and upcoming vacations and plans.

What’s helpful is that each city you plan to visit during one of your trips can each have its own tab within the larger “Trip” section, and with a simple toggle switch, you can download all the information about that destination for offline access.

Meanwhile, on each city’s screen, a variety of colorful cards help you jump into various sections like “Saved places,” “Day Plans,” “Food & Drink,” “Getting around,” “Things to do,” “Reservations,” and more.

But the app isn’t just for collecting information – it can also make suggestions. Google says Trips can show you the most popular day plans and itineraries for the top 200 cities worldwide. This information is actually based on historic visit data from other travelers, which Google has then assembled into lists that include the most popular sights and attractions.

Also interesting is how this crowdsourced data is combined with other information pulled from Google Maps to help you find things to do near one of your planned sightseeing destinations.

You can add a spot you want to visit to your plans, and you even can tell the app if you have only the morning or afternoon available for this outing. The app can then show you other attractions near that original spot, so you can take in other sights worth seeing within having to commute too far.

This can definitely help with time-constrained trip planning, as it allows you to cram in more activities within a certain vicinity.

Plus, there’s some automation involved here, too – you can tap and pin a spot you have to visit to your itinerary, and Google Trips will automatically fill in the rest of the day for you. Meanwhile, you can also tap a “magic wand” button for more options of nearby sights, then pin those you like to further customize your itinerary.

In addition to sightseeing, the app can also track flight, hotel, car and restaurant reservations, which makes the app something of a competitor to Concur’s TripIt, and, to some extent, the new territory Airbnb is carving out with its own forthcoming Airbnb Trips app, which will focus on travel services.

However, what makes Google Trips compelling is that it leverages Google’s ability to tap into the data you have stored in your Gmail, as it automatically gathers your reservations from your email and organizes them into trips on your behalf.

While the new app will be useful for travelers, it will also serve as another means of data collection for Google itself, which will be able to better augment its business listings data in Google Maps with the information collected by the app and its users.

Google Trips is live now on Android and iOS.

In a report published by Sputnik News, psychologist Robert Epstein reveals evidence that Google is manipulating search results related to Hillary Clinton that may “shift as many as 3 million votes” in the upcoming presidential election.

Earlier this year, Matt Lieberman of Sourcefed published a video that claimed Google’s autocomplete suggestions were biased in favour of Clinton. The video went viral, with an abridged version of it being viewed over 25 million times on Facebook.

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Epstein set out with his colleagues at the American Institute for Behavioral Research (AIBRT) to investigate the claims. They concluded that whilst the investigation is ongoing, their report “generally supports” Lieberman’s video.

In order to test the results, Epstein and his associates tested hundreds of different response terms related to the election, using Yahoo and Bing search as a control. Each search was also conducted through proxy servers, such as the Tor network, to make it very difficult for Google to identify the researchers and thus customize the search results for them.

It is somewhat difficult to get the Google search bar to suggest negative searches related to Mrs. Clinton or to make any Clinton-related suggestions when one types a negative search term. Bing and Yahoo, on the other hand, often show a number of negative suggestions in response to the same search terms. Bing and Yahoo seem to be showing us what people are actually searching for; Google is showing us something else — but what, and for what purpose? As for Google Trends, as Lieberman reported, Google indeed withholds negative search terms for Mrs. Clinton even when such terms show high popularity in Trends. We have also found that Google often suggests positive search terms for Mrs. Clinton even when such terms are nearly invisible in Trends. The widely held belief, reinforced by Google’s own documentation, that Google’s search suggestions are based on “what other people are searching for” seems to be untrue in many instances. Google tries to explain away such findings by saying its search bar is programmed to avoid suggesting searches that portray people in a negative light. As far as we can tell, this claim is false; Google suppresses negative suggestions selectively, not across the board. It is easy to get autocomplete to suggest negative searches related to prominent people, one of whom happens to be Mrs. Clinton’s opponent.

Epstein attached screenshots of some of the searches he conducted, clearly showing a lack of negative results for Clinton, in contrast to negative search results for rival Donald Trump. It was also not a case of people simply not searching for these terms on Google — Google Trends shows the search rates between the relevant keywords, with negative Hillary results usually trending higher.

Moreover, Epstein suggests that these autocomplete results will have a dramatic effect on the election itself.

Over time, differentially suppressing negative search suggestions will repeatedly expose millions of people to far more positive search results for one political candidate than for the other. Research I have been conducting since 2013 with Ronald Robertson of Northeastern University has shown that high-ranking search results that favor one candidate can easily shift 20 percent or more of undecided voters toward that candidate — up to 80 percent in some demographic groups, as I noted earlier. This is because of the enormous trust people have in computer-generated search results, which people mistakenly believe are completely impartial and objective — just as they mistakenly believe search suggestions are completely impartial and objective. Perhaps you are skeptical about my claims. Perhaps you are also not seeing, on balance, a pro-Hillary bias in the search suggestions you receive on your computer. Perhaps you are also not concerned about the possibility that search suggestions can be used systematically to nudge people’s searches in one direction or another. If you are skeptical in any or all of these ways, ask yourself this: Why, to begin with, is Google censoring its search suggestions? (And it certainly acknowledges doing so.) Why doesn’t it just show us, say, the top ten most popular searches related to whatever we are typing? Why, in particular, is it suppressing negative information? Are Google’s leaders afraid we will have panic attacks and sue the company if we are directed to dark and disturbing web pages? Do they not trust us to make up our own minds about things? Do they think we are children? Without whistleblowers or warrants, no one can prove Google executives are using digital shenanigans to influence elections, but I don’t see how we can rule out that possibility. There is nothing illegal about manipulating people using search suggestions and search rankings — quite the contrary, in fact — and it makes good financial sense for a company to use every legal means at its disposal to support its preferred candidates.

In a postscript, Epstein reveals that he is, in fact, a Clinton supporter himself, but concludes that he does not believe it would be “right for her to win the presidency because of the invisible, large-scale manipulations of a private company. That would make democracy meaningless.”

Google wants its next big business, enterprise services, to be just as all-encompassing and unavoidable. That’s the primary motivation behind its move, announced this morning, to acquire Apigee, a company that went public last year, for $625 million.

Put simply, Apigee builds software tools that let non-tech companies create the kind of tech they couldn’t on their own. If Burberry, an Apigee customer, wanted to use an app for retail or customer services, it would turn to Apigee.

With Apigee in tow, Google would have another point of entry to reach corporate clients, something it has made a big effort to do since hiring Diane Greene, its enterprise SVP, back in November. Initial reactions by sources in the industry applauded the deal as smart (and thrifty) for Google, although Google’s enterprise arm faces stiff competition from Amazon, Microsoft and Salesforce.

Diane Greene: This is a great one. As we spend more and more time with our enterprise customers — current ones, future ones, ones in the process — the API systems come up continually.

Since I’ve started, I’ve had two [customers] ask what they thought of Apigee. The partners out there are saying that getting their API strategy functioning is a key step for their business.

You don’t have to wait on the phone. You just do it programmatically. It’s kind of an exploding area. As we provide the end-to-end solutions for what our customers want to do digitally, this is a big part of what they want to do in all kinds of verticals.

With app engines and containers, we’ve eliminated a lot of the code needed — sort of the back end of the back end. Now we can provide the front end of that back-end service.

Is this acquisition more about deepening your ties with current customers or reaching new ones?

Certainly [Google and Apigee] have overlap in our customers. We also complement each other. More than anything, it makes it so clear to the enterprise of how dedicated we are in a forward-looking way.

Is the entire Apigee staff coming over? Will they work under your organization?

We can’t comment on that. We have to let [the deal] close.

Okay. How do you see the deal fitting into what you’ve done since joining in November?

We just brought this organization together — the sales and marketing. Now we’re in a position where we can go talk to an enterprise with a single face. We can partner them with our engineers. Which they love, because they’re good engineers!

This just further complements and gives them all the components that they need and want. We’ve got a single team now. We’re all excited at the rate at which we’re developing functionality.

Google made a serious investment in us. We’ve got a lot of work to do. But this is the biggest thing I’ve experienced.

You’ve invested heavily in machine learning and artificial intelligence to set the cloud operations apart. How does that fit in with the Apigee product?

It also fetched Mr. Jacobs’s latest Twitter posts and the location of a nearby doctor with the same name. During the coming fashion weeks, however, the same search is expected to generate photos from Mr. Jacobs’s show, messages from the designer about inspirations for his collection and behind-the-scenes videos of models and makeup artists preparing for the show. For brands on a see-now-buy-now show schedule, Google will allow people to shop for the latest looks directly from the search page.

Little wonder Google, which teamed with the former Maxim editor and street style pioneer Kate Lanphear for the initiative, said it had signed more than 50 brands so far to the new search, including Marc Jacobs, Tom Ford, Christopher Kane, Prada, Burberry and Hermès.

This experimental approach is meant to allow users to hear directly from participants during major events, a company spokesman said. Google did this in January for a Republican presidential primary debate on Fox News. A search for “Fox News debate” yielded candidates’ own videos, answers to questions they weren’t asked and rebuttals.

Since a Google search is often the first stop for people casually interested in a subject, this allows brands to “go front and center with the most aspirational vision of their products,” said Maureen Mullen, the chief strategy officer for L2, a research and advisory firm for consumer brands.

It’s clear then what designers gain from these searches. But what’s in it for consumers? And what about Google?

Having designers play a role in what people see in searches “brings fashion week to life in a new way,” said Cameron McKnight, a product manager at Google. In theory, it allows creators to communicate their own visions more directly, rather than relying on third-party interpretation, be it from critics or retailers.

But this approach calls into question the integrity of Google search results. What happens when what brands want on a search page conflicts with providing the best search results? Google said that brand results would only appear during fashion weeks, and would not affect the links summoned by the algorithmic search. “It will supplement the existing search results,” said Rami Banna, a Google product manager.

As for Google, special events like fashion weeks build a loyal and engaged audience, a must for advertisers. (Brands do not pay to participate in the initiative.) “For any of these platforms, it’s important to command the attention of fashion and luxury brands, because they are the ultimate arbiters of taste,” said Ms. Mullen of L2.

Indeed, Google’s experiment will make the company competitive in wooing the fashion industry, pitting it against such platforms as Instagram, which has been particularly effective in casting itself as fashion’s friend.

Kevin Systrom, Instagram’s co-founder and chief executive, is a regular on the fashion show circuit, attending Balmain’s show in Paris in October 2015 and Prada’s February 2016 show in Milan. His October 2015 wedding to Nicole Schuetz was even featured in Vogue. Last year, the company hired Eva Chen, the former editor of the style magazine Lucky, as the head of fashion partnerships.

Ms. Chen and her team work with models, designers and stylists, providing tips on the best ways to use Instagram. For example, she advises designers that a finished runway look shouldn’t be just one Instagram post; it could be five posts: the inspiration board, the different materials, the models getting ready, a slow-motion video of the models wearing the clothes, and the finished look.

As a result, L2 found that Instagram accounted for 97 percent of social media engagement (measured by likes and comments) during February’s fashion weeks.

Google has been accused of deleting Palestine from Google Maps – but the truth is, it was never labelled by Google in the first place.

When searching for Palestine on Google Maps, it shows an outline, but with no label for Palestine and Israel labelled alongside it. While 136 members of the United Nations recognise Palestine as an independent state, the US and much of the west does not.

The representation of Palestine on Google Maps has not changed recently, but after the forum of Palestinian journalists released a statement condemning Google, word spread via social media and later news outlets. People began sharing their outrage using the hashtag #PalestineIsHere.

Talbia Akbar Khan (@talbiaakbar) Removing #Palestine from the map doesn't mean it ceases to exist. #PalestineIsHere pic.twitter.com/uQfIDcJOka

A Google spokeswoman said: “There has never been a ‘Palestine’ label on Google Maps, however we discovered a bug that removed the labels for ‘West Bank’ and ‘Gaza Strip’. We’re working quickly to bring these labels back to the area.”

A petition from March this year urging Google to include Palestine on their maps has gained traction in the last few days, now with almost 250,000 signatures.



While nothing has changed, the online outrage has pointed to questions about how mapping technologies affect people’s understanding of the world. The Washington Post’s Caitlyn Dewey wrote:

In their attempts to dispassionately document the physical world online, tech companies often end up shaping our understanding of it, too. That’s not something that we tend to think about often, but it does become pretty obvious when a map changes/is said to have changed, or when we compare different maps against each other.

This is not the first time Google has got into hot water over disputed territories – and it’s likely not to be the last. A 2014 project called Disputed Territories documented how Google Maps attempts to stay out of geographical disputes and issues of national identity.

Keeping the servers cool as they crunch numbers is such a challenge that Facebook even built one of its facilities on the edge of the Arctic Circle. Well, Google has a different solution to this problem: putting its DeepMind artificial intelligence unit in charge and using AI to manage power usage in parts of its data centers. The results of this experiment? A 40 percent reduction in the amount of electricity needed for cooling, which Google describes as a ""phenomenal step forward.""

savings of hundreds of millions of dollars

After accounting for ""electrical losses and other non-cooling inefficiencies,"" this 40 percent reduction translated into a 15 percent reduction in overall power saving, says Google. Considering that the company used some 4,402,836 MWh of electricity in 2014 (equivalent to the amount of energy consumed by 366,903 US households), this 15 percent will translate into savings of hundreds of millions of dollars over the years. And when you remember that Google reportedly paid $600 million for UK-based DeepMind back in 2014, it seems the company's bet on AI will pay for itself before too long.

Speaking to Bloomberg, DeepMind co-founder Demis Hassabis said that the specially designed neural networks control ""about 120 variables in the data centers,"" including ""the fans and the cooling systems and so on, and windows and other things."" The AI worked out the most efficient methods of cooling by analyzing data from sensors among the server racks, including information on things like temperatures and pump speeds. DeepMind's engineers say the next step is identify where new data is needed to calculate further efficiencies, and to deploy sensors in those areas.

And the company won't stop with Google's data centers. ""Because the algorithm is a general-purpose framework to understand complex dynamics, we plan to apply this to other challenges in the data centre environment and beyond in the coming months,"" said DeepMind in a blog post. ""Possible applications of this technology include improving power plant conversion efficiency [...], reducing semiconductor manufacturing energy and water usage, or helping manufacturing facilities increase throughput.""

Living across 18 tiny sub-polar islands in the north Atlantic, Faroe islanders are used to working in difficult conditions. So tired of waiting for Google Street View to come and map the roads, causeways and bridges of the archipelago, a team has set up its own mapping project – Sheep View 360.

With the help of a local shepherd and a specially built harness built by a fellow islander, Durita Dahl Andreassen of Visit Faroe Islands has fitted five of the island’s sheep with a 360-degree camera.

As the sheep walk and graze around the island, the pictures are sent back to Andreassen with GPS co-ordinates, which she then uploads to Google Street View.

“Here in the Faroe Islands we have to do things our way,” says Andreassen. “Knowing that we are so small and Google is so big, we felt this was the thing to do.”

So far the Sheep View team have taken panoramic images of five locations on the island. They have also produced 360 video so you can explore the island as if you are, quite literally, a sheep.

The islands have a population of 80,000 sheep and 49,188 humans.

As well as obviously helping promote the island to visitors, the project is part of a campaign to convince Google to come to the island to complete the mapping project. Visit Faroe Islands have launched a petition and the hashtag #wewantgooglestreetview to promote its case.

But would Google Street View ruin the beauty that comes from being such an isolated place? “I think that we’re ready for this,” says Andreassen. “It’s a place that has always been so hidden and far away from everything, but I think that we are ready to invite people to the place.”

Guardian Travel contacted Google to ask if they had any plans to map the Faroe Islands. They would not comment, but pointed out that anyone is welcome to create their own Street View experiences and apply to borrow Google’s camera equipment.

However, he excoriated Symantec for the danger of the errors and its incompetence in allowing them. In one case, he found a buffer overflow flaw in the company's ""unpacker,"" which searches for hidden trojans and worms. ""Because no interaction is necessary to exploit it, this is a wormable vulnerability with potentially devastating consequences,"" he says. ""An attacker could easily compromise an entire enterprise fleet."" He added that the unpackers have kernel access, which is ""maybe not the best idea.""

That’s the charge levied by Elizabeth Warren in a speech the Massachusetts senator delivered today in Washington.

Warren singled out three of tech’s biggest players in a speech about the perils of “consolidation and concentration” throughout the economy. It comes the day after Hillary Clinton, Warren’s recent stage-mate, laid out a “technology agenda” that seemed designed to please Silicon Valley.

Warren had different beefs with Google, Apple and Amazon, but the common thread was that she accused each one of using its powerful platform to “lock out smaller guys and newer guys,” including some that compete with Google, Apple and Amazon.

Google, she said, uses “its dominant search engine to harm rivals of its Google Plus user review feature;” Apple “has placed conditions on its rivals that make it difficult for them to offer competitive streaming services” that compete with Apple Music; and Amazon “uses its position as the dominant bookseller to steer consumers to books published by Amazon to the detriment of other publishers.”

“Google, Apple and Amazon have created disruptive technologies that changed the world, and ... they deserve to be highly profitable and successful,” Warren said. “But the opportunity to compete must remain open for new entrants and smaller competitors that want their chance to change the world again.”

Not included in Warren’s list: Facebook, which certainly has platform power that freaks out everyone in the media business.

Then again, Facebook doesn’t have a home-grown product that competes with the product the media business creates — unless you want to argue that Facebook’s main product is the user-generated content it is now favoring over the stuff publishers make.

Reps for Google, Apple and Amazon all declined to comment.

But Spotify, which has complained about the fee Apple charges music services — and other services — that sign up subscribers using its iOS platform, was happy to comment. Here’s Jonathan Prince, who runs communications and public policy for the streaming music company:

“Apple has long used its control of iOS to squash competition in music, driving up the prices of its competitors, inappropriately forbidding us from telling our customers about lower prices, and giving itself unfair advantages across its platform through everything from the lock screen to Siri. You know there’s something wrong when Apple makes more off a Spotify subscription than it does off an Apple Music subscription and doesn’t share any of that with the music industry. They want to have their cake and eat everyone else’s too.”

Warren’s speech didn’t only go after the tech sector. Other targets included Walmart and Comcast, which owns a minority stake in Vox Media, which owns this site.

Her main critique was directed at politicians and regulators she thinks have abandoned their responsibility to “restore and defend competition.” Warren doesn’t expect those same politicians to pass new legislation to fix any of this, but she does want them to “enforce our laws in the way Congress originally intended them to be enforced.”

This isn’t the first time Warren has gone after some of Silicon Valley’s standard-bearers. Earlier this spring she laid into Uber and other “gig economy” companies; Clinton made her own critique of that sector last year.

I can’t imagine that Warren’s newest words will reverberate in techland. It would be nice if they did.

The predominant mindset when it comes to competition in Silicon Valley is that the best tech company wins until it doesn’t, and is replaced by a competitor that does it better. When we do talk about competition, it tends to be about fights between giants, usually about little stuff. Hey! Why won’t Amazon sell Apple TVs?

And when it comes to platforms, we usually hear that companies that have built enormously powerful platforms get to operate them any way they see fit — and that the people who built them are going to make the best decisions about this stuff, anyway.

But these things are enormously powerful platforms, built on the same internet that Silicon Valley says should be treated as a public utility. If the platform owners don’t want to end up with Washington regulating, say, the size of their app store fees, they ought to work hard to keep themselves in check.

Only three companies in the top 20 (Coca Cola, Under Armor, and Black Rock) were not in the tech industry. These days though, plenty of businesses consider themselves a part of that sector. Take the CEO of Goldman Sachs, who refers to the financial firm as a tech company. Furthermore, coding has become the most important job skill across industries. As the LinkedIn report notes, with every company going through a tech-driven transformation, “being a talent magnet is going to be what separates the winners from the also-rans.” Photo: courtesy of Google Google cinched the top spot among the 40 top attractors. In addition to perks like free meals and massages along with a culture that supports diversity and the creation of the “perfect” team, Google has no trouble drawing candidates. One former Google recruiter estimated that he reviewed 3 million resumes in one year. But what does it really take to get a job at the top organizations? Tech knowledge, is of course, a requirement. However, Chris Bolte, the cofounder and CEO of Paysa, a big-data platform providing market insight about compensation and retention, says he’s seeing another trend that is clinching jobs for those without a traditional computer science degree. “The most explosive growth we’re seeing is the emergence of deep learning,” says Bolte. He explains, “It’s a branch of machine learning and artificial intelligence leveraging what are called neural networks.” At its simplest, the neural network functions like a web of interconnected brain cells inside a computer that can parse signals from images or video, for example. It can learn to recognize patterns and make decisions in a human way.

Bolte explains that deep learning extends a number of layers “deeper” than what was previously computationally feasible. He says given the amount of data Internet giants create, coupled with the advancement of computing, these deep learning methods are able to model signals more completely. Artificial intelligence and machine learning as broader skills offer opportunity to a variety of tech talent. In a recent interview with Fast Company, senior machine learning recruiter at Microsoft Amanda Papp revealed: “Not everyone has to have that PhD in computer science. We have folks that have more physics backgrounds or biomathematics or permutational biology. [Machine learning] doesn’t necessarily have to have that standard comp-sci path.” Paysa’s data shows that programming is still in high demand. At Google, for example, nearly half (45%) of its 60,000 employees know Java, and 42% know Python. Only 13% are knowledgeable in Git (open source software development), and 14% have skills in cloud computing. The majority (83%) of employees at Google have a bachelor’s degree, but only 7% come from Stanford. Other schools include Colorado School of Mines, Carnegie Mellon, and University College Dublin. The No. 2 company on the list, Salesforce, has 20,000 people on staff, but their top skills are somewhat different than those at Google. As many as 46% know cloud computing and 39% are versed in agile methodologies (project management for software development). Eighty percent hold bachelor’s degrees and draw from schools such as University of California Berkeley, Southeast University, Arizona State, and University of Illinois at Urbana. Photo: courtesy of Facebook At Facebook, programming languages are in demand. Paysa data indicates that 46% of Facebook employees know Java and 44% know Python. Other top skills include C++, distributed systems, algorithms, and machine learning. Similar to the other two companies, most employees (84%) have a four-year degree, but 42% of Facebookers hold master’s degrees, too. This lends credence to recent research that more employers are looking to hire candidates with advanced degrees. However, Apple isn’t pushing for higher education among all of its workforce. Only 71% of its 100,000 employees earned bachelor’s degrees, and 28% report not having a degree at all. This is due, in part, to the fact that not every employee is working on development in its Cupertino headquarters. This can also be seen in the most prevalent skill among Apple’s ranks, software development (28%), with Java coming in second at 27%. Photo: courtesy of Amazon Rounding out the LinkedIn top five is Amazon. The e-commerce juggernaut draws many of its staffers from nearby University of Washington in Seattle, and 83% of its employees hold bachelor’s degrees. More than half (57%) know Java, and 45% are skilled in software development.

Here, on thin parchment, the earth is a wobbly blue watercolor dot centered around the sacred Mount Meru, close to a large red circle representing Beijing. China and Korea make up the large part of the map, while the foreign lands beyond their borders are like afterthoughts, represented only by a thin peripheral strip of land.

Ed’s friend Tom Harper, the soft spoken maps curator at the British Library, explains the strange cartography. “The rest of the world wasn’t necessary to this insular culture at this time, so it just doesn’t appear,” he notes. Because of this obvious disregard for Western imperial standards of empiricism and accuracy, the Chonhado was derided for decades by cartographers and historians. And yet its premise—putting yourself at the center of the world—isn’t far from that of the digital maps being ferociously assembled today by Google and other modern-day mapping giants. In this vision of the world, we are the tiny blue dots at the center of the map, like billions of miniaturized Chonhados. The Chonhado, the Korean atlas of the heavens and earth Photo: Library of Congress Previously, Parsons says, maps were “created by someone else for whatever purpose they created it for, and it was the same map that everyone else saw. But now your map is literally your map.” It is billions of people’s maps, according to Google, but it is also Google’s map, and as the company’s Geospatial Technologist, Parsons’s job is meant to make users and governments feel comfortable with Google’s control of it. As it seeks to maintain growth, Alphabet Inc. has bet big on personalizing Google’s flagship products—search, maps, and mail—which means capitalizing upon ever more sensitive information about where users go, and what they do there. “That is my job, to be that kind of lightning conductor, good and bad,” he says. “My job is about evangelism, trying to get people to see the world the way that we see the world.” A jovial middle-aged Brit schooled in geography and cartography, Parsons has been at the forefront of the digital mapping revolution for two decades, first at Autodesk and then in the public sector, as the first—and only—CTO of Ordnance Survey, Great Britain’s national mapping agency. “I probably represent something that Google’s not very good at, and that’s having a human face.”

It was in that capacity that Parsons first crossed paths with engineer Brian McClendon and entrepreneur John Hanke. In 2001, the two founded Keyhole, Inc. and launched EarthViewer, a satellite mapping application. Keyhole survived the dot-com crash by providing its technology to real estate and tourism companies, as well as to U.S. military and intelligence agencies; among its investors was the CIA’s venture capital fund, In-Q-Tel. But much of the public hadn’t heard of Keyhole until it began working with CNN to broadcast satellite images of Iraq during the 2003 U.S. invasion.

When they demoed their software for Larry Page and Sergey Brin in April 2004, says McClendon, “they came back with an offer to buy the company the next day.” EarthViewer would become the basis for Google Earth, which, along with Maps, launched the following year. (McClendon left Alphabet in 2015 and now runs Uber’s Advanced Technologies Center, where he is helping develop the company’s self-driving car project; like Google’s and Apple’s, such cars are only as reliable as the digital maps underneath them.) What was true of the Chonhado was once true of Google Earth: its focus began around the area most important to its makers, the U.S. “You would see the oceans, but if you panned them out, there was nothing there,” remembers Hanke. “It was like one of these maps made in the dark ages, because Google hadn’t acquired the rights to incorporate that data into the product.” To this day, Windows users launching Google Earth for the first time will see the Earth centered near McClendon’s childhood home in Lawrence, Kansas. When he arrived at Google’s London office in 2007, Parsons was in many ways perfectly poised to help acquire the missing parts of the map, in part by convincing governments to share their data with the company: at the Ordnance Survey, he played a crucial role as the British government’s liaison to Hanke and McClendon as they assembled Google’s map of the United Kingdom. Within the company’s geo group, said Rebecca Moore, director of engineering for Google Earth, Parsons cuts a “CTO-like figure.” But he also plays a role outside the company, gathering ideas, forging partnerships with academics, government, and technologists, and promoting Google’s mission to organize the world’s geographic information. “I probably represent something that Google’s not very good at, and that’s having a human face,” he says. Not surprisingly, helping to steward the world’s largest map involves traveling all over it. Parsons’s personal website details recent stops in Hungary, California, Belgium, and Paris. On these trips, he meets with academics, GIS researchers, public servants, and private vendors in the hopes of getting the cartographic community to “game mindshare” with him, as he puts it, in “reinventing cartography” and thinking about “the where of everything.” At a 2014 conference, Parsons’s presentation included a discussion of the Catalhoyuk map, a faded stone mural dated to 6500 BC, said to be the world’s oldest map. “If we’re really honest, the techniques that we’ve used in cartography haven’t really changed much in those 8500 years, where we’ve gone from writing on cave walls, to etching, to printing on paper, to ultimately producing maps that will appear on screens,” he told the audience. “We haven’t made that leap to say the media is radically different.” But Google has been making that leap, layering in up-to-the-minute travel information and user-generated data to bring Maps closer to what Parsons calls a “selfie for the planet.” On recent trips to Malta and Belfast, he loyally contributed to improving the product using Google’s Street View and Maps apps, snapping photos and panoramas, including one with his “family sniggering in the background.”

“It was in Google Maps within two minutes,” he said. “Because it was me, it went through the process a little bit quicker.” When members of the public upload photos and corrections to Maps, they first go through Google’s moderators, who make up one of its largest teams around the world and maintain its “database of things”—sights, restaurants, hotels, anything that appears with a rating on Google maps. Near Rawalpindi, a Pakistani city less than 10 miles southwest of Islamabad, a moderator-vetted user added a park in the shape of an Android robot peeing on an Apple logo. Moderators removed it after another user posted a screenshot on Facebook. Google Maps The system isn’t perfect. “We’ve had to work hard on moderation,” he says, mentioning a 2015 incident in which someone digitized “a lake in the shape of an Android pissing on an Apple logo,” Google called it “inappropriate user-created content.” “That didn’t go down very well. We had to make our moderation processes a bit more robust.” Parsons is one of few visible players in the company’s Geo unit, which encompasses all of Google’s geospatial technologies— Led by Jen Fitzpatrick, one of the company’s first female engineers, the unit works on apps like Google Maps and Google Earth, but also critical databases used in search, mail, and more. The effort is so large—and dependent upon manpower, from engineers to the drivers of Street View cars—that Google does not specify how many of its employees are devoted to geospatial technology. (In 2012, it said the number was over 7,100.) But other numbers are telling: Google Maps enjoys over 1 billion monthly active users, the company says, making it the world’s most used map. Google Maps ranks no. 6 among U.S. smartphone users, between Search, at 5, and Gmail; Apple Maps is no. 13 according to a January report by ComScore. (Apple, for its part, has claimed that iPhone users now turn to its Maps application 3.5X more than “the next leading mapping app.”) Parsons hopes Google’s maps pass what it calls “the toothbrush test”: “You only use your toothbrush every day because you’re completely confident that it’s not poisoning you.” Of all Google searches, says McClendon, approximately 30% are local in nature, and 10% are maps- related. These days, the company reports, location-related searches are growing 50% faster than all mobile searches. In 2013, a report commissioned by Google estimated that the value of Geo services is between $150 to $270 billion in revenue annually–in addition to 1.1 billion hours saved per year by keeping people from getting lost or “avoiding wasted journey time.” To compete with a range of tech titans—besides Apple, companies like Nokia, TomTom, and Microsoft have invested heavily in mapping technologies—Google is focusing on personalization. Parsons’s hope is that using an increasingly personalized Google Maps—and syncing one’s location with surrounding devices, from your cell phone to your garage, heater, and car—will pass what Google calls “the toothbrush test.”

“Is the technology so valuable, so familiar, that you use it every day, that you don’t really think about it?” Parsons asks. “To get that level of trust, we need people to understand and be completely confident with it. You only use your toothbrush every day because you’re completely confident that it’s not poisoning you, it’s not going to make your teeth fall out.” Photo: Irina Palei via Shutterstock The Future Of Earth And Maps Getting Google’s mapping apps to pass the toothbrush test is crucial to the company’s plans for geospatial expansion. Though the Google Earth API was deprecated in 2014 and will be fully shut down by the end of the year, its imagery is now largely incorporated into the Maps satellite view. The plan, says Parsons, is to bring Maps and Earth even closer together. “What we’re looking to do is to go back to that ethos of Google Earth being the canvas upon which you can put your own content, which we’ve kind of lost in Google Maps at the moment,” says Parsons. The revamped Google Earth, which will run on both mobile phones and browsers–and which Moore and Parsons can only say will arrive “soon”—will aim to meet the goal set forward during its earliest days: “that Google Earth would be the browser for the planet,” says Parsons. “The same way that you use Internet Explorer or Chrome or Safari to go and visit websites, you’d use Google Earth to go and visit places, and you could author information about those places within Google Earth and then share those things,” says Parsons. “For example, ‘this is where I went on holiday,’ or ‘this is my view of the political geography of South Africa,’ and use Google Earth as a tool for making that story available to people.” Immersive maps “enriched with information and enriched with interactivity, or transformed into entertainment,” Hanke says, “will be something people expect.”

The new Google Earth will “reinvent it for the web and mobile,” making it “much more of a storytelling platform,” Moore says. “It will have feeds of information coming in that make it a dashboard for the planet. If you hear about something going on, you’ll open Google Earth and that’s where you’ll find out what’s happening.” Augmented reality and indoor mapping are also becoming a large part of Google’s Geo operation—an internal division called “Project Tango” is building “a mobile device that can see how we see,” in order to create 3-D maps of indoor spaces, among other capabilities. That will bring Google Maps closer to the interactive geospatial apps like Field Trip, Ingress, and Pokemon GO that Hanke has been creating at Niantic Labs, the startup he launched within Google in 2010.

“I don’t know if Pokemon Go becomes part of Google Maps,” Hanke said when I asked whether he thinks his two creations might blend. “But I think people’s experience of being in places, and being transformed digitally—either enriched with information and enriched with interactivity, or transformed into entertainment—I definitely think that people will become accustomed to that and it will be something people expect.” The newest Maps update includes “promoted pins” among other features Google Maps, meanwhile, has been undergoing more incremental tweaks. Google has incorporated traffic data from Waze, the crowdsourced traffic mapping app that it bought in 2013 for $1 billion, into Maps. As it searches for new revenue, the Alphabet Inc. company has also made various efforts to fuse its ad-based model with geography. Under its latest update to Maps, users will begin to see logos—”promoted pins” in Googlespeak—for nearby coffee shops, gas stations, or restaurants, while revamped local business pages can now contain special offers and in some cases the ability to browse product inventory. “We’ve got a very rich source of data there, but also one that we have to be very careful of. Your location on the planet is one of the most sensitive pieces of information that anyone can hold on you.”

The best emblem for the company’s literally global ambitions may not be Google Earth but Street View, which amounts to essentially the most immersive and detailed “map” of the world ever made. The future of Google Maps may closely resemble a dynamic version of Street View, with up-to-the-minute information and imagery, but it’s a future that merits caution too: after privacy concerns emerged around its Street View program, Germany investigated and ultimately fined Google for covertly collecting data from unencrypted Wi-Fi networks using Street View cars—surveillance as cartography. This concern isn’t lost on Parsons: if you use Google Maps, the company more or less knows where you are, where you’re going, and what you’re looking for. “We’re kind of looking at what to do with it. We’ve got a very rich source of data there, but also one that we have to be very careful of,” he says. “Your location on the planet is one of the most sensitive pieces of information that anyone can hold on you.” Google says it uses anonymized user locations to map car and consumer traffic, while specific information about individual locations is strictly managed internally. Parsons paints a more nuanced picture. “Actually, it’s very hard to truly anonymize that sort of data. At the moment, we track you as an individual and we strip off the first 20 minutes and the last 20 minutes of tracking, so we don’t know where you start or end, or where your home or where your work is. But, actually, over a period of a few days and weeks we can certainly start to build those tracks and understand where people are moving around—and potentially identify people from that.” “We are very, very cautious about that sort of data,” he hastens to add. “We’d never give it to someone else.” Changes—And Big Fusses The leap from page to screen may have made cartography accessible to more people—and made maps into 3-D, immersive experiences—but it’s also worried some mapping purists, as cartographers have been replaced by their modern-day successors: computer scientists and user-interface designers.

“It’s no longer about paper—it’s about painting pixels,” says Parsons. “Different techniques are needed and required. But you still need that process of abstracting the information that’s most important.” “Cartographers have almost ended up being historians, kind of looking at what cartography was rather than looking forward, saying, well, what’s the potential of augmented reality?” Something has certainly been lost in the translation from local and analog to global and digital: Before the era of Google Maps, each nation had its own cartographic conventions, making for a rich array of designs—often at the expense of foreign travelers. Google prioritizes efficiency, mapping the world according to a single set of conventions aimed at making the world so legible that it often takes an active effort to get lost. But Google’s approach may come at the expense of local cartographic conventions, aesthetics, and geo-political markers, critics worry. “As a citizen, I’m concerned that Google maps looks so banal—it’s like Pleasantville, visually,” says Anne Knowles, a GIS historian at the University of Maine. “It bewitches people that the world is okay, and we’re shocked when it’s not.” To Parsons, trading traditional maps for more practical models is worth the utility gained in getting Google users from point A to point B more efficiently. “Probably, computer scientists aren’t the best ones to figure out how to do that–we really need cartographers,” he admits. Still, “cartography has largely ignored on-screen mapping. Cartographers have almost ended up being historians, kind of looking at what cartography was rather than looking forward, saying, well, what’s the potential of augmented reality? What does that mean for cartography?” “Cartographers have spent centuries thinking about and optimizing information on a piece of paper that can be interpreted both by experts and, later, by novices,” says McClendon. “But the challenge with Google Maps is it’s a dynamic map—it changes based on the zoom level. At each zoom level you go down in the map, there’s more and more information shown.” Breaking with the cartographic past isn’t easy. Consider the minor uproar Google caused when it readjusted its zoom settings to remove extraneous labels: “What happened to Google Maps?” the popular maps developer and writer Justin O’Beirne wondered aloud, as he concluded that the company had “dropped” 38 cities from the map. “No, it’s not you: Google maps really did get crappy,” Quartz editors quipped when they re-published his article.

“There’s been this big fuss–well, you know, it’s us making changes. That’s what happens,” says Parsons. Nothing had been “dropped” from the map: Google merely adjusted which labels appear for certain zoom levels and functions. “I think part of the problem is, many people look at Google Maps as being this static thing. They think in terms of the paper map, and the paper map doesn’t change,” he says. “We do A/B testing for almost everything—we’ll have different populations of maps users being shown different things, and we’ll see what works best. Do they follow the directions we give them? Do they get lost?” “That’s one of the ‘creepy big brother’ elements—we know when you get lost, because you’re not following the directions we’ve told you to follow.” Cartographers have always come under fire for mapping the lives of others—Google just does so more accurately and quickly than ever before. “In the 1840s, the Ordnance Survey had the same battle,” Harper interjects. “At what scale will we map the country? Richer landowners didn’t want their property to be mapped at a large scale. Quite naturally, there was a reluctance to have their lives, spaces, published… if you go back even further to the 16th and 17th centuries when England was colonizing Ireland, surveyors were murdered for trespassing. Nothing’s changed, really.” Those battles set precedents for some of the ones that Google is currently waging. In countries like India and South Korea, national security concerns have led governments to clamp down on mapping services, in some cases deliberately obscuring directions and satellite imagery. Google Maps appears differently depending on the country of your IP address, allowing the company to stay on the right side of the law in the many jurisdictions where it operates. Log in from China, for instance, and Google Maps is strictly controlled by the government, which deliberately inserts errors into GPS systems close to sensitive locations. Those who visit Google.com/maps are presented with the company’s “most universal” rendering of the world. Of course, Google Maps also appears differently depending on who you are—it is designed to highlight businesses on your journey that your friends may have frequented, or that might be of particular interest to you. “Whatever we do, we do universally, we do it for everybody,” says Parsons, but in Google’s increasingly user-centric world, that means helping each of its users see the world in a way that is most relevant to their life and work—perhaps not that of others.

“Our view is different from Apple’s, from Microsoft’s, from OpenStreetMap, from any other map provider… Our maps represent what you or I need to do on a day-to-day basis in the developed part of the world.” This dynamism is its singular strength and its most cited weakness. As the product becomes increasingly ubiquitous, users are apt to take the information it provides as gospel—“Don’t try to outsmart Google, you’ll always lose,” a good friend solemnly advised after an ill-advised road trip detour. But blindly trusting Google can also lead one astray: in March, a demolition company in Rowlett, Texas, tore down the wrong home after Google Maps directed its employees to the wrong address. “There are sources of canonical data–they are ‘the facts,’” says Parsons, who is adamant that Google is not a canonical source in the same way the Ordnance Survey, U.S. Geographic Survey, or the Metropolitan Transportation Authority might be. “We are perhaps the great editors. We do our job to bring you a view of the world that is as consistent and as canonical as it possibly could be, but we’re not the source.” “All maps are imperfect,” says McClendon. But Google’s rendering of the world is “as close to reality as we’ll be able to get for a long time.” Ed Parsons That hasn’t stopped Google’s open-source rival, OpenStreetMap, from taking a more democratic approach to mapping the planet. Whereas Google Maps is a proprietary stream of data resting on a range of private and public and crowdsourced inputs, OpenStreetMap is maintained by a community of volunteers using open data. Parsons is involved “on and off” with the platform, which he calls “a fabulous project,” but one that reflects the enthusiasm of its makers so much that “it’s become almost a parody.” “Cartography is about what you take off, not about what you add,” he says. “I think the community is still learning what cartography actually means. There are companies making a profit—Mapbox, CartoDB—starting to do some interesting things on top of that. It’s like we’re learning again. It’s like the early days of desktop publishing, where everyone would put 50 fonts on their document, because they could. You just want one font, really, that’s what you need.” None of these maps is more perfect than the others, Parsons says; each map is influenced by its creators, with their own worldview. “We as an organization do our best to explain how we come up [with our] worldview–how we come up to that worldview, where it’s coming from, what we’re interested in—but it is our view, and our view is different from Apple’s, from Microsoft’s, from OpenStreetMap, from any other map provider,” says Parsons. “We are representing the world as is valuable and useful to our users. Our maps represent what you or I need to do on a day-to-day basis in the developed part of the world.”

As part of its efforts to map everywhere—and bring everyone to the map—Google has also empowered groups traditionally written out of Western maps to craft their own portrait of the world. Rebecca Moore, who in addition to running Google Earth’s engineering team, leads Google Earth Outreach, has worked with indigenous peoples in the Amazon, like the Surui tribe, to help them map their territory using their own symbols. This can, for example, make it easier for them to map the locations of the three specific types of trees they use to make arrows. In “the new Google Earth, we make the ability to make a custom map even easier to do, to discover, to share,” says Moore. Within five years, Google Earth will have mapped 100% of the Amazon rainforest, she adds. A self-described “lapsed aviator,” Parsons is one of the few team members from the early days of Google Maps who remains at the company, and he takes a bird’s-eye view of its potential. “I love seeing the world from above. Part of the thing that appealed to me about geography is that it explains the world. It explains why mountains are where they are, why river valleys are where they are, why cities are where they are, and why they’re the shape they are. And you get a wonderful view of that when you’re flying over it, and you get the ultimate view when you can control where you’re flying over.” The more interactive and personally tailored Google Maps gets—the more accurately it simulates actually flying over the world—the better. “I try, in my presentations, to show the Apollo 8 “Earthrise” picture. Less than 10 people have seen that with their own eyes, but yet we get to see that every day. I often wonder, will that change how society views the world—being able to go from the very local, very detailed view, to the world view. It’s something that’s never been possible before.” “I hope that it allows us to recognize the fact that we all do live on the same planet,” he says. “Our own little part of the world is only a few swipes of a mouse away from someone else, and their own little piece of the world. You know, it’s no accident that often you see Google Earth and there are no boundaries, because that’s the way the world is. “At the same time,” he adds, with politic caution, “I think it is important that you can switch on the borders, and you can draw the lines, because they are important.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SAN FRANCISCO — Google image searches for ""three black teenagers"" and ""three white teenagers"" get very different results, raising troubling questions about how racial bias in society and the media is reflected online.

Kabir Alli, an 18-year-old graduating senior from Clover Hill High School in Midlothian, Va., posted a video clip on Twitter this week of a Google image search for ""three black teenagers"" which turned up an array of police mugshots. He and friends then searched for ""three white teenagers,"" and found groups of smiling young people.

""I had actually heard about this search from one of my friends and just wanted to see everything for myself. I didn't think it would actually be true,"" Alli told USA TODAY. ""When I saw the results I was nothing short of shocked.""

The Twitter post has been retweeted nearly 65,000 times since Tuesday, and Twitter users are using the hashtag #threeblackteenagers to discuss the implications of the video. The conversation about online racism comes as people express anger that the photo of Brock Turner, a white former Stanford University student convicted in a high-profile sexual assault case, was from high school yearbook, not his police mugshot.

""I understand it's all just an algorithm based on most visited pages but Google should be able to have more control over something like that,"" Alli said.

YOOOOOO LOOK AT THIS pic.twitter.com/uY1JysFm8w — July 3rd. (@iBeKabir) June 7, 2016

People have been flagging racial bias in the results of search engines for years. Google says it's merely reflecting back the biases that exist in society and that show up in what and how people search online.

In an emailed statement, Google said its image search results are a reflection of what's on the Web, including the frequency with which certain types of images appear and how they are described.

""This means that sometimes unpleasant portrayals of sensitive subject matter online can affect what image search results appear for a given query,"" the statement read. ""These results don’t reflect Google’s own opinions or beliefs — as a company, we strongly value a diversity of perspectives, ideas and cultures.""

Some people agreed. ""Loooool. Not Google's fault, though. Just means black people need to work on stock online presentation and presence,"" one person tweeted.

Alli says he, too, does not believe Google is racist. Since tweeting about the results, they have changed somewhat, largely as a result of his online experiment.

I'm weak at y'all saying Google is racist ??? — July 3rd. (@iBeKabir) June 8, 2016

""The fact all these mugshots came up is wrong, but black males making poor choices also plays a major role. If we don't want that image we need to work to change it,"" he said. ""It shouldn't be so difficult to find normal non-offensive pictures of three black teenagers. That search sort of portrays us as a whole and those pictures are not us. We have a lot to offer and that search does not do us any kind of justice.""

UCLA information studies and African American studies professor Safiya Umoja Noble says society should not let Google off the hook so easily.

""Google has had many, many incidents of racial bias appearing in its algorithm. It consistently issues a statement that it's not responsible for the output of its algorithm. And yet we have to ask ourselves: If Google is not responsible for its algorithm, who is?"" said Noble, who is writing a book that compiles and analyzes the social consequences of racially-biased online searches.

Basically, the algorithm Google employs to show search results learns the biases of searchers and then reinforces it by showing those results more often. That is evident in top search results for white grandma (Grandma VanDoren's White Bread Recipe and Grandma's Bakery in White Bear Lake, MN) and black grandma (porn videos). Not all algorithms work the same. Search results on Bing.com and Yahoo search are different, surfacing a public television documentary Mexico & Peru: The Black Grandma in the Closet and black granny boots. Google is far more influential, handling at least two trillion searches a year.

Best way for Google to reflect positive images of Black youth is for folks to share/post great pics https://t.co/YOgEiFDSp2#3blackteenagers — Danny Sullivan (@dannysullivan) June 9, 2016

Some say search engines should do more, not just to address the bias surfaced by algorithms, but to use algorithms to combat it.

With cuts to public education and increased reliance on technology to deliver answers, search engines wield more power than ever before in deciding what information is seen and what information is important. People view Google as an unassailable source of credible and reliable information. Yet, what's often missing in search results that are not curated by a thoughtful hand, say a librarian or teacher: awareness of gender stereotypes and racial biases.

According to the Pew Research Center, 91% of search engine users say they always or nearly always find the information they are seeking when using a search engine and 73% of them say that most or all of the information they find is accurate and trustworthy.

""And they are when you are looking for the hours for the local Starbucks,"" said Noble. ""But when you are looking for information, ideas or concepts, the algorithm often fails us deeply and yet society does not really see that the algorithm as a failure except when these kinds of egregious moments happen.""

Longtime Google observer Danny Sullivan says Google is reflecting what's happening on the Web and ""the problems of society as a whole."" But, says the founding editor of Search Engine Land, ""Google could perhaps find appropriate ways to adjust.""

For generic image searches for groups of people such as ""black teenagers,"" Google could, for example, return more positive images, Sullivan said.

""If someone is going to search for mugshots, we are not looking for Google to give back positive-looking mugshots. It does not mean you won't find negative content if you go looking for it,"" Sullivan said. ""I do think Google needs to spend more time looking at what they are doing and asking themselves how they balance being a reflection of what's across the Web with also making sure that they are not reinforcing things and that they are making sure people are fairly treated.""

Christian Sandvig, professor of information at the University of Michigan, proposes a ""Consumer Reports"" approach to algorithms.

""We need a systematic approach to this issue that independently monitors these systems from the outside,"" Sandvig said.

""These companies are happy to assume responsibility for blocking content that makes their sites unpleasant to use and might eat into advertising revenue,"" he said. ""But when they are asked about other kinds of content — content that represents a more subtle problem or doesn't threaten the user experience of their product — we get the argument that objective algorithms made these decisions based on our own behavior. This implies: 'Since these decisions were made by a computer program, they are inhuman, and therefore we aren't responsible for them.' This begs the question: Aren't programmers human? Don't humans work at Google?""

This is not the first time that Google search results have been called out.

Last year Google apologized — and suspended people's ability to submit edits to Google Maps — after searches using a racial epithet directed users to the White House.

Graphic designer Johanna Burai set up World White Web after noticing Google searches for photos of hands returned photos of white hands. The site, WorldWhiteWeb.net, encourages people to link to images of hands that are not white.

Burai toldBuzzFeed News in April that the project, which showed similar results for other body parts and search terms such as man, woman and child, illustrated societal biases.

In a similar query, student Bonnie Kamona searched ""unprofessional hairstyles for work"" and says the results featured African-American women. For ""professional hairstyles for work,"" the results featured blonde white women.

The search, as The Guardianpointed out, surfaced images of black women from blogs and articles that were ""explicitly discussing and protesting against racist attitudes to hair.""

I saw a tweet saying ""Google unprofessional hairstyles for work"". I did. Then I checked the 'professional' ones ??? pic.twitter.com/5KLg7FZ6Hq — madikizela malema (@BonKamona) April 5, 2016

Last July, Google apologized after its Photos app automatically labeled black people as ""gorillas."" Programmer Jacky Alciné tweeted a screenshot of photos he had uploaded in which the app had labeled Alcine and a friend, both African American, ""gorillas.""

A month earlier, Yahoo's Flickr service rolled out new technology to help tag photos. It identified a black man and a white woman as apes on two occasions.

A 2013 study by Latanya Sweeney, a professor at Harvard University, found ""statistically significant discrimination"" in online advertising results. Names associated with black people ""generated ads suggestive of an arrest in 81 to 86% of name searches on one web site and 92 to 95% on the other,"" the study found, while names associated with white people generated more neutral results.

""These companies are not doing the user test keyword searches that African Americans are doing. This is one of the reasons we consistently see this happening,"" Noble said.

And it's only photos I have with her it's doing this with (results truncated b/c personal): pic.twitter.com/h7MTXd3wgo — Jacky Alciné (@jackyalcine) June 29, 2015

One of the culprits: the chronic lack of diversity inside Silicon Valley technology companies, Noble says.

At Google, seven out of 10 employees are men. Most employees are white (60%) and Asian (31%). Latinos made up just 3% of the work force and African Americans just 2% — a far cry from reflecting the racial and ethnic diversity of its users in the U.S. and around the world.

""We are talking about fixing the culture in companies and fixing the woefully under-educated work force in Silicon Valley where people are not trained in ethnic studies and they are not trained in women's studies,"" said Noble. ""They have no idea what the import of the work is having in the social dimension.""

The company had set up shop right next to Google’s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., which was curious, because Google tightly controls most of the land in the area. Then a reporter spotted patent filings showing Zee.Aero was working on a small, all-electric plane that could take off and land vertically—a flying car.

In the handful of news articles that ensued, all the startup would say was that it wasn’t affiliated with Google or any other technology company. Then it stopped answering media inquiries altogether. Employees say they were even given wallet-size cards with instructions on how to deflect questions from reporters. After that, the only information that trickled out came from amateur pilots, who occasionally posted pictures of a strange-looking plane taking off from a nearby airport.

Turns out, Zee.Aero doesn’t belong to Google or its holding company, Alphabet. It belongs to Larry Page, Google’s co-founder. Page has personally funded Zee.Aero since its launch in 2010 while demanding that his involvement stay hidden from the public, according to 10 people with intimate knowledge of the company. Zee.Aero, however, is just one part of Page’s plan to usher in an age of personalized air travel, free from gridlocked streets and the cramped indignities of modern flight. Like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, Page is using his personal fortune to build the future of his childhood dreams.

The Zee.Aero headquarters, located at 2700 Broderick Way, is a 30,000-square-foot, two-story white building with an ugly, blocky design and an industrial feel. Page initially restricted the Zee.Aero crew to the first floor, retaining the second floor for a man cave worthy of a multibillionaire: bedroom, bathroom, expensive paintings, a treadmill-like climbing wall, and one of SpaceX’s first rocket engines—a gift from his pal Musk. As part of the secrecy, Zee.Aero employees didn’t refer to Page by name; he was known as GUS, the guy upstairs. Soon enough, they needed the upstairs space, too, and engineers looked on in awe as GUS’s paintings, exercise gear, and rocket engine were hauled away.

“What appears in the next 5 to 10 years will be incredible”

Zee.Aero now employs close to 150 people. Its operations have expanded to an airport hangar in Hollister, about a 70-minute drive south from Mountain View, where a pair of prototype aircraft takes regular test flights. The company also has a manufacturing facility on NASA’s Ames Research Center campus at the edge of Mountain View. Page has spent more than $100 million on Zee.Aero, say two of the people familiar with the company, and he’s not done yet. Last year a second Page-backed flying-car startup, Kitty Hawk, began operations and registered its headquarters to a two-story office building on the end of a tree-lined cul-de-sac about a half-mile away from Zee’s offices. Kitty Hawk’s staffers, sequestered from the Zee.Aero team, are working on a competing design. Its president, according to 2015 business filings, was Sebastian Thrun, th­e godfather of Google’s self-driving car program and the founder of research division Google X. Page and Google declined to speak about Zee.Aero or Kitty Hawk, as did Thrun.

Flying cars, of course, are ridiculous. Lone-wolf inventors have tried to build them for decades, with little to show for their efforts besides disappointed investors and depleted bank accounts. Those failures have done little to lessen the yearning: In the nerd hierarchy of needs, the flying car is up there with downloadable brains and a working holodeck.

But better materials, autonomous navigation systems, and other technical advances have convinced a growing body of smart, wealthy, and apparently serious people that within the next few years we’ll have a self-flying car that takes off and lands vertically—or at least a small, electric, mostly autonomous commuter plane. About a dozen companies around the world, including startups and giant aerospace manufacturers, are working on prototypes. Furthest along, it appears, are the companies Page is quietly funding. “Over the past five years, there have been these tremendous advances in the under­lying technology,” says Mark Moore, an aeronautical engineer who’s spent his career designing advanced aircraft at NASA. “What appears in the next 5 to 10 years will be incredible.”

Northern California in particular has had a long fascination with flying cars. In 1927 a now mostly forgotten ­engineer named Alexander Weygers first began thinking up the design for a flying saucer that could zip between rooftops. In 1945 he received a patent for what he described as a “­discopter,” a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) machine with room inside for passengers to walk around, cook, and sleep. He depicted smaller versions landing in pods atop buildings in downtown San Francisco. No discopters were built, though it’s believed that the U.S. Army, which paid visits to Weygers’s compound in Carmel Valley, Calif., tinkered with a prototype.

Today, the world’s premier ­flying-car enthusiast is Paul Moller, 79, a professor emeritus at the University of California at Davis. Fifty years ago, when he was teaching mechanical and aeronautical engineering, he developed a specific vision: an aircraft you could park in your garage, drive a few blocks to a small runway, then take skyward. He tested his first prototype, the XM-2, in 1966. The XM-2 resembled a flying saucer with a seat at its center protected by a plastic bubble. It managed an altitude of 4 feet, while graduate students held it steady with ropes. “We were worried if the machine got out of control, we might kill a few people,” Moller says.

“Self-flying aircraft is so much easier than what the auto companies are trying to do with self-driving cars”

In 1989 his M200X made it to 50 feet above the ground. Then came the M150 Skycar, the M400 Skycar, the 100LS, the 200LS, the Neuera 200, and the Firefly, all variations on the same Jetsonian idea. In January 2000, Moller gave a speech on flying cars at the Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), the birthplace of the graphical user interface and, for nerds, sacred ground. Afterward, an engineer in his late 20s walked up and said he was interested in the concept but was skeptical that streetworthy personal aircraft were technically feasible; at the time, Moller didn’t recognize young Larry Page.

Moller kept trying. He says he burned through more than $100 million developing his designs and declared personal bankruptcy in 2009.

That same year, Moore, the NASA researcher, published a paper describing a concept plane called the Puffin. Moore’s big idea was to use electric motors, which are quieter and safer and have far fewer moving parts than internal combustion engines or conventional turbines. “By going to electric propulsion, you get rid of the vast majority of the complexity, cost, and unreliability,” Moore says. “This is why com­panies looking at this area aren’t insane.” Moore credits Musk’s Tesla and other automakers with advancing the technology. “Electric motors were mostly used in industrial settings where they were stationary, and no one cared about their weight that much,” Moore says. “It wasn’t until the automotive industry got interested that they started to get more lightweight.”

Carmakers invested in other areas, too, that are helpful for building small electric planes, particularly batteries and the semiconductors that control them. Self-driving systems, like the kind Google uses in its Koala cars, are perhaps a decade away from mainstream use on the roads, but they may already be good enough for the skies. “Self-flying aircraft is so much easier than what the auto companies are trying to do with self-driving cars,” Moore says.

Moore’s paper circulated, rekindling excitement. Sometime in 2009, a small group of engineers had begun meeting in Silicon Valley to discuss funding an electric-plane project. One of them was JoeBen Bevirt, a mechanical engineer and entrepreneur who had studied under Moller at UC Davis. Another was Ilan Kroo, an aeronautics and astronautics professor at Stanford. And another was Page. Although it initially looked as if they might all team up, Kroo and Page broke off to start Zee.Aero. Alone, Bevirt founded Joby Aviation, a company he hopes will beat Zee.Aero to market and prove that his efforts with Moller—and the older man’s life’s work—weren’t in vain.

Bevirt owns a 500-acre compound near Santa Cruz, Calif. To get there, you turn onto idyllic California State Route 1 and drive past the boardwalk, a few blocks of strip malls, and 15 miles of undeveloped, windswept coastal dunes. Then you turn onto a dirt road, pass a lake and a grove of towering redwoods, and walk through gardens overflowing with lavender and roses. It’s here that Bevirt has built a series of workshops, plus housing for about half of his 35 employees.

Bevirt grew up nearby on an electricity-free commune where his mom worked as a midwife and his father built custom homes. From a young age, he learned his way around toolboxes and construction sites, and was an avid reader. After consuming the sci-fi classic The Forever Formula in elementary school, he decided he wanted to build the kind of personal aircraft the book’s hero flew and persuaded a friend to help. “We built lots of prototypes, but they always crashed and burned,” he says. They shifted to custom bikes.

The flying-car dream stuck with Bevirt as he entered UC Davis in 1991 to study mechanical engineering, and he quickly found himself working for Moller, building one prototype after another. Bevirt eventually concluded their shared dream wouldn’t be feasible until battery and motor technology improved. He figured he’d need to wait 20 years. “Paul had been working on this for 30 years, and he was 50 years ahead of his time,” he says.

Bevirt got his bachelor’s, and then a master’s in mechanical engineering from Stanford. He worked in biotech after graduation, co-founding a company called Velocity11 that built robots to sequence DNA. His next company, called Joby (his childhood nickname), sold camera accessories such as flexible plastic tripods. Joby turned Bevirt into a multimillionaire. In 2008 he started Joby Energy, a maker of airborne wind turbines whose technology Google later acquired. The 20-year mark was approaching, so in 2009 he also used some of his wealth to buy the 500 acres and start Joby Aviation.

Its headquarters is an engineer’s fantasyland. The focal point is a large wooden building where two dozen workers sit at a few rows of desks jammed with computers. Aside from the clusters of large black monitors, the place feels more like a barn than an office. Aircraft prototypes hang from the ceiling, as does a thick climbing rope for exercise. In the open kitchen, abutting a long redwood dining table in one corner, a cook uses ingredients from the nearby gardens to prepare three meals a day. While the smell of a Malaysian curry fills the room, a banjo twangs from speakers overhead.

The manufacturing happens at a series of buildings about 100 yards downhill, past gardens and an outdoor clay pizza oven. One of the buildings is an airy warehouse with a giant oven inside—but this one isn’t for pizza. It’s used to cure the ­carbon-fiber bodies of the planes and looks like a Quonset hut. Former members of Oracle’s America’s Cup sailing team, some of the world’s leading materials experts, oversee the curing process, baking the carbon fiber at about 194F. In another building, engineers build ­cantaloupe-size electric motors; in a third, they test electronics; in a fourth, they put the finishing touches on wings and other parts. Out back, there’s a large truck with an extendible arm atop its trailer like a cherry picker, which hoists propellers high into the air so engineers can perform wind tests while driving down a road at high speed. Robotic prototypes buzz around.

Bevirt funded Joby Aviation by himself until last year, when he was joined by Paul Sciarra, one of the co-founders of Pinterest. Sciarra grew up in New Jersey, taught himself to code, hit it big with Pinterest, then went looking for something new to throw himself into. He, too, concluded that electric motors and batteries appeared to have applications well beyond the auto industry. “The goal is to build a product that impacts the lives of lots of people,” Sciarra says. “Not just folks that are amateur pilots or wealthy, but everyone.”

Sciarra and Bevirt hope to begin flying a human-scale prototype plane later this year. They won’t give the exact ­specifications but suggest that it could hold, say, a family of four and travel 100 miles or so on a full charge. The vehicle looks like a plane-helicopter hybrid packed with propellers, about eight mounted on the wings and tail. For takeoff and landing, the propellers hang horizontally like a helicopter’s and rotate for forward propulsion once in the air. Joby Aviation has already built smaller prototypes and has models of the plane’s body, wings, and propellers scattered about the manufacturing facilities. Bevirt and Sciarra see the vehicle taking off from parking garages, roofs, or areas alongside highways. They want to offer flights as an Uber-like service—summon a plane when you need it.

The Joby aircraft looks similar to other vehicles being built around the world. In May the German company E-volo conducted manned flights of its Volocopter, a two-seat aircraft powered by 18 propellers. Other flying-car startups include AeroMobil, Lilium Aviation, and Terrafugia. Even Airbus has built a two-seater prototype at its Silicon Valley labs, say two people familiar with the designs.

In 2013, Red Bull held one of its Flugtag competitions in Long Beach, Calif. Flugtag is a televised spectacle where hobbyists see how far they can launch their homemade flying machines off a dock. It’s more about entertainment than sustained flight—the contraptions generally dive straight into the water, and everyone laughs. At this one, though, a group called the Chicken Whisperers stunned the assembled crowd. Dressed in full-body baby-chick outfits, the team pushed its glider off the dock and watched as it cruised 258 feet, breaking the previous record of 229 feet. The chickens danced. They clucked. They took a swim in the water. They were all Zee.Aero employees in disguise, having fun, trying out some designs.

In the six years since its founding, Zee.Aero has hired some of the brightest young aerospace designers, software engineers, and experts in motor and battery hardware. They’ve come from places such as SpaceX, NASA, and Boeing, and they’re all chasing after the goal presented succinctly on Zee.Aero’s spare website: “We’re changing personal aviation.”

At its outset, Zee.Aero was led by Kroo, the Stanford aerospace professor. He wrote the original Zee.Aero patent, No. 9,242,738, which shows a strange-looking one-seater aircraft with a long, narrow body. Behind the craft’s cockpit, rows of horizontal propellers run along both sides of the body of the plane to handle the VTOL work. There’s also a wing at the back with two more propellers that add forward thrust.

Zee.Aero worked on this design for a couple of years. Small, computer-controlled versions of the aircraft were photographed by reporters and hobbyists sitting in the parking lot at 2700 Broderick Way. None of the prototypes were big enough to fit a human.

Over time, the company realized this might not be the best design, according to three former Zee.Aero employees. Page also grew dissatisfied with the rate of progress. In 2015, Kroo returned to teach at Stanford full time but continued to advise Zee.Aero as “principal scientist,” while the com­pany’s engineering chief, Eric Allison, took over as chief executive officer. Under Allison, the company began work on a simpler, more conventional-looking design, now coming to life at the Hollister Municipal Airport.

Hollister is a city of about 35,000 nestled among garlic and artichoke farms. Its airport is popular among amateur pilots because of favorable winds and a lack of commercial air traffic. There’s a flight school, a sky-diving business, and a few run-down buildings. The least shabby structure is Building 19, which has been taken over by a dozen or so Zee.Aero workers.

People working at the airport have caught glimpses of two Zee.Aero craft in recent months

The airport is open for business from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays, but Zee.Aero employees frequently run test flights when no one else is around. Nonetheless, people working at the airport have caught glimpses of two Zee.Aero craft in recent months. Both have a narrow body, a bulbous cockpit with room for one person upfront, and a wing at the back. In industry lingo, the planes are pushers, with two propellers in the rear. One of the prototypes looks like a small conventional plane; the other has spots for small propellers along the main body, three per side.

When the aircraft take off, they sound like air raid sirens.

The people at the airport haven’t heard Page’s name ­mentioned, but they long ago concluded Zee.Aero’s owner is super rich. Zee.Aero employees receive catered lunches—sometimes $900 worth of barbecue from Armadillo Willy’s, a local chain. Recently, the company purchased a $1 million helicopter to fly alongside the planes and gather data.

For Page, this project is deeply personal. He’s been known to spend evenings with Musk, both men thinking aloud about ways to fundamentally change transportation. Musk wants to build an upscale electric VTOL jet; Page wants the down-market version. In an interview with a Bloomberg Businessweek reporter a couple of years ago, Page confessed that he longed to take more risks like his industrialist friend. He wanted to dabble with new forms of investment outside the confines of Google and back projects that focused on atoms, not bits. “There’s a lot of money going into internet startup kinds of things, which is great,” he said. “But for some of the real problems we face, I think we need other kinds of investments, too. I have young kids, so I would like them to be safe. I’d like for pedestrians to be much safer. I’d like for blind people and old people and young people to get around.”

The former Zee.Aero employees describe the company as a fun place to work but don’t downplay the serious expectations from Page. He wants the flying-car future, and he wants it now. If the atmosphere grew tense with Kroo’s departure, it didn’t lighten up when the Kitty Hawk team arrived.

Kitty Hawk has about a dozen engineers, including some Zee.Aero veterans. Others came from Aerovelo, a startup whose claim to fame was winning the $250,000 Sikorsky Prize in 2013, for building a human-powered helicopter that could stay aloft for more than a minute. Kitty Hawk employees include Emerick Oshiro, who did self-driving car work at Google, and David Estrada, who handled legal affairs for Google X. They all listed the company as their employer on LinkedIn until they were contacted by Bloomberg Businessweek, at which point they erased any mention of Kitty Hawk from their profiles.

Page has drawn a line separating his two flying-car teams, employees say. It’s common for the Zee.Aero engineers to speculate over lunch about what their Kitty Hawk counterparts are up to. The former Zee.Aero employees think Page wanted to see if a smaller team could move faster, and the added pressure on Zee.Aero didn’t hurt. Two people say Kitty Hawk is working on something that resembles a giant version of a quadcopter drone.

There’s no guarantee that Kitty Hawk’s or Zee.Aero’s or anyone else’s flying cars will ever take to the skies. There are still technology problems to solve, regulatory hurdles to cross, and urgent safety questions to answer. Page once vowed to a colleague that if his involvement in the sector ever became public, he might pull support from the companies.

Here’s hoping that’s not true. If nothing else, these projects show that bold, some might say far-fetched, invention is alive and well in Silicon Valley. The place that spent the past decade focused on social network apps has trained its engineering powers on robots, cars, and now aviation. “We were promised flying cars, and instead what we got was 140 characters,” a local venture capitalist once put it. Page and his cohorts are trying to get us both.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Those include a new revenue-sharing model that would give developers more money when users subscribe to a service via their apps — instead of keeping 70 percent of all revenue generated from subscriptions, publishers will be able to keep 85 percent of revenue, once a subscriber has been paying for a year.

Now Google plans to up the ante at its app store: It will also move from a 70/30 split to 85/15 for subscriptions — but instead of requiring developers to hook a subscriber for 12 months before offering the better split, it will make it available right away.

Sources said Google has already been testing the new split with some entertainment companies (so has Apple, to some extent). ?Google started running the new model over a year ago with video services as a way to get Play subscriptions to work with its TV streaming offerings like the Cast dongle.

It's unclear when Google plans to roll out the new pricing plan.

When it does happen, it will be a natural move for Google, which has pushed developers to invest in Android as much as Apple, where the higher-spending customers tend to be.

The Play unit is also a key part of Google's strategy to find revenue streams outside of ads.

Google has already tried differentiating itself from Apple by giving app developers the ability to handle payments themselves and keep all of the revenue. Apple requires any payments made within the app to go through Apple's iTunes billing system — a point that still irks many publishers, though they won't say so out loud.

Details are still scarce, but the project is probably designed to spur new products while also helping the company retain entrepreneurial employees, which is a problem for Google. Similar ideas have percolated there for some time — the associate manager program that trained inexperienced new hires, Google X, the whole Alphabet thing.

Several venture capitalists and former Googlers I spoke to when Area 120 first surfaced believed Google has better odds than earlier efforts. For example, Yahoo tried (then failed) with its own incubator, Brickhouse, which Horowitz helped run nearly a decade ago.

But they were skeptical that the new endeavor would breed really innovative companies.

""Startups need a certain amount of risk,"" said one former Googler. ""If you can fall back on your vesting or job at Google, I'm not sure that cuts it.""

That said, here are a couple areas where building a startup inside Google instead of outside might make sense.

: It's hard to find funding for that now, but Google needs the tech. Artificial intelligence: Google clearly loves this (as do venture capitalists), but finding and keeping capable engineers with expertise is hard for startups. Not so for Google, which has loads of data with which machine learning experts can play.

This is just a guess, not something coming from Google directly. Enterprise and cloud concepts might do well inside Area 120 too, although those types of startups haven't lacked for funding beyond Google's walls.

The on-stage demo showed that you can swipe to adjust the volume on your music, tap to change tracks, and use another gesture to get navigation directions from Google Maps. The idea is the built in interactions that bikers can use to control their phones safely while riding, as the Commuter jacket was originally designed as a biking jacket.

The jacket itself is made using Levis' standard manufacturing techniques and it doesn't need to be treated with any special care. It can be washed and worn and treated like any other garment; you just need to remove the Bluetooth cuff before washing it. And it's just the first garment that Levis is making with this tech -- the company wants to make athletic and business wear as well.

Developers will have access to a host of APIs to make their apps work with Jacquard, and the hopes are that many apps will work with the garment by the time it ships. Right now it works with your calls and messaging apps, Google Play Music and Maps and third-party apps from Spotify and Strava.

The first Project Jacquard garment will ship from Levis in the spring 2017, but there's a ""beta test"" that will launch this fall. If it works as well as it seemed to in today's quick demo, it'll definitely be worth keeping an eye on.

Google now has a mobile virtual reality platform. It's called Daydream, and it's built on top of Android N. That means it's not going to compete with the likes of the PC-powered HTC Vive or Oculus Rift (at least not yet, anyway), but looks much more powerful than Cardboard and represents a huge step in the push to advance VR out of its early stages.



From the sound of it, Daydream is a lot like Android for VR. It's a backbone of software inside Android N (simply known as ""VR Mode"") that provides users with an entire ecosystem to play around in. There will be a home screen with apps (which looks a lot like the Gear VR's home screen, to be honest), and Google has apparently already created special VR versions of its own apps like YouTube, Street View, the Google Play Store, Play Movies, and Google Photos. Other companies, like The New York Times, HBO, Netflix, Ubisoft, and Electronic Arts are already developing for Daydream as well.



The biggest limitation for Daydream seems to be that it will only work on new phones that have special sensors and screens. Google says that those Daydream-ready phones will be available this fall, and that we can expect to see them from Samsung, HTC, LG, Huawei, and more.

Here’s What Has Changed

Title tags have been increased to 70–71 characters, which is up from its previous 50–60 characters. That’s at least enough to fit in another word or two.

Meta descriptions have been increased by 100 characters per line, and extended from two to three lines. That’s a significant increase, and presents far more of an opportunity to tell searchers what the page is about.

Slegg reports that Google is still truncating the descriptions to two lines for many search results still, so you may still see them coming in at around 160 characters at times. When a three line snipped is displayed they come in at 278 characters per line.

It’s important to note that this may be a test which Google could reverse at any time. By the company’s own admission, it is always A/B testing. So it’s a good idea not to base your SEO efforts on these numbers until it’s known for sure if the test will become a permanent change.

What Do SEOs Think?

For the post part, the change has gone unnoticed. According to this Reddit thread the change in organic search happened on May 4th, and it’s only now that anyone is really talking about it.

“The analysis that I’ve done has shown that Google updated the search results layout to give organic listings an increased title tag size – as well as increased width of the Featured Snippets/Answer Boxes, but have decreased the height of the Featured Snippets/Answer Boxes.”

Commenters in the Reddit thread for the most part agree the change hasn’t been noticed. Redditor Jonathan Jones also wrote in his own blog that the change has impacted CTR in a positive way, which could be a sign it will be here to stay if it continues to product positive change.

This brings up a long list of all the web pages you searched. You can delete them all, but the option that lets you do that isn't easy to find. You can, very easily, delete one day at a time. That will take forever to cover years' worth of data, but you can try. Click on today, then click the delete button at the top.

You'll have to deal with a warning from Google telling you that you don't really want to delete this information. The truth is, Google doesn't want you to delete this information. You may or may not want to, but don't worry if you do. You won't break the internet or your Google account if you hit the delete button.

To delete all of your Web and App Activity in one shot, go back to the main Web and App Activity page, and click on the three dots at the top corner of the page. Then click on ""Delete options,"" then on ""Advanced"" and then on ""All time.""

Now, click on the little menu button on the top left of the screen.

If you want to delete all of, you can access that option through the three dots at the top right corner.

But you'll have to deal with Google's warnings on why you don't want to do that.

If you click on ""location history"" in the menu, it takes you to a page with a map, which represents your ""timeline"" of where and when you traveled, with Google Maps or other location services. Now click on the settings button on the lower-right corner.

From here you can delete all of your location data, if you choose. But if you really want to see all the data Google has collected on you, click on ""download a copy of all your data."" You can also get to this download page from your ""account settings"" page. More on that below.

Click on ""select all."" Scroll down and select ""next.""

Select your file type. We recommend the default, .zip, since Windows and Macs can typically open those files without problems, and select your delivery method. You might want to save it to Drive if you have the space. Google warns that archives that are emailed may take hours or days to compile. You'll have to be patient. It still took two hours when using Drive. Google will email you when it's done.

Google sent me two ENORMOUS 2G files on what it is tracking on me. Inside were folders of stuff, including computer scripts on me and my data. But most of it was photos. Every photo I ever uploaded since 2013, full size. Here's a photo of my puppy that it sent, and an example of the JSON scripts and the list of files in folders that it sent.

While you are waiting, you can explore what advertisers are told about you. While you are logged in, go to any Google service and click on your account icon. Then click on ""my account.""

This takes you to your account-settings page. On the left, the ""Activity controls"" lets you explore all the daily information Google keeps on you. ""Control your content"" lets you download all of your data. But this time, click on ""Ads settings,"" then scroll down and click on ""Manage ad settings.""

This is what Google thinks I'm into. Some stuff is accurate: bikes, fitness, books, food & drink, mobile phones. Some is not: East Asian Music? Banking? Cleaning Agents? Rap & Hip-Hop?

A new report has found that Russia's criminal underworld is trading hundreds of millions of stolen usernames and passwords belonging to these accounts.

This is according to a Reuters investigation, which spoke to Alex Holden, founder and chief information security officer of Wisconsin-based Hold Security.

If you have a Gmail, Hotmail or Yahoo email account, you may want to update your password. A new report has found that Russia's criminal underworld is trading hundreds of millions of stolen usernames and passwords belonging to these accounts

WHICH ACCOUNTS ARE AT RISK? Russia's Mail.ru email service accounts for the majority of hacked accounts. Researchers discovered 57 million account details being traded in Russia. A large number also belong to Gmail, Hotmail and Yahoo Mail users. Yahoo Mail credentials totaled 40 million, or 15 per cent of the haul. Hotmail accounted for 33 million, which equaled 12 per cent of the leak And 24 million, or nine per cent, belonged to Gmail account holders. There is currently no way to know if your details are on the list of threatened accounts. Mail.ru is now checking whether any combinations of usernames/passwords match users' e-mails and are still active. It will warn users if they are at risk. Yahoo and Google did not respond to requests for comment.

Holden, who last year uncovered the largest data breach to date, claims that the details of 272.3 million stolen accounts are now being traded.

They include the majority of users of Mail.ru, Russia's most popularemail service, and smaller fractions of Google, Yahoo and Microsoft email users.

It is one of the biggest stashes of stolen credentials to beuncovered since cyber attacks hit major US banks and retailerstwo years ago.

The latest discovery came after Hold Security researchersfound a young Russian hacker bragging in an online forum.

The hackers said hehad collected and was ready to give away a far larger number ofstolen credentials that ended up totalling 1.17 billion records.

Because he or she vacuumed up data from many sources, researchers have dubbed him 'The Collector'.

After eliminating duplicates, Holden said, the cachecontained nearly 57 million Mail.ru accounts - a big chunk ofthe 64 million monthly active email users Mail.ru said it had atthe end of last year.

It also included tens of millions ofcredentials for the world's three big email providers, Gmail,Microsoft and Yahoo, plus thousands of accounts atGerman and Chinese email providers.

'This information is potent,' said Holden, the former chief security officer at U.S. brokerage R.W. Baird.

'It is floating around in theunderground and this person has shown he's willing to give thedata away to people who are nice to him.'

Mysteriously, the hacker asked just 50 roubles - less than$1 - for the entire trove.

HOW TO CHOOSE A PASSWORD Avoid favourite sports. ‘Baseball’ and ‘football’ were both in the top 10 worst password list. Birthdays and years of birth are easy to guess with the help of personal information. Common names such as Michael and Jennifer are insecure, with many making SplashData’s Top 50 list, too. Experts suggest using eight mixed types of characters, with seemingly random combinations if possible. They say that passphrases – short words with spaces or other characters separating them – are easy to recall and are relatively secure if seemingly random words are used. Experts also advise having different passwords for different sites, instead of relying on one, which if hacked, could prove particularly serious.

However, he gave up the dataset after Holdresearchers agreed to post favourable comments about him inhacker forums, Holden said.

He said his company's policy is torefuse to pay for stolen data.

Such large-scale data breaches can be used to engineerfurther break-ins or phishing attacks by reaching the universeof contacts tied to each compromised account.

This multiplies therisks of financial theft or reputational damage across the web.

Hackers know users cling to favourite passwords, resistingadmonitions to change credentials regularly and make them morecomplex.

It's why attackers reuse old passwords found on oneaccount to try to break into other accounts of the same user.

After being informed of the potential breach of emailcredentials, Mail.ru spokeswoman Madina Tayupova told Reuters:'We are now checking, whether any combinations ofusernames/passwords match users' e-mails and are still active.

'As soon as we have enough information we will warn theusers who might have been affected,' she said.

Tayupova addedthatMail.ru's initial checks found no live combinations of usernamesand passwords which match existing emails.

A Microsoft spokesman said stolen online credentials was anunfortunate reality.

'Microsoft has security measures in placeto detect account compromise and requires additional informationto verify the account owner and help them regain sole access.'

Researchers discovered 57 million account details being traded in Russia. A large number also belong to Gmail, Hotmail and Yahoo Mail users. Yahoo Mail credentials totaled 40 million, or 15 per cent of the haul

Yahoo and Google did not respond to requests for comment.

Yahoo Mail credentials numbered 40 million, or 15 percent ofthe 272 million unique IDs discovered.

Meanwhile, 33 million, or12 percent, were Microsoft Hotmail accounts and 9 percent, ornearly 24 million, were Gmail, according to Holden.

Thousands of other stolen username/password combinationsappear to belong to employees of some of the largest U.S.banking, manufacturing and retail companies, he said.

Stolen online account credentials are to blame for 22percent of big data breaches, according to a recent survey of325 computer professionals by the Cloud Security Alliance.

In 2014, Holden, a Ukrainian-American who specialises inEastern European cyber crime threats, uncovered a cache of 1.2billion unique credentials that marked the world's biggest-everrecovery of stolen accounts.

His firm studies cyber threats playing out in the forums andchatrooms that make up the criminal underground, speaking tohackers in their native languages while developing profiles ofindividual criminals.

Holden said efforts to identify the hacker spreading thecurrent trove of data or the source or sources of the stolenaccounts would have exposed the investigative methods of hisresearchers.

4/27/2016,0.527963994,0.177680203,707.29,708.98,692.37,705.84,3086722,16.61,-1.45,0,"A big thing Google's new podcast offering has going for it is convenience, especially if you're a Play Music subscriber. Podcasts are available from the Music app's main menu alongside options for top music charts, your library, new releases and more. You don't have to download another app and futz with the setup since podcasts appear just like other streaming content. As you might expect, the main podcast landing page is a top chart of the popular shows across all categories.

There's a handy drop-down menu for categories above the list of popular podcasts, allowing you to filter out everything but the comedy options, for example. Each show tile on the web has a play button so you can fire up the latest episode immediately as well as options for subscribe and share. On mobile, you actually have to select a show and head to its page before you're able to hit play.

On that main podcast page, there's also a tab for ""Your Podcasts,"" where all the shows you've subscribed to reside. That personal library is a mirror image of the top charts on the main page: a grid of artwork and show titles with quick-play functionality that starts with the latest episode. This tiled arrangement of podcast options is common in other apps, including Pocket Casts and others. Again, you'll have to tap through to a show's landing page to hit play on mobile. Here you'll also find a list of episodes with a brief description of the podcast itself.

Each selection has the usual title, description, date and run time, but if you want to see the full episode notes, you'll have to click the information icon to browse them. Tapping that ""i"" icon also reveals the option to download an episode for offline listening inside the Play Music mobile app. Once you start an episode, the run time flips to show the time remaining if you're listening on a desktop, letting you know if you can finish what you started at the office during your evening commute. Unfortunately, that run time doesn't flip to a countdown on mobile, so the only way to see how much time is left is to swipe over to the audio player.

There are also podcast stations for all the times you can't decide what you want to hear. Despite a mention and active links in Google's announcement post, I wasn't able to find the podcast stations inside the Music app. I think this could be a great tool for discovery, but right now it's difficult to find on both the web and mobile. Stations function the exact same way as stations for Google Play's music streaming (or any service, really), only the playlist is composed of podcasts instead of songs. For example, the ""Learn Something New"" option pulls content from shows like Stuff You Should Know, Planet Money and How Your World Works.

If you've used Play Music before, you know exactly what to expect in terms of the player. The UI is the same as when you're streaming music or playing tunes from your library, complete with Google Cast support. The only difference is the addition of the ""skip back 10 seconds"" and ""skip ahead 30 seconds"" controls. Those controls are also available in the Android app on the main player interface and from the lock screen and by swiping down on the notifications bar. This means you won't have to navigate to the app to skip around or hit pause, which will come in handy if you're at the gym or using another app.

When you start a playlist or album, a menu icon on the player interface offers easy access to the queue. Here you can see the list of episodes and play them without having to head back to the show page. Unfortunately, you can only clear that playlist, and when you hit play on one episode, it automatically populates with more episodes from the same show. There's no way to queue up the latest episode from It's a Bird, It's a Plane, It's a Podcast to play after you finish listening to Welcome to Night Vale or to make a playlist so you won't be interrupted by trying to find another show.

The addition of podcasts isn't seamless, though, as some key features are missing that make apps like Pocket Casts so attractive. First, the search functionality is pretty terrible. If the podcast you're looking for has a rather unique name, chances are it will appear at the top. I had no trouble finding Good Beer Hunting, for example. However, if what you're after has some commonly used words in its name, you'll see results for albums, songs, radio stations and video first. The podcast results will be all the way at the bottom. Pocket Casts and Stitcher both handle search much better; however, they're only sorting through podcasts and not an entire streaming library. And no, there's no way to search just for podcasts in Play Music on the desktop or in the Android app. Bummer.

There are also a few notable omissions from the podcast library. Serial, Fresh Air, This American Life and others aren't available inside the app. It's a bit odd, because other NPR shows like Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me, Pop Culture Happy Hour and Bullseye show up in search results. For sports fans, only a smattering of local ESPN shows are available, so you'll have to go to the network's own app or another piece of software to stream those national radio episodes. I only listen to a handful of podcasts, and I was able to find them all save for two: Serial, which I already mentioned, and Men in Blazers from NBC Sports. Missing shows is one of the downsides to Spotify's podcast library as well, and it's the main reason I still use Pocket Casts.

I have two main gripes with the new Play Music integration: the inability to build custom playlists and the omission of a number of popular shows. Dedicated podcast search wouldn't hurt, but I can survive without it. If a robust feature set is what you're after, Pocket Casts is probably still the best option on Android. It's worth the $4, in my opinion. Even so, Google's new podcast offering is a massive improvement over Stitcher, an app that goes down for days and sometimes weeks at a time.

Podcasts are a welcome addition to the Google Play Music app on Android. Unfortunately, iOS users will have to wait to take advantage, and the company hasn't said when that will happen. Of course, podcasts have been a part of iTunes and iOS since the jump, and they're only now making it to Google's Music app. By nesting podcasts inside the Play Music app, Google provides a convenient way to access the episodic content -- as long as the shows you like are available there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kurzweil is one of the biggest believers in The Singularity, the moment when humans — with the aid of technology —will supposedly live forever.

He's chosen the year 2045 because, according to his calculations, ""The nonbiological intelligence created in that year will reach a level that’s a billion times more powerful than all human intelligence today.""

But even before 2045, Kurzweil thinks we could begin the deathless process.

""I believe we will reach a point around 2029 when medical technologies will add one additional year every year to your life expectancy,"" he told Playboy. ""By that I don’t mean life expectancy based on your birthdate, but rather your remaining life expectancy.""

A lot will have to happen in the next 30 years to make that a reality, but Kurzweil isn't fazed: He predicts that nano machines capable of taking over for our immune system (to fix problems like cancerous cells and clogged arteries) and connecting our brains to the cloud will be available by then.

He likens that change as the next step in our evolution, the same way our ancestors developed to use the frontal cortex 2 million years ago. The benefits, according to Kurzweil, will be significant.

""We’ll create more profound forms of communication than we’re familiar with today, more profound music and funnier jokes,"" he tells Playboy. ""We’ll be funnier. We’ll be sexier. We’ll be more adept at expressing loving sentiments.""

Kurzweil points to two advancements that've already happened to support his futuristic claims. The first is the rate of technological advancement: His current Android phone is several orders of magnitude smaller, more powerful, and less expensive than the $11 million computer he used at MIT in the mid 1960's. Technology will only continue to get smaller, more powerful, and less expensive over time.

The second is work being done at Joslin Diabetes Center in Connecticut, which has used biotechnology to turn off the fat insulin receptor gene in animals, allowing them to eat large quantities of food without developing diabetes or gaining weight. By hacking the human body we can ditch millennia-old genes that serve no purpose and increase our lifespan significantly.

It's yet to be seen if his plans will pan out, but Kurweil considers dying before the singularity to be a failure on his part, so he's adopted a strict diet with the hope of making it to 2045 and living forever.

Sources tell The Next Web that Google is considering making Swift a “first class” language for Android, while Facebook and Uber are also looking to make Swift more central to their operations.

Google’s Android operating system currently supports Java as its first-class language, and sources say Swift is not meant to replace Java, at least initially. While the ongoing litigation with Oracle is likely cause for concern, sources say Google considers Swift to have a broader “upside” than Java.

Swift is also open source, which means Google could adopt it for Android without changing its own open source mobile structure.

Could Google do it?

Born at Apple as a replacement to Objective C, Swift quickly found favor with developers as an easy-to-write language that shed much of the verbosity and clumsy parameters other languages have. It was introduced at WWDC 2014, and has major support from IBM as well as a variety of major apps like Lyft, Pixelmator and Vimeo that have all rebuilt iOS apps with Swift.

Swift can’t be copy-pasted for any platform, though. Specifically, Android would need a runtime for Swift — and that’s just for starters.

Google would also have to make its entire standard library Swift-ready, and support the language in APIs and SDKs. Some low-level Android APIs are C++, which Swift can not currently bridge to. Those would have to be re-written.

Swift would also not be useful in bridging higher level APIs in Java; they’d have to be re-written as well.

Using Swift for Android is not impossible, though. Late last year, developer Romain Goyet toyed with Swift for Android — and had some success. While that project was completed well ahead of Swift being open source, it nonetheless proved that it can be done.

That project used the Android NDK, which allows other languages to be loosely implemented into Android. With an open source Swift and support from Google, Android apps wouldn’t require that toolkit.

All told, Google would have to effectively recreate its efforts with Java — for Swift. If the company is motivated enough, it’s very possible to do so without compromising on its open source values or ruffling any developer feathers along the way.

Kotlin

Just reaching its potential, sources also claim Kotlin is being discussed as a first class language for Android.

Like Swift, Kotlin is object oriented with a focus on safety. Unlike Swift, Kotlin works with Android Studio, Google’s IDE for Android development.

Unfortunately, sources tell The Next Web that Google’s current mindset is that Kotlin is a bit too slow when compiling.

But, Kotlin is billed as a language that “works everywhere Java works,” and has “seamless” support for projects that mix it and Java.

It would be much less work on Google’s end to get Kotlin up and running for Android, but could be a tedious transition for developers.

Facebook and Uber

Facebook’s interest in Swift appears to be completely founded in technological advancement.

A benefit of Swift is that it can serve as both a forward-facing language as well as a server-side one. For a product like Facebook, that’s beneficial; apps and servers can speak to one another seamlessly, and it potentially gives the company a wider scope to write APIs for services.

And work may have already begun. A Github pull request in the Swift repository named ‘Port to Android’ was made by a Facebook employee. It’s not clear if his work was official Facebook business or not, though we have confirmed Facebook is already working with Swift internally — it’s just not known how thoroughly.

Uber’s road to Swift is probably a bit cleaner than either Google or Facebook. Though there are many moving parts to Uber’s service (app, server and API), it can use Lyft’s transition to Swift as an example.

When Lyft migrated its iOS app to Swift, it was a ground-up remodel that took a lot of time and effort — but resulted in an app that’s lighter, leaner and easier to maintain. It’s not known how much (if any) of Lyft’s back-end uses Swift, but the company has been highly complimentary of Swift in its existing application.

When could a move to Swift happen?

The short answer: not anytime soon. The reason? Android.

But Swift is quickly finding its way. Several studies suggest it’s one of the fastest growing languages around, and has blown up since going open source (GitHub tells The Next Web the language is currently its 11th most popular). Demand for developers who know Swift is also exploding, which could be all the indication these three companies need to at least explore using Swift more thoroughly.

Google’s onboarding for Swift would be long; it essentially has to rewrite every Android service, app and API. Google would also have to spearhead Swift support for Android — which is still only being poked and prodded at by clever developers in the Swift community.

In a way, Google has already begun moving away from bits of Oracle-flavored Java. It’s now using the Open JDK for Android rather than the proprietary Java API, and may be considering a post-Java life altogether. Talks in London were said to be exploratory; Google is not yet pushing to move on from Java. While it would be a big undertaking, Swift is meant for speed and safety, and Swift’s roadmap suggests it won’t be quite as difficult to use it for other platforms in the future, specifically when it comes to C++.

Though Kotlin is an alternative, it’s a very nascent language without the eager community Swift has.

Facebook and Uber face similarly daunting tasks when it comes to using Swift throughout, but can –and should — wait for Google to shoulder the load with Android. If the use of Swift is going to be as deep as our sources indicate (that is, all companies want to be using it for server side and forward-facing use cases), Android support is integral.

Moving to Swift for any of the companies also makes little sense unless it’s a thorough re-do, but it’s probably not quite as hard as it sounds. Services like Perfect prove that server-side Swift is ready, and it’s worth considering that Facebook’s engineers (perhaps from the Parse team) may already be working on this.

IBM is also working to make Swift ready for server-side functions.

But don’t expect Google, Facebook or Uber to announce Swift-y plans anytime soon. Facebook and Google both have developer conferences on the horizon, and there’s no indication that Swift will play a major part at either.

We reached out to all three companies for comment on the information our sources brought forward. All three declined to comment. Google specifically pointed to its ongoing litigation with Oracle as reason not to participate in this article. Make of that what you will.

To attract developers, the app will be free at launch with pricing to be introduced at a later date.

We’d been hearing murmurs about this service developing for weeks now. The company formally announced the service today during its NEXT cloud user conference, where it also unveiled a raft of other machine learning developments and updates, most significantly a new machine learning platform.

The Google Cloud Speech API, which will cover over 80 languages and will work with any application in real-time streaming or batch mode, will offer full set of APIs for applications to “see, hear and translate,” Google says. It is based on the same neural network tech that powers Google’s voice search in the Google app and voice typing in Google’s Keyboard. There are some other interesting features, such as working in noisy environments and in real-time.

Google’s move will have a large impact on the industry as a whole — and particularly on Nuance, the company long thought of as offering the best voice recognition capabilities in the business, and most certainly the biggest offering such services. A number of Nuance customers, including startups, could leave it in favor of Google’s technology, which not only offers an improved experience over current providers, but will also be made available at a lower cost.

To attract developer interest initially, the API will be completely free to use. Over time, the API will be paid, but likely have low-cost pricing tiers, we understand. Google may choose to raise those prices over time, after it becomes the dominant player in the industry.

Google has offered limited access to its voice technology in its products to date. Developers can make JavaScript calls to the Chrome API, for example, which are then routed to the speech recognition API. And Google announced a Voice Interaction API at Google I/O in 2015, which allows Android developers to add voice interactions to their apps. But Google had yet to open up access to the speech recognition API directly.

The introduction of the speech API won’t only impact Nuance and other speech recognition providers, but is also being seen as an attack on Apple, whose virtual assistant Siri’s voice recognition capabilities pale in comparison to Google’s. It’s also yet to offer an API for developers to use the Siri tech in their own apps.

There were hints that Google would be putting a greater emphasis on its voice technology and many use cases. For example, the company announced in February that it would allow Google Docs users to edit and format their documents by voice.

A two-legged humanoid robot trudges through the snow, somehow maintaining its balance. Another robot with two arms and pads for hands crouches down and lifts a brown box and delicately places it on a shelf -- then somehow stays upright while a human tries to push it over with a hockey stick. A third robot topples over and clambers back to its feet with ease.

Tens of millions of people viewed the video over the next few weeks. Google and the division responsible for the video, Boston Dynamics, were seemingly pushing the frontier in robot technology.

But behind the scenes a more pedestrian drama was playing out. Executives at Google parent Alphabet Inc., absorbed with making sure all the various companies under its corporate umbrella have plans to generate real revenue, concluded that Boston Dynamics isn’t likely to produce a marketable product in the next few years and have put the unit up for sale, according to two people familiar with the company’s plans.

Possible acquirers include the Toyota Research Institute, a division of Toyota Motor Corp., and Amazon.com Inc., which makes robots for its fulfillment centers, according to one person. Google and Toyota declined to comment, and Amazon didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Robotics Push

Google acquired Boston Dynamics in late 2013 as part of a spree of acquisitions in the field of robotics. The deals were spearheaded by Andy Rubin, former chief of the Android division, and brought about 300 robotics engineers into Google. Rubin left the company in October 2014. Over the following year, the robot initiative, dubbed Replicant, was plagued by leadership changes, failures to collaborate between companies and an unsuccessful effort to recruit a new leader.

At the heart of Replicant’s trouble, said a person familiar with the group, was a reluctance by Boston Dynamics executives to work with Google’s other robot engineers in California and Tokyo and the unit’s failure to come up with products that could be released in the near term.

Tensions between Boston Dynamics and the rest of the Replicant group spilled into open view within Google, when written minutes of a Nov. 11 meeting and several subsequent e-mails were inadvertently published to an online forum that was accessible to other Google workers. These documents were made available to Bloomberg News by a Google employee who spotted them.

The November meeting was run by Jonathan Rosenberg, an adviser to Alphabet Chief Executive Officer Larry Page and former Google senior vice president, who was temporarily in charge of the Replicant group. In the meeting, Rosenberg said, “we as a startup of our size cannot spend 30-plus percent of our resources on things that take ten years,"" and that ""there’s some time frame that we need to be generating an amount of revenue that covers expenses and (that) needs to be a few years.""

‘Brick Wall’

Aaron Edsinger, director of robotics at Google in San Francisco, said that he had been trying to work with Boston Dynamics to create a low-cost electric quadruped robot and felt “a bit of a brick wall” around the division, according to the minutes of the meeting.

Marc Raibert, a former Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor and the founder of Boston Dynamics, said that ""I firmly believe the only way to get to a product is through the work we are doing in Boston. (I) don’t think we are the pie in the sky guys as much as everyone thinks we are,"" the minutes show.

Raibert didn’t respond to multiple messages seeking comment for this story.

Part of the challenge was that Alphabet, created in 2015, was geared toward making Google inviting to startup founders and entrepreneurial executives who wanted to join companies driving toward products and revenue, which could increase shareholder value for those subsidiaries. Page wanted to invite top-tier engineers to join the companies within Alphabet and entice them with equity.

In December, Google announced that Replicant had been folded into Google’s advanced research group, Google X. In a private all-hands meeting around that time, Astro Teller, the head of Google X, told Replicant employees that if robotics aren’t the practical solution to problems that Google was trying to solve, they would be reassigned to work on other things, according to a person who was at that meeting.

Boston Dynamics, though, was never folded into Google X and was instead put up for sale. After the division’s latest robot video was posted to YouTube, in February, Google’s public-relations team expressed discomfort that Alphabet would be associated with a push into humanoid robotics. Their subsequent e-mails were also published to the internal online forum and became visible to all Google employees.

“There’s excitement from the tech press, but we’re also starting to see some negative threads about it being terrifying, ready to take humans’ jobs,” wrote Courtney Hohne, a director of communications at Google and the spokeswoman for Google X.

Hohne went on to ask her colleagues to “distance X from this video,” and wrote, “we don’t want to trigger a whole separate media cycle about where BD really is at Google.”

“We’re not going to comment on this video because there’s really not a lot we can add, and we don’t want to answer most of the Qs it triggers,” she wrote.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2/12/2016,0.516264512,0.170898924,690.26,693.75,678.6,682.4,2129831,15.15,-7.86,0,"It hasn’t made sense for Google to continue to invest in two separate photo storage and sharing applications, as it has been doing with the newer Google Photos and the dated software Picasa. And now the company is finally going to do something about that: Google announced this morning that it will no longer support the Picasa desktop application as of March 16, 2016. In addition, it will be archiving Picasa Web Albums data at a later date while encouraging those users to convert to Google Photos instead.

It’s clear that Google is concerned about backlash from its devoted user base who still relies on Picasa, given the tone of today’s announcement. The company emphasized how much time it has invested in making sure it makes the transition as painless as possible for end users.

“We know for many of you, a great deal of care has gone into managing your photos and videos using Picasa—including the hours you’ve invested and the most precious moments you’ve trusted us with,” writes Anil Sabharwal, Head of Google Photos on a blog post. “So we will take some time in order to do this right and provide you with options and easy ways to access your content,” he added.

For those who are using the Picasa desktop application, it will continue to work as it does today – and if you choose to download it before the shutdown date of March 16, that will also be the case. However, the software will no longer receive future updates.

To be fair, the software hadn’t been updated much as it was – the desktop app may have received minor tweaks, security patches and bug fixes, but its overall user interface is incredibly dated. It looks much like it did years ago.

For those who want to make the switch to Google Photos, there’s a desktop uploader app available at photos.google.com/apps that can be used going forward.

Meanwhile, there’s likely more concern from users about the data collected on Picasa Web Albums, which includes very specific metadata about their photos. Specifically, users may have tagged their photos for organizational purposes, as well as added captions. Friends and family may have commented on some photos, as well. It doesn’t sound like that metadata has made the transition to Google Photos, however.

Google notes that the easiest way to access, modify and share the content from a Picasa Web Album is to log into Google Photos, as photos and videos will already be there for you, automatically.

But some Picasa Web Albums users don’t want to join Google Photos for whatever reason. Google is practically going out of its way to address their needs, saying that it will create “a new place for you to access your Picasa Web Albums data.”

There aren’t a lot of details about this new place yet, except that it will offer users tools to “view, download, or delete” your Picasa Web Albums. However, it won’t allow users to create, organize or edit albums – to do that, they would have to move to Google Photos or some other program.

This part of the transition is coming after the end date for Picasa on the desktop, as Google says it won’t start rolling out these changes until May 1, 2016.

Google notes that it will also retire some functions of the Picasa API, affecting developers.

It’s somewhat surprising that it has taken Google this long to end support for Picasa, given how much more advanced and functional its newer Google Photos product is today.

In fact, every time Picasa experienced a glitch and the Web Albums product would go down, I would ask Google if it had killed the service at last. Google spokespersons would always say “no.” Even as late as last summer, the company touted its devotion to the product, telling me that “Picasa continues to be part of our overall Photos offering, and we’ve worked hard to make sure that almost everything you do in Picasa is compatible with Google Photos.”

That line of thinking, obviously, has now changed.

But it does speak to what must be a still-sizable user base using Picasa software and its online albums – and when it comes to users who cling to dated products, it’s not likely they’ll be fans of this change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1/19/2016,0.396261709,0.045873744,703.3,709.98,693.41,701.79,2258479,16.57,-1.51,0,"When Google shut down its Chinese search engine in 2010, it gave up access to an enormous market. There are more than twice as many people on the Internet in China as there are residents in the U.S., and the number of Chinese Internet users is growing at a rate that far surpasses that of any other country. Google has plans to return to China in the near future, but why did it turn away from the country for so long? Censorship is why. Google effectively shut down its Chinese operations after it discovered a cyberattack from within the country that targeted it and dozens of other companies. And while investigating the attack, Google found that the Gmail accounts of a number of Chinese human-rights activists had been hacked. Google had set up shop in China four years before the breach, offering a version of its services that conformed to the government’s oppressive censorship policies. At the time, Google officials said they’d decided that the most ethical option was to offer some services—albeit restricted by China’s censors—to the enormous Chinese market, rather than leave millions of Internet users with limited access to information.

But the 2010 attacks prompted the company to reverse course. Instead of complying with government requests to filter its search results, Google directed all of its Chinese traffic to the uncensored Hong Kong version of its search engine, a move that left the company vulnerable to being completely shut down in China. Indeed, Google’s services became inaccessible to most Chinese users within months. Google’s move to pull the plug in China is an extreme example of the kinds of decisions Internet companies operating abroad are often up against: If they want to do business, they have to abide by local laws, which can include restrictions on speech. And since the United States has some of the most permissive freedom-of-speech laws in the world, American companies must adapt in order to do business even in parts of the world that are culturally very similar to the U.S. Western European countries, which receive top marks from Freedom House for online openness, are far less tolerant than the U.S. of hateful speech and images. In Germany, where distributing swastikas is considered hate speech and is illegal, regulators recently investigated a complaint that Facebook was not adequately enforcing national hate-speech law. But it’s inconceivable that Facebook would close down its service in Germany just because the government asks for more censorship than the First Amendment would permit. In countries with more repressive governments, companies routinely receive requests to take down a much wider range of content that violates local laws. In Russia, for example, speaking ill of public officials can lead to costly libel suits; just across the Black Sea, “insulting Turkishness” is punishable by fines and jail time. There are a few things that companies can do to push back against censorship-happy governments without losing access to an entire country. Lee Rowland, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, says companies should generally submit to governments’ requests for censorship, if it means they can keep delivering their services. But when they take down content from their platform, Rowland says, the company must be transparent.

“If these companies do whatever they’re capable of doing to publicize that their content is being screened, monitored, and sometimes censored by governments, I think there’s a really good argument that maintaining a social-media presence is inherently a liberalizing force,” Rowland said. To that end, Google, Facebook, and Twitter all publish a detailed annual transparency report, where they show the number and type of content-takedown or user-information requests they received, and the number they complied with, from each country where they operate. The companies also lay out their rationale for dealing with these requests: Facebook, for example, says it checks every incoming request for “legal sufficiency” and “reject[s] or require[s] greater specificity on requests that are overly broad or vague.” But even the most thorough transparency report can be difficult to access in the countries where the reported censorship is taking place. Rebecca MacKinnon, a prominent Internet-privacy advocate at New America, says companies should start thinking about how they will deal with free-speech issues even before they start doing business in a repressive state. “It’s about anticipating in advance what positions you’re going to be put in, and deciding in advance whether that’s an acceptable position to be in,” MacKinnon said. Many companies undergo a “human-rights impact assessment” before they expand to a new market with potential censorship pitfalls.

The calculus that goes into making decisions about free speech abroad is complicated. But there are few things that companies can do to push back against censorship-happy governments without losing access to an entire country. Companies can set up stringent review processes for legal takedown requests. A stringent review can make sure governments aren’t taking advantage of Internet companies to censor content outside the bounds of the law, and thorough reporting and transparent policies can spur local activism to change repressive laws. Twitter is an interesting test case. As with any company, its tolerance for complying with government requests can be gleaned from its actions. Twitter’s transparency report shows a sharp rise in takedown requests in 2015, driven in large part by a high volume of requests from Turkey and Russia; the company continues to operate in both of those countries. In Iran, however, where Twitter has been blocked for more than five years, Twitter has made changes to accommodate Iranian users that are able to circumvent their government’s Internet filters. The company recently began allowing users with Iranian phone numbers to activate two-factor authentication, a login option which can protect accounts from being hacked. Rowland called Twitter’s actions in Iran the “ethical high-water mark for resisting government attempts to censor access to content.” (A Twitter spokesperson declined to comment on the company’s legal and business decision-making, and spokespeople for Google and Facebook were not available to comment on this story.)

When deciding how to deal with censorship abroad, companies aren’t going at it alone. The Global Network Initiative, a privacy and digital human-rights organization, provides a roadmap for companies navigating business in repressive legal environments. GNI members represent for-profit companies—including Google and Facebook—investors, and nonprofit and academic organizations. MacKinnon, who was a founding member of GNI and sits on its board, says the organization provides a space for companies who are up against tough choices to confer with other members, academics, and privacy advocates, in order to make informed decisions. But she says most companies are too preoccupied chasing short-term profits to put too much time and energy into implementing long-term free-speech protections. “GNI has at least put a framework in place that’s preventing things from being much worse than they’d otherwise be,” MacKinnon said. Companies that do business abroad—even just in Europe—are dealing with an increasing number of government requests for content takedowns every year. Europe’s two-year old “right to be forgotten,” a European Union decision that allows citizens to ask Google to remove links to misleading, inaccurate, or irrelevant information about them, has opened a whole new category of content takedown requests. And growing worry that terrorist groups like the Islamic State are using social platforms to recruit and spread propaganda means that more governments are on the lookout for content that promotes terrorism, which typically violates platforms’ terms of service.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So you only need a few stocks in your lifetime. They're in your industry. I think of people, if you'd worked in the auto industry, let's say you're an auto dealer, the last ten years. You would have seen Chrysler come out with the mini-van. If you were a Buick dealer, a Toyota dealer, a Honda dealer… You would have seen Chrysler dealerships packed with people. You could have made ten times your money on Chrysler a year after the minivan came out. Ford introduces the Taurus Sable, the most exceptional line of cars in the last twenty years. Ford went up seven-fold on the Taurus Sable. So if you're a car dealer, you only need to buy a few stocks every decade. When your lifetime's over, you don't need a lot of five-baggers to make a lot of money, starting with ten thousand dollars or five thousand dollars. So in your own industry you're going to see a lot of stocks. And that is what bothers me. There are good stocks out there that are looking for you, and people just aren't listening. They're just not watching it. And people have incredible edges. People have big edges over me. They work in the aluminum industry. They see aluminum inventories coming down six straight months. They see demand improving. And in America today it is hard to get an EPA permit for a bowling alley, never mind an aluminum smelter. So you know when aluminum gets tight you just can't build seven aluminum smelters. So when you see this coming you can say, wait a second, I can make some money. When an industry goes from terrible to mediocre, the stock goes north. When it goes from mediocre to good, the stock goes north. And when it goes from good to terrific the stock goes north. There's lots of ways to make money in your own industry. You can be a supplier in the industry, you can be a customer. It happens in the paper industry, it happens in the steel industry. It doesn't happen every week, but if you're in some field, you'll see a turn, you'll see something in the publishing industry.
